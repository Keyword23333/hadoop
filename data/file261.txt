2610000 if they get injured they just have themselves to blame for being weak
2610001 todays constitutional abuses which have virtually squat to do with you as an ordinary citizen
2610002 martin luther king was the most famous of the dozens of anti war activists civil rights leaders journalists and other undesirables whose communications were bugged by the johnson and nixon administration
2610003 and of course the absence of evidence about abusive uses of the illegal surveillance program may say more about our general ignorance of the program than about the administrations probity we know that the rendition program has been against innocent people and to extract false confessions designed to bolster bogus administration talking points about iraq al qaeda links so theres plenty of reason to worry but even if bush has conducted his secret illegal surveillance in the most ethical possible way to conduct secret illegal surveillance tim lee is right to say that future administrations almost certainly wont nixons gross abuses built on a platform of surveillance that grew slowly but surely over the decades across several different administrations
2610004 rather than set a democratic example our president has instead served as a model of unconstitutional behavior eagerly emulated by his pakistani acolyte
2610005 to believe that this corruption will simply evaporate when the bush presidency is done is to underestimate the permanent erosion inflicted over the past six years what was once shocking and unacceptable in america has now been internalized as the new normal
2610006 this is most apparent in the republican presidential race where most of the candidates seem to be running for dictator and make no apologies for it
2610007 what makes the democrats mukasey cave in so depressing is that it shows how far even exemplary sticklers for the law like senators feinstein and schumer have lowered democracy s bar
2610008 in a times oped article justifying his reluctant vote to confirm a man dick cheney promised would make an outstanding attorney general mr
2610009 that mr schumer is willing to employ blatant catch 22 illogic to pretend that mr mukasey s pledge on waterboarding has any force shows what pathetic crumbs the democrats will settle for after all these years of being beaten down the judges and lawyers challenging general musharraf have more fight left in them than this
2610010 and of course the absence of evidence about abusive uses of the illegal surveillance program may say more about our general ignorance of the program than about the administrations probity
2610011 as gen pervez musharraf arrested judges lawyers and human rights activists in pakistan last week our senate was busy demonstrating its own civic mettle chuck schumer and dianne feinstein liberal democrats from america s two most highly populated blue states gave the thumbs up to michael b mukasey ensuring his confirmation as attorney general
2610012 in the days since the coup in pakistan has been almost universally condemned as the climactic death knell for bush foreign policy the epitome of white house hypocrisy and incompetence but that s not exactly news it s been apparent for years that america was suicidal to go to war in iraq a country with no tie to 9 11 and no weapons of mass destruction while showering billions of dollars on pakistan where terrorists and nuclear weapons proliferate under the protection of a con man who serves as a host to osama bin laden
2610013 but there s another moral to draw from the musharraf story and it has to do with domestic policy not foreign the pakistan mess as the new york times editorial page aptly named it is not just another blot on our image abroad and another instance of our mismanagement of the war on al qaeda and the taliban it also casts a harsh light on the mess we have at home in america a stain that will not be so easily eradicated in the six years of compromising our principles since 9 11 our democracy has so steadily been defined down that it now can resemble the supposedly aspiring democracies we ve propped up in places like islamabad time has taken its toll we ve become inured to democracy lite that s why a mukasey can be elevated to power with bipartisan support and we barely shrug
2610014 this is a signal difference from the vietnam era and not necessarily for the better during that unpopular war disaffected americans took to the streets and sometimes broke laws in an angry assault on american governmental institutions the bush years have brought an even more effective assault on those institutions from within while the public has not erupted in riots the executive branch has subverted the rule of law in often secretive increments the results amount to a quiet coup ultimately more insidious than a blatant putsch like general musharraf s more machiavellian still mr bush has constantly told the world he s championing democracy even as he strangles it mr bush repeated the word freedom 27 times in roughly 20 minutes at his 2005 inauguration and even presided over a celebration of freedom concert on the ellipse hosted by ryan seacrest it was an orwellian exercise in branding nothing more
2610015 its going all over the world at a furious pace
2610016 he has had the vision to do this for years but i think most people didnt really know exactly what he was going to do until he actually did it
2610017 this is what the lord says let my people go so that they may worship me
2610018 this is for all those who couldnt say anything silenced
2610019 were concerned about his well being of course but we respect our professors and we respect their right to free speech
2610020 he believes in the right of all people and they should be able to exercise those rights freely and without inhibition and he makes that i think quite well known in all that he does
2610021 i didnt really think it was going to be a big deal
2610022 but i think all of the rules are out the window right now with this incident
2610023 he is a very good leader and we just know the word of god
2610024 had to get on the move now im at a kind of amusement park enjoying the day
2610025 hes on the run on the move undercover in china and authorities are looking for him

2610029 turned its face toward pakistan and attacks on the pakistani government and pakistan people
2610030 calming tensions between pakistan and india and greatly strengthening a traditionally tenuous relationship with emerging power india
2610031 the calming of india pakistani tensions to the extent that its actually happened which is still not much
2610032 i think theres been a certain amount of frankly terry a kind of pop sociology in america that you know somehow the shia cant get along with the sunni or the shia in iraq just want to establish some kind of fundamentalist regime theres almost no evidence of that at all iraq has always been very secular
2610033 two years ago mid 2005 my colleague lawrence kaplan who once co authored with kristol a book arguing for the war wrote a poignant cover story describing how the dream of creating a liberal arab state had died
2610034 see the rest of chaits article for a fascinating if rather obvious look at kristols equally confident assurance that the new republic only printed scott beauchamps last column because tnr hates america and wants al qaeda to win
2610035 i repeat my earlier comment to the extent that indian pakistani tensions have eased which lets remember happened mostly before the new us deal with india was announced it was not due to the tenthumbs administration
2610036 pakistans sense of beseigement vis a vis its largest neighbor is like an acid that keeps eating away at our efforts to convince them to prioritize a fight against radical groups
2610037 our ability to actually improve that situation is very limited and maybe totally nonexistent but it would have been nice if the bushites hadnt managed to make it a good deal worse a move which neutralizes any credit they may deserve for dealing with the twin peaks border conflict in 2002
2610038 i have a hard time listening to republicans say that the democrats cannot transcend their anger
2610039 i now live in a country where the president and vice president have the power to detain an american citizen off the street send him to a secret prison torture him and detain him indefinitely without him ever hearing the charges against him
2610040 my anger isn t driven by irrational hatred in 2000 i considered myself a republican but now that party stands as an affront to everything that america stands for i have every right to be angry
2610041 actually my new stroll through the hallways of google suggests strongly that i did underestimate the extent to which the bush administration or more precisely bush and armitage helped follow the footsteps of bill clintons energetic efforts to damp down india pakistani border crises in the wake of the kargil war
2610042 anyway those nukes in south asia are a lot less likely to be used now thanks to bushco
2610043 the problem of course is that anything that bushco does at this point will backfire because of the enormous antipathy toward the us in pakistan
2610044 the security has changed and it took us by surprise were very happy especially us young people
2610045 i havent seen a happy place like this in so long i wanted to see if i could maybe meet a few girls
2610046 i only hope the iraqi people can enjoy more happy times like this
2610047 this will be the year that we take our freedom
2610048 when i went up on the stage and started singing i felt like i was performing for my family
2610049 pointy snakeskin boots tight black sweater and snazzy corduroy flared jeans
2610050 the best way to summarize what weve accomplished this year came to me yesterday during a ceremony at a place we call
2610051 since we see things are getting better i am trying to make my family happy i decided to bring my wife flowers for new years eve to bring happiness and renewal
2610052 tonight i am invited to a wedding party then i will go with my husband to our friends house to celebrate
2610053 there is no sign whatsoever that they are reconciling with each other politically
2610054 the iraqi parliaments recent passage of a law extending pension rights to tens of thousands of people denied benefits after the u s invasion in 2003 is an example of progress petraeus said in the fox interview the laws passage was little noted but is quite significant he said
2610055 theres nobody in uniform who is doing victory dances in the end zone
2610056 the goal of the surge according to hugh hewitt and george w
2610057 the american military has recruited about 69 000 mostly sunni volunteers to help secure iraq
2610058 fears by the maliki government that those forces may return to violence or form new militias
2610059 the drop in violence has been considerable and is a fantastic achievement by the u s but its worth reminding ourselves that this victory still means 600 civilian deaths a month thats roughly two 9 11s a month when adjusting for population size but more terrifying because more random it reduces violence to the levels of 2005 a period when almost every observer saw the war as a catastrophe there has been no oil law no provincial agreement no deal on kirkuk and baghdad is a myriad different berlins in the cold war
2610060 anyone who can all this precarious situation victory rules himself out as a serious commentator
2610061 men go to baghdad real men go to teheran and damascus
2610062 people sometimes talk about doing what it takes in iraq or giving the surge a chance as though such choices had no actual downside as though letting george w bush have his way on iraq policy was like letting your child pursue some wildly improbable but ultimately harmless dream why not let him try they say as though he were a teenager hoping to become a movie star or me trying to make the nba this is obviously crazy nothing about iraq is harmless our soldiers are dying in iraq our money is being spent there our resources are being diverted away from places like afghanistan where they might have done a lot more good and to top it all off we are doing damage to our army that will take decades to undo and that might prevent us from responding adequately the next time we face a real threat rather than one that exists only in bush and cheneys imaginations
2610063 announce the delivery of more than 200 hmmwvs 40 five ton cargo trucks and five rough terrain container handlers and other types of support equipment that were purchased though the foreign military sales program was held
2610064 this is only a small portion of the equipment that is flowing into iraq through the foreign military sales program
2610065 this is the second to last mass issue of badgers with 40 more being prepared for another iraqi army division
2610066 for now there is no consideration given to a reserve force not that it isnt going to eventually be a reality but for now the focus is on the fight and filling the security forces into the critical areas of baghdad filling the leadership shortages and continuing to fill the ranks of the ia to 120 clcs are joining security forces but most are going into the police forces the clcs are really local and the police forces are the best fit for these groups the clc ranks are totaling over 77 000 right now and not all are able to join and there are not enough police jobs for all to join those who are joining may not stay over the long haul but those who are joining are doing very well
2610067 it was one tool necessary but nowhere near adequate to achieve the hoped for goal and at the moment the iraq optimists are proclaiming that the tool is the same thing as the goal
2610068 dont like pizza donate your money to end pizza faces everywhere

2610072 until you have done this serious work in economic thinking jim wallis will appear brilliant and consistently christian in most of his arguments i believe you will soon discover the opposite to be the case if you dig into these issues that i have mentioned

2610075 voice actress tara platt is to do jill valentine in the upcoming re wii game she confirmed to us that the game will feature zombies or at the least zombie like enemies and plant creatures as well as a wide array of weaponry the fact that ms platt was aware of the weapons in the game infers that she is voicing a playable character and is not just doing a cameo jill being the main character increases the likelihood of seeing carlos or barry turn up as well
2610076 the same general geographic framework that criminologists use to catch criminals can be used by zoologists as well
2610077 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2610078 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2610079 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2610080 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2610081 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2610082 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2610083 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2610084 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2610085 theres a reason for this snarl and its the polices unreasonable crackdown on a bunch of people on bikes this is a last resort after over a year of the police not listening to us but theyll listen to you please call in yes call the police we want you to call the police

2610093 ill get a sniper rifle and take care of it myself somebodys got to do it we both know obama is the anti christ
2610094 right now were just trying to tear it down get some help we have no insurance and we dont get no help from the neighbors so were living with my parents my mama and my daddy and theyre doing what they can do to help us
2610095 i feel sorry for her and i want to go over there and help but i know i cant we fight too much
2610096 i just hope whoever done it they would be caught and im so sorry it happened and if theres anything i can do im willing to do it
2610097 they claim theyre here to help us and they love us and theyre trying to do whats right for us but they havent given us nothing but trouble
2610098 we dont want to do anything there for that is where the police department is going
2610099 i love the bunt it does so many good things for a team

2610102 reaching hampden was an incredible experience and a great achievement for the club but now weve got to try and exceed that
2610103 if we could manage to get past this hurdle and reach the group stage of the uefa cup then that would definitely do it it would also help us kick on in the league

2610106 well if they want access to the data outside the application i will expose that as a service interface
2610107 if the application is designed right the dba should never need to get involved we can solve perf problems with caching and smarter data access
2610108 this assumes that the data is isolated from the rest of the organization

2610113 hes english he can play in three different positions but im not talking about him we are talking about a player who can play on the left
2610114 three different positions its a positive thing but im talking about one player i dont say the name
2610115 maybe we will sign one more player if we can
2610116 i dont know when but clearly we have problems on the left of midfield

2610119 for me torres has just got to be about the best striker in the world at the moment
2610120 all this now assumes a particular importance because this debate on the extension of these two provisions of the anti terrorism act is not the end of the story but only the beginning
2610121 but the unsatisfactory hobsons choice in the security certificate regime still remains the deportation to a country where there is a substantial risk of torture or prolonged detention with all that implies parliament needs to legislate middle ranged and principled options
2610122 by turning quebec into a separate country canadas constitution would no longer apply therefore it is irrelevant whether article 43 requires provincial consent to a change in borders because that article would not be applicable
2610123 second even if somehow the constitution could be found to apply separatism violates its fundamental purpose
2610124 off the top of my head without having researched these questions it seems that a motion passed by parliament does not have constitutional status and there is no immediate impact especially with the term

2610131 it will be an entertaining final for sure but we must forget the 2 0 win against kl and start afresh kl have speedy forwards while we will be relying on experienced razak cup strikers as suhaimi ibrahim is out injured

2610138 at a wine and cheese the trick is to position yourself in advance next to the good wine and the cheese thats available in the smallest quantity this usually means its the most expensive stay there loiter and only speak when confronted by others who are also loitering seriously
2610139 excellent advice on the wine and cheese the only thing i would add is to bring a bag from the saq societe des alcools du quebec quebecs liquor commission and a bag from one of those small cheese selling pastry shoppes that way once you get positioned in the good loitering spots you can nab the products in the bag and act like youre an employee doing a recall of expired goods

2610144 the girl i feel so sorry for her parents if you want to give them the message tell them that the parents are feeling very very sad and very very mad about what happened there and we never expected that

2610155 the whole problem with this idea of obscenity and indecency and all of these things bad language and whatever its all caused by one basic thing and that is religious superstition
2610156 theres an idea that the human body is somehow evil and bad and there are parts of it that are especially evil and bad and we should be ashamed fear guilt and shame are built into the attitude toward sex and the body its reflected in these prohibitions and these taboos that we have

2610169 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2610170 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2610171 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2610172 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2610173 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration

2610177 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2610178 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

2610281 estamos de acuerdo que el banco de venezuela vuelva a manos del estado
2610282 en primer lugar porque se estaba configurando en el pa s una situaci n que pudo ser peligrosa al dejar que s lo un grupo financiero adquiriera un control muy grande del negocio bancario
2610283 este grupo financiero estaba comprando entidades bancarias y fusion ndolos y estaba adelantando una negociaci n con el banco de venezuela
2610284 y es que adem s ello va a permitir al estado tener un control efectivo sobre las tasas de inter s activas y las comisiones porque al tener un tama o importante como lo tiene el banco de venezuela y ser adicionalmente del estado le facilitar fijar una tasa de inter s determinada la cual va a obligar a que el resto de la banca baje sus intereses porque si no queda fuera del negocio
2610285 the band simply ask all wolfmother fans to please understand that in spite of their best efforts over a long period of time they just could not find a harmonious way to work together
2610286 the first reports of a wolfmother break up happened more than a year ago pretty much after they became quite famous when they took off in the us
2610287 apparently there were some ego problems between andrew stockdale the singer and the other two guys as often happens when a band reaches international success
2610288 this is what tim said it looked like there were two different acts going on up there the two guys were one band and andrew was another
2610289 obviously when you start hearing about these things and then call the managers and they dont deny these things these days thats almost as good as confirming it

2610349 but if there are 1000 people in england in one place how many of them are going to be racist realistically its going to be more than one if an idiot took that opportunity to act upon his ignorance then hes pathetic the branding of the whole festival as racist is pretty weak though
2610350 i wouldnt say there was a racial element to what most people were doing i really wouldnt
2610351 i know the history of download and that its really central to the metal scene that the fans are passionate and protective of their music
2610352 with maybe two exceptions in dizzee rascal and roots manuva black music is seen as being ignorant shallow and soulless
2610353 theres no infrastructure for grime or hip hop outside of a few radio stations that are barely listened to and a couple of tv channels that actually seem to go out of their way to make grime and hip hop look like the most ignorant pointless music in the world
2610354 when you are literally tailoring your music to specific sub divisions of radio broadcasters youre in trouble
2610355 how can the art be taken seriously when as an artist you have to bend over backwards fuck yourself twice and eat your own shit just to be heard by white audiences
2610356 in 2002 3 i tried my hand as a promoter and actually wanted to bring hip hop music to the indie kids in an indie world with an indie atmosphere
2610357 we had a venue ready to go in the west end we had acts on standby we had branding we had concepts we actually had partnership from the main hip hop magazine in britain and one of the key indie websites at the time but at the last minute the gig was pulled because a government letter went out to local councils who forwarded them on to local venue managers telling them not to promote any hip hop nights that summer
2610358 its funny how when you have punch ups at a rock gig they call it moshing but at a hip hop show its a riot
2610359 actual music fans in this country want lethal bizzle they want dizzee rascal they want roots manuva
2610360 if you offer dizzee to 6music listeners they react xfm and 6music are responsible for pushing roots manuva the streets and dizzee rascal into the space that theyre currently in but since then the creation of a black ghetto at the bbc and mtv has made it very very difficult to cross that boundary
2610361 dizzee was quite vocal around the release of his last album that he was struggling to reach the fans in this country that took to him on boy in da corner because he was being sectioned into a world that is way too small for his talent and his profile so when lethal bizzle tries to step out of his remit his ghetto he gets abuse to the extent that he got it at download festival
2610362 the word that keeps getting used with me is polarise 1xtra is the station for the blacks nothing really ever makes it off there on to the main station it boxes it all off man thats what polarises people
2610363 can a tinchy stryder single work next to a good shoes single absolutely
2610364 it does its what theyre playing in the indie clubs around the country but the system currently does not allow that to be possible on the mix shows perhaps zane lowe annie mac bobby friction mtv 2 maybe but when it comes down to it as a hip hop fan in britain i would not be hearing metal indie or anything with a guitar you simply would not hear it in your world as an indie fan im hearing very little hip hop music and as a metal fan im pretty much hearing none is that racist probably
2610365 thats fundamentally wrong you can look at radio 1s mainstream output and radio 1s specialist output we had police on my back by lethal bizzle on our b list play list last year and we added tynchy stryder yesterday weve had strong support for dizzee rascal for many years now
2610366 dizzee rascal right now is enjoying being on our a list
2610367 absolutely fundamentally not when 1xtra launched people were really worried that this was going to happen they thought that it would be an excuse for radio 1 not to play black music but its fundamentally not the case

2610371 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2610372 they were so excited theyre rvers so they can go anywhere on the road find a computer go into the phoenix public library catalogue download a book and play it while they drive down the highway
2610373 we also know we are touching only a small percentage of each librarys patrons
2610374 its a like this nice secret that we of course dont want to be kept secret
2610375 material that doesnt take up shelf space and is available 24 7 thats really attractive for libraries
2610376 for all those reasons and the fact that georgia has demonstrated that it is a close ally we cannot simply sit by and say so be it what does south ossetia mean to us
2610377 said janusz bugajski director of the new european democracies project at the center for strategic and international studies
2610378 russian officials believe that it was the usa that orchestrated the current conflict the chairman of the state duma committee for security vladimir vasilyev believes that the current conflict is south ossetia is very reminiscent to the wars in iraq and kosovo
2610379 helped to train the kosovo liberation army before natos bombing of yugoslavia
2610380 known for its extensive links to albanian and european crime syndicates the kla was supported from the outset in the mid 1990s by the cia and germanys intelligence agency the bundes nachrichten dienst bnd in the course of the 1999 war the kla was supported directly by nato
2610381 the kla had extensive links to al qaeda which was also involved in military training mujahideen mercenaries from a number of countries integrated the ranks of the kla which was involved in terrorist activities as well as political assassinations
2610382 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2610383 the rapid increase in us strategic influence in the caucasus has alarmed russian policy planners moscow is keen to take steps to shore up its eroding position in the region however russian officials have limited options with which to counter us moves while at the same time maintaining cordial relations with washington
2610384 the most prominent us moves in the caucasus are the decision to dispatch military advisers to georgia and a march 29 state department announcement on the lifting of an arms embargo imposed on armenia and azerbaijan both actions have the potential to tilt the military establishments of all three caucasus nations away from russia and towards nato
2610385 the rose revolution was not a simple uprising but was aided by the cia and ambassador richard miles think serbia from early 2002 onwards the cia had been operating in georgia supposedly to combat al qaeda
2610386 spokesmen for the state department and the c i a declined to confirm that mr woodruff was working for the intelligence agency but high ranking administration officials said he was adding that he was not spying on georgian officials but was training mr eduard shevardnadzes security forces
2610387 georgia was rocked by opposition rallies for six days last november as protesters occupied central tbilisi demanding saakashvilis resignation over allegations of corruption and increasing authoritarianism
2610388 the georgian leader responded by sending in riot police to crack down on protesters on november 7 over 500 people were injured according to human rights watch as police used rubber bullets tear gas and water cannons to break up the demonstrations
2610389 a total of around 1 650 soldiers form the us georgia and several other east european countries have begun exercises on the formerly russian controlled vaziani base the georgian defense ministry said

2610391 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert based in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
2610392 georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years
2610393 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2610394 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2610397 i do feel the point guard position is really tough to come by i think he had the unique strength component and speed component that a lot of point guards in this league dont have hes 19 years old and we feel like for the next 10 12 years weve got a position covered that is really important to have
2610398 guys that have his ability length create finish with contact are only going to benefit everybody on the team
2610399 i think i can be a leader on the court and off the court
2610400 age doesnt really matter its about how effective you are and i think im getting better with my leadership skills
2610401 but im used to playing in chicago i think that will work to my advantage
2610402 everybodys out there saying the bulls have to change the backcourt
2610403 were not going to rush into that were not going to rush into giving up some of our players thinking thats going to solve all of our problems we will be in a position as we go on to make some moves but this is about adding a player that has unique ability and he has not in my opinion touched the surface of what hes going to be

2610405 its fraught with animal welfare concerns and it does not bring back a loved one
2610406 a dead animals dna does not guarantee the offspring will be identical to the deceased it takes more than just genes to create an animal
2610407 we dont need new sources to compete with animal shelters and reputable breeders
2610408 the cells status was indeed bad as they had been stored for a long time
2610409 but the scientific technology has also developed compared with when we cloned snuppy there is no room for any doubt over whether they are real clones
2610410 i believe that booger was an angel that god rented out to me for short period of time

2610425 the drums and the harmonica solo in the middle it sounds like a battle between the normal state of mind and the drugged up very clever again listen and listen again in amazement
2610426 the beatles blah blah i personally dont get the whole big fuss

2610429 until we have conclusive results of the investigation i cant give you a definitive statement
2610430 private contractors routinely operate within the battle space and they provide essential security to a lot of development and stabilization groups
2610431 i dont know whether they had a legitimate target or not theres going to be an investigation into all of this activity
2610432 it would be impossible to achieve what were achieving here
2610433 his best friend describes him as a no nonsense kind of guy who lived like people dreamed he was a fun loving and genuine individual who was totally dedicated to the army and held his section together he looked out for his guys in ways they probably didnt realize
2610434 we are deeply affected by this loss josh will be greatly missed by his military family
2610435 when youre up to your backside in alligators its tough to remember that your original job was to drain the swamp
2610436 another young man dead when will the gods desist from taking those we love theyre all so sorely missed
2610437 when i hear news that another child has passed from earth to a better land sorrows knife returns to twist more deeply too well the loss i understand
2610438 he had a week where there was a lot of excitement but he helped us with his kicking and punting
2610439 i dont feel added pressure when its over 50 its like an extra point the key is to hit them solid and not overkick you use the same technique and take a smooth swing
2610440 it helped secure the win thats my job when the offence is struggling and doesnt put it in the end zone
2610441 this is at least two games in a row now where serna has been a major disappointment the thing about field goal kicking is that you count on a kicker to bail you out when the offence sputters at the end of a drive or if the defence turns the ball over you expect some points
2610442 and when you miss field goals its one of the most deflating things that can happen on a football field and for us to miss the ones that were missing right now is certainly not helping the attitude of the guys in this room
2610443 quercetin in onions has decreased both inflammation and growth in colon cancer cells it has also been effective in decreasing the growth of human liver cancer cells
2610444 the point is we should think about prevention of diseases such as cancer instead of waiting for them to strike and devastate our lives
2610445 many phytos are antioxidants which have the ability to squelch

2610447 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant

2610449 killed himself by jumping from the second storey of the drum tower
2610450 there is no way he would be involved in anything like this its too awful to be true
2610451 he is a normal person and he has never been spoken to about anything like this before maybe the police in chile have got the wrong person i have spoken to his fiancee lorena and she is obviously concerned and upset
2610452 the only thing she thinks could have happened is that he allowed his computer to be used by friends who then looked at these sites
2610453 he came home to australia for a holiday in june with lorena and they seemed very happy
2610454 it was his intention to settle down and stay there for the forseeable future this news is going to be a terrible shock to everybody he knows
2610455 territorians have spoken tonight i will listen to their concerns
2610456 if i held the balance of power i would have to give serious consideration to what i would do
2610457 we listened to what people have said we know they are concerned and we have responded to those concerns with a comprehensive plan

2610459 as the jury phase is approaching in the parramatta trial an opportunity presented itself that would allow wendy to return to that appellate role and to bring in richard maidment sc from melbourne to conduct the jury phase in the sydney trial
2610460 geoff bellew sc who had been the second silk is lead counsel in the transition period over the next few weeks
2610461 its most unusual to take the lead counsel off a case like this
2610462 ms abraham has done all the preliminary legal arguments in the terrorism case and won 95per cent of them
2610463 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates
2610464 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders

2610481 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2610482 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2610483 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2610484 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2610485 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2610486 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2610487 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2610488 scour ed mr kerrys senate record to show six instances over a decade in which he cast votes that could be construed as supporting storage at yucca mountain
2610489 the kerry edwards ticket was for yucca mountain before they were against it and nevadans should not be fooled by election year pandering
2610490 it was mccain who used his influence in the senate to help foreign owned dhl buy a u s company and gain control over the jobs that are now on the chopping block in ohio
2610491 mccains appearances in ohio were completely overshadowed by this and by november 4 in the cincinnati and dayton markets this is something that is going to be known by every voter in this area
2610492 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2610493 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2610494 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2610495 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market

2610526 i dont know of anybody who has contributed more to nevada than bob maheu he was one of the most gracious men ive known he reminded me of ron reagan
2610527 there was a kind of commanding presence about bob maheu he was very charming elegant and very sophisticated there was never any doubt that when you were talking to bob maheu you were talking to a man with a commanding presence substance and style he carried himself with a sense of authority but not arrogance
2610528 he was a big part of our history in this state in the last 50 years he was a central figure in the development of las vegas and charming a great raconteur who had a great amount of history in his head in some ways he was as mysterious as mr hughes himself he loved his role and played it well
2610529 he didnt mention it by name the bay of pigs but he said he went home that night and told his wife eve to go to bed and then he put on some classical music
2610530 bob sat in his chair all that night and through the next day and did not move or say a word he was despondent because he knew the united states was not going to back the invasion he helped put together he knew those men were going to die and he couldnt do anything about it
2610531 he was a giant this guy a giant with a heart
2610532 bob maheu had as much to do with the transformation of las vegas as practically any other person who called las vegas home
2610533 when he came here in 1966 bob spearheaded howard hughes efforts to buy up a number of mobbed up hotels on the strip only men with mr hughes money and vision and bob maheus tenacity could have succeeded in ridding las vegas of mob influence
2610534 without bob maheu las vegas would be a very different and a far less successful place today
2610535 the others in the room got so jealous because bob was howards eyes and ears
2610536 they tried to gain howards favor and pitched their ideas to him like banning smoking and the consumption of alcoholic beverages in howards casinos
2610537 maheu then had to spend hours on hughes behalf arguing with the caregivers as to why outlawing smoking and drinking in las vegas casinos was not a good business move margulis said
2610538 my father was a pioneer in so much history not just in las vegas but around the world and he was proud of that
2610539 if you think paying 3 or 4 a gallon for gasoline today is bad you can imagine what we would be paying if my father did not play a major role in scuttling that deal
2610540 and just remember if it turns out we have to kill the bastard dont do it on american soil
2610541 strong values and ethics who always acted in a manner he felt was in the best interest of his country
2610542 my fathers legacy is his children grandchildren and great grandchildren
2610543 though im no saint i am a religious man and i knew that the cia was talking about murder they cia bosses used the analogy of world war ii if we had known the exact bunker that hitler was in during the war we wouldnt have hesitated to kill the bastard
2610544 but in my mind justified or not i would still have blood on my hands if anything went wrong i was the fall guy caught between protecting the government and protecting the mob two armed camps that could crush me like a bug
2610545 in bobs darkest days following the hughes shake up he had one true friend that was my father hank greenspun
2610546 and bob returned that friendship to my family for the rest of his life
2610547 my heart still bleeds for what happened to howard hughes
2610548 i often said after i got off the phone with him that i just finished talking to the poorest man in the world he was so unhappy
2610549 i have just started with twitter but honestly i dont believe that it will add that much readership but one has to keep trying to promote a blog if your going to go through the effort of writing it in the first place
2610550 about 3 3 million in government incentives for each of the 60 jobs the facility would provide
2610551 would convert coal to gas using a synthesis proprietary technology called u gas
2610552 developers said it is expected that this gas will be used to produce methanol for the chemical industry in addition they said the plant would be capable of converting methanol production to about 100 million gallons a year of 87 octane gasoline
2610553 many scientific and environmental organizations oppose liquid coal projects even if greenhouse gas emissions from the fuel plants are captured and pumped underground liquid coal fuels still generate more carbon dioxide emissions than traditional transportation fuels
2610554 stated very candidly that it may be years before the co2 sequestration problems can be solved this suggests this project is highly speculative
2610555 the real issue is the feeling of the american people as it relates to the emissions of the carbon dioxide
2610556 that technology im not sure is quite proven out so whether a five year time frame is the exact time frame im unsure
2610557 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2610558 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year

2610560 god is healing the divorce between the mainline and the evangelicals
2610561 evangelicals are those who care for the least the last and the lost
2610562 the internet is filled with blogs from people of all walks of life sharing all of their different beliefs and opinions
2610563 the way that my blog will differ is that my beliefs and opinions are correct

2610565 we are heading out on two expeditions each close to a month long to map the full length of the cayman trough
2610566 it is the worlds deepest volcanic ridge and totally unexplored
2610567 we are hoping to find several different types of vents along the ridge
2610568 some of the vents will be very similar in depth to the vents we already know about and because the conditions will be alike we might expect very similar animals
2610569 the deep ocean is our planets largest ecosystem if we are going to use its resources responsibly then we need understand what determines its patterns of life
2610570 they could be hotter than 500c 930f and if they are that hot they will probably have quite different chemistry and life forms we expect to find new species

2610584 the us commitment to maintaining israels qualitative military edge is the cornerstone of american policy in the region
2610585 this years package holds heightened significance for us security interests as the us and israel face new challenges from irans drive to acquire nuclear weapons as well as the growing influence of radical anti western forces to israels south in gaza and to the north in lebanon
2610586 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2610587 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2610588 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2610589 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2610590 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2610591 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2610592 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2610593 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2610598 the nature of his injuries were such that in spite of their efforts his life could not be saved

2610632 theres also a 9 000 pound elephant in it as in the elephant in the room
2610633 um filme americano de samurai acho que seria um roteiro que akira kurosawa iria gostar
2610634 boy have a little faith in me dont worry about the past stick with me and ill show you things you never thought you would see ill take you places you never thought you would be youll meet people you didnt know existed and youll become a part of something very special and youll know what it is you need to do
2610635 gee were here for all of 15 minutes and we meet a survivor how convenient
2610636 he said now that your dad is gone you are the teacher he said when all the hibakushas are gone you must continue teaching he stressed this was very important for a man his age to refer to you as a sensei is very special hes also attending the ceremony in your dads honor on wednesday and hes bringing people he wants you to meet
2610637 for the last forty years our thought has been trapped in hollow structures of language a stale dead but immensely successful rhetoric this has represented in my view a defeat of the intelligence and of the will
2610638 windows 2008 some apps and hardware will never be updated and you will have to purchase newer software and hardware you will need to upgrade your processor and graphics card in other words you may need a new system
2610639 the national assembly will take up ordinary business on monday
2610640 our demand is supported by every believer whether hindus or muslims in the country
2610641 like gandhiji told the people of india do or die today you should also get ready to make sacrifices and struggle
2610642 the bjp born in 1980 is in the prime of youth today the ram lalla of advanijis rath yatra too has entered his youth the party is fully behind the jammu agitation
2610643 secularism means respect for all religions this doesnt mean that hindus be shown disrespect congress and some other parties think they can benefit politically by promoting an anti hindu mindset this is evident in the recent developments in kashmir a similar anti hindu mindset was also evident in the congress led upa governments approach towards the ram sethu issue
2610644 it was essentially due to shyama prasad mookerjees sacrifice that the tricolour found the pride of place in the state j amp k
2610645 had he not made the supreme sacrifice mufti mohammad sayeed and others like him would not have become chief ministers there the present crisis has revived the old issue of the states full integration with the rest of the country why should there be two systems of governance in one country
2610646 how can kashmirs identity be threatened by the erection of temporary structures on just 100 acres of land for provision of basic amenities and that too for only two months in a year and what is kashmirs identity isnt kashmir an integral part of india
2610647 by sunday evening we will decide on the date and venue of the final and the third fourth place playoff after a final inspection is done
2610648 the ground condition is awful and we dont want the final of such an important tournament to be decided by the stroke of luck rather than footballing abilities a deferment of one month or two months will disrupt indias domestic schedule so i think this is comparatively better
2610649 as a player our job is to give 200 per cent and not to think about where and when the match will be played

2610665 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2610666 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2610667 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2610668 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2610669 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2610670 i wanted her not to tell the public what had happened
2610671 im saying you asked me about that photograph i dont know anything about that photograph i dont know who that baby is i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2610672 look gently on your servant bruce and by the blood of the cross forgive his sins and his failings
2610673 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2610674 made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2610675 he has been driven to be outspoken by the appalling prospect of his silence in the wake of worsening chinese repression
2610676 were trying to make it clear that they need to step it up
2610677 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2610678 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries
2610679 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
2610680 tough practical and humane immigration reform in the first year of the next administration
2610681 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2610682 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2610683 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation
2610684 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2610685 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2610686 he was one of those comics that was unique because of his approach his look his voice and the content of his material
2610687 bernie fell into that category of people who were inherently different like when you saw them you knew they were different and when they spoke you knew they were different
2610688 as comics were all brothers and ill miss him a lot he was a good friend of mine
2610689 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
2610690 when i showed up to work he said something to me that had never been said to me on a set before
2610691 he said baby girl the script here is not the bible do you and ill follow i got mine you get yours when he said that i knew everything was going to be all right i was happy to have the freedom to make up some funny with him it was simply delicious
2610692 my working experiences with bernie were so amazing that from that point on i wouldnt have cared if he called me in the middle of the night to come and be in a scene where i didnt have anything to do but sit in the background and eat cereal i wouldve just done it because i loved him like that
2610693 for the life of me i cant image that being a proportionate response to the charge that georgia has attacked russian peacekeepers
2610694 its hard for us to understand what russias plan is here
2610695 i do sense an emerging unified view among our key allies
2610696 towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict
2610697 we think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction
2610698 we had a hard fought campaign and it was exciting it was a bit like the proverbial rollercoaster but we are now unified and ready to go forward together and it is imperative that each and every one of us think about how were going to help in this election
2610699 we are one party we share one vision and we believe as democrats as independents and repentant republicans in the progress we can make together
2610700 were still working out the mechanics of the four days and our staffs are in communication with sen clintons staffs but i dont anticipate any problems
2610701 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2610702 i know from just what im hearing theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen
2610703 there hasnt been controversy other than what you guys are projecting right now
2610704 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
2610705 hes been very supportive i thought he showed extraordinary restraint in a fairly provocative interview while he was on his trip i couldnt ask for him to be any more gracious than hes been and supportive since the campaign ended
2610706 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2610707 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2610708 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2610709 it makes me feel good i know im a good quarterback and i can play this game and can start and help a team win
2610710 i certainly dont want to compromise my position and the things that are going on
2610711 im glad to have a few teams interested and im excited about that
2610712 with all the speculation i always knew that this could be a possibility
2610713 emotionally i dont think i was totally prepared but at least mentally i was prepared and i knew i could handle the situation no matter what it would be
2610714 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2610715 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2610716 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2610717 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2610718 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2610719 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2610720 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2610721 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2610722 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2610723 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2610724 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2610725 if anyone asks a man that he will slap you
2610726 i have them thanks to my children and now i can consider me a fan of the two platforms wii and ds who can resist
2610727 i have them thanks to my children and now i can consider me a fan of the two platforms wii and ds who can resist
2610728 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2610729 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead
2610730 even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true sen mccain continues to lie about sen obamas plan
2610731 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2610732 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2610733 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2610734 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2610735 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2610736 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2610737 ele faleceu esta manh devido a complica es de uma pneumonia em um hospital de chicago n o h mais detalhes pedimos que a privacidade de sua fam lia seja respeitada

2610739 the old theory was that to run 800m you had to run 100 miles a week my dad took that idea apart
2610740 to run a world class 800m time you run 80 of the race without enough oxygen so he started me on a programme which cut the miles to a third but had me running 40 200m consecutively with a 30 second recovery or six 800metres
2610741 i know this has occurred in the context of the olympics and that is of itself very regrettable
2610742 this has been a longstanding dispute there have been tensions between georgia and russia simmering for some time
2610743 were obviously very concerned our starting point is that we respect georgias territorial sovereignty over south ossetia
2610744 we call on all the parties to immediately engage in a ceasefire and we urge all parties to commence the dialogue
2610745 we wont be hauling anyone in well do it in the usual way
2610746 we will express privately as we are publicly our view that we want the parties to cease violence immediately and to resolve the conflict by discussion
2610747 so it wont be a matter of hauling people in it will be a matter of firmly in the usual way making our view known to the parties concerned and the international community
2610748 we think that any use of force any use of arms to resolve disputes is serious and we take it very seriously
2610749 ive come along way ive dragged my family halfway around the world away from my dad and mum and everybody who needs me back in australia and today it just feels like its worthwhile
2610750 it feels like ive conquered a huge mountain and its just a great day
2610751 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2610752 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2610753 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2610754 these results are going to be less about 2008 and more about 2009 and 2010
2610755 we will see how the timetable of the it transformation is going and how many customers have been moved onto the new system telstra is trying to become leaner
2610756 the major driver of top line growth continues to be wireless data and the mobiles division
2610757 they will come back with another impressive set of results
2610758 i dont mind a bit of a delay but the market will punish telstra for a delay
2610759 the purpose of human life is to serve and to show compassion and the will to help others
2610760 the charges against the mayor are very serious and the state of affairs is clearly hurting the business of our community
2610761 i sincerely hope that the mayors legal issues are dealt with quickly so these ongoing sagas no longer interfere with the important work before the leaders in detroit wayne county and the state
2610762 lets take it step by step i want my day in court
2610763 mayor kilpatrick thanked his team for their continued commitment and focus on moving the city of detroit forward
2610764 he told the staff he plans to continue his work on moving an aggressive agenda forward for the city of detroit
2610765 i do not think the answer should be a complete and total remand
2610766 im sure that the mayors family is going to be very happy to have him back home
2610767 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2610768 t dlicher verkehrsunfall auf der l3070 zwischen ruhlkirchen und arnshain
2610769 failed to identify target would you like to retry with external reset enabled
2610770 the fuse bit is neither readable nor writable in the active programming mode
2610771 radio buttons to respond without having to scroll to those buttons just bugs the hell out of me but i generally put up with it i guess i should learn to be more tolerant in other areas as well
2610772 an hour with a book would have brought to your mind the secret that took the whole year to find
2610773 circuit of figure 28 can activate the lm555 monostable output then a capacitively coupled audio signal surely should but realize that for your application youll want the circuit configuration of figure 3

2610775 que color tiene este ossobuco y que brillo muy buena
2610776 thats a lie i never threatened anybody with lawsuits i saw what i believed to be a civil rights violation
2610777 based on my training there was no probable cause for them to search that trunk
2610778 i dont see one single positive that tiger woods isnt on our team
2610779 i cant imagine how you can argue a team would be better off without potentially the greatest player who has ever lived
2610780 i love hanging out with the guy but it cant help but make us a mentally tougher team knowing that we cant count on him for automatic points
2610781 i dont see how losing your best player makes you a better team
2610782 it creates an interesting dynamic without tiger we become the clear underdogs now again im not sure how thats an advantage
2610783 i feel that were the guys that every time we go there that everybody has to pay attention to us in order to win
2610784 now there are times we dont win obviously but were still in the hunt every time and got a shot
2610785 its not like were not running well because we are
2610786 weve just had some circumstances that havent gone our way youll have that
2610787 in nine years weve won four races if you cant be counted as a factor after that i dont know when they do count you as a factor
2610788 when you have a day like we had last year at the glen and the laps that we were ahead of jeff we could drive away from him a little bit it makes you feel good
2610789 i know what it should feel like to go fast
2610790 were working way way too hard for these types of finishes
2610791 the european market has been growing year by year and its certainly been a hope of ours that it would become a viable alternative for players
2610792 the luxury tax in the nba has put a crimp on what teams can spend so players are looking for alternatives
2610793 in fact we see this as a positive indication of how popular the sport of basketball is on a global basis
2610794 italy greece russia 40 million a year yeah im there as simple as that
2610795 if it happens it happens id be surprised if it did with players of that caliber
2610796 but certainly we would deal with it if it happened and i continue to think that the nba will be the gold standard for the top players in the world for a long time to come
2610797 it just shows you what a global game basketball is that there are good leagues and leagues that are willing to pay for high caliber talent
2610798 the more money they get the better they feel about the commitment
2610799 but no matter what i do or what i get involved with in the end i just want to be known as a skater
2610800 tony is such an iconic figure in these sports and thats not going to change
2610801 the tony hawk brand still lives in so many ways from the huckjam to the video games to clothing and apparel becoming irrelevant certainly is not a concern of his
2610802 we all understand too that it takes money to make things happen we want to take our show out on the road and showcase our talents and the only way to do that is through corporate sponsors and such
2610803 i just maintain a consistent skating level so every time i go back im not afraid to try something that may be more difficult or more dangerous
2610804 i imagine if i was 50 that might sound ridiculous but at the same time i never thought id be doing this at 40 and here i am at a top level and i love it as long as i feel like ive got my skills in check and i walk the walk im doing it on this level
2610805 its hard to believe how big the salmon are up here right now
2610806 seriously the average salmon at rivers inlet is 40 pounds and up and theres 50 60 and 70 pounders
2610807 i dont know what happened because they sold all the tickets
2610808 i played for two years starting when i was 14 in rio but a lot of us play brazilians have three sports futebol soccer volleyball and foot volley which is a combination of the two
2610809 some of us went to athens as well and it was so great we decided to bring all our friends to this one its fantastic brilliant
2610810 its always good to have aussies out here cheering their guts out
2610811 im sure the crowds will come as the competition continues
2610812 i think they actually got hold of the actual cd they used in athens
2610813 its the same stadium same music its pretty much on the spot
2610814 i know people are trying to get tickets now and they cant get them so i dont have the answer why people arent showing up
2610815 deep breath thats it just a deep breath and a sigh
2610816 its kind of one of those things in the back of the mind
2610817 you dont want the whole season to go for naught
2610818 to win what would have been 48 games not get over that hump we just had to do it
2610819 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2610820 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2610821 the old theory was that to run 800m you had to run 100 miles a week my dad took that idea apart
2610822 to run a world class 800m time you run 80 of the race without enough oxygen so he started me on a programme which cut the miles to a third but had me running 40 200m consecutively with a 30 second recovery or six 800metres
2610823 the prevailing opinion is that we should be moving away from wiki markup and towards pure html the question is just the best way of getting there
2610824 the prevailing opinion is that we should be moving away from wiki
2610825 it is easier to optimize correct code than to correct optimized code
2610826 the prevailing opinion is that we should be moving away from wiki markup and towards pure html the question is just the best way of getting there
2610827 it is easier to optimize correct code than to correct optimized code
2610828 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2610829 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2610830 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established

2610833 this is the first in what we hope becomes an annual tradition here in astoria
2610834 our hope is to attract new people to the market and give our regulars something different to experience
2610835 events like this also allow us to support the community on a broader level while promoting the astoria sunday market and historic downtown astoria as a vacation destination

2610908 when you connect you are authentic i love you stay who you are
2610909 predictable a bit of a mess in part the same thing week after week after week in danger of becoming a bit boring
2610910 would have been safer to stick to the melody a little safe good
2610911 it was a mess you didnt hit the right notes not enough time for that song
2610912 i love seeing you not necessarily your best performance but
2610913 a very weird show this is all getting a bit strange
2610914 much more caberet than last week not a very smart move
2610915 she didnt think america would pick her instead of alaina whitaker the girl has no self confidence what she doesnt know is that they just love it when she impersonates the celebrities she should have done britney spears tonight to secure her place in the top 12 she kind of sucked
2610916 how can you say that to someone i think its offensive amanda overmyer
2610917 she seems to have adopted the robbie carrico look in her pre performance video i dont know the song but it rocks a great choice for her but im wondering how well she customized it
2610918 irish girl who can sing but probably looks too old and too married for the ai people did you see her tattoos they always show you inside her mouth when shes doing those loud long notes you can see her tongue its a bit weird
2610919 shes an atypical girl she has a real nice powerful country voice not perfect but charming her tongue looks red though they only showed it from the side unlike carlys that they show right up front
2610920 simon thinks shes forgetable hes not right who cant remember kristy the one who sold her horse and never watches r rated movies shes the tall blonde maybe simon has something with blond country girls or blonds in general ramiele malubay
2610921 my favorite female contestant isnt she cute trying to look her age tonight she has a good voice but i dont know somethings missing
2610922 because youre so little and cute it was quite good but didnt hear the big money performance he was looking for brooke white
2610923 theres something with her voice its not clear enough almost like shes coughing but shes ok not a bad performance compared to what ive heard so far
2610924 very short comments from the judges they probably told them that their time was up
2610925 simon doesnt think it was as good as last week thats the least i would say
2610926 hes still a big fan of michael but hes not overwhelmed by the performance
2610927 thats the kind of thing they would say to jordin sparks last season
2610928 how far does it have to be for the relationship to be considered long distance
2610929 if i drive my ass down there today it better be an emergency or i better be getting something damn good when i arrive
2610930 a gente tem de arriscar ainda bem que conseguimos marcar o gol da vantagem
2610931 at the very least he and his mps and the party are guilty of gross hypocrisy official scrutiny might reveal if they are guilty of worse
2610932 it is hard to conclude other than that he is a liar and that his actions or those of his party verge on the corrupt
2610933 i think from an organizational standpoint and roster standpoint its about what we expected im obviously disappointed with the results we felt we had a nice season in 2006 we wanted to win the big 12 north and we did not last year we failed to reach one of our basic objectives which was to have a winning season and go to a bowl game in both years we failed to beat our in state rival and had a couple of other challenging situations mostly on defense i think everyone here clearly knows that you have to have good defense or you are going to lose so all of our efforts have been towards improving our defensive effort in these last two years the biggest lesson weve learned is that if you can play good defense in this league with the absolute volume of points that are being scored and if you can hold those points down you have a good chance to win a year ago we didnt do that and so that is our objective going into this year
2610934 as far as his development i think it is pretty clear that he has all the tools and his best football is here now and in the future one of the things we talked about a pretty good length this off season was passing efficiency although he had a lot of good things occur we were not where we wanted to be as far as passing efficiency and we think that is a real key for us this year i think warren ruggiero has done a terrific job with him from fundamentals and all that aspect and how he is delivering the ball is terrific understanding progression and what is happening out there managing the game he understands that it is his team and his time we are putting a lot on his shoulders this year
2610935 both of them having lost them at different times last year gave us some difficulty but one of the positive things from that was they both worked hard and very positively to come back in a way that really gained the respect of their teammates
2610936 running back is one of the things with a lot of questions and a lot of unknowns
2610937 i think the way that last season ended the coaches and the players did a terrific job of being very positive and proactive as to what they could control our players did a great job in the weight room with coach
2610938 they are all doing a great job brandon banks aubrey quarles and all of them are doing a great job they are all well rounded in their skills they can do a lot of things they are just doing a good job overall of learning the system and translating it into big plays
2610939 i feel really in sync with the offense coach dave brock is doing a great job of coaching us hard and the players are responding to it im looking forward to the season
2610940 there is so much depth right now i think that is what is making camp better we were so thin through the end of last year it was hard for us to do well you want to build on all the talent you have and create your depth so that there is not a drop off
2610941 i think they are going to help a lot you cant deny what these guys bring to the table a lot of these guys already have the physical ability an 18 or 19 year old kid is not going to have the size and strength that you are going to need at the division i level
2610942 i feel that we have to step up the running game regardless of who is returning i have been very impressed with some of our young running backs in my eyes i see our running game improving from last season
2610943 i dont know that id say generally the tides turning against labor
2610944 these are always case by case bases its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2610945 in the community so far as the federal government is concerned i continue to get good feedback from the public who indicate theyre pleased that weve been implementing our election promises and they believe that the government is doing a good job
2610946 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up
2610947 i didnt detect many federal issues running through the northern territory campaign i think it is always very dangerous to try and extrapolate state results on to federal results or vice versa
2610948 thats a lie i never threatened anybody with lawsuits i saw what i believed to be a civil rights violation
2610949 based on my training there was no probable cause for them to search that trunk
2610950 jelas sekali kalau manchester city memiliki ritme yang berbeda dibanding kami mengingat mereka akan segera memulai kompetisi bagaimanapun juga dengan banyaknya pemain kami yang basen kami tetap berusaha menguasai pertandingan
2610951 saya melihat sebuah kemajuan kecil tapi kami masih jauh dari kondisi terbaik saya ingin sebuah tim yang berpikir soal musim depan bukan berpikir soal pertandingan ujicoba kecil

2610958 a farming experiment at the university of california davis has found that organically grown tomatoes are richer in certain kinds of flavonoids than conventionally grown tomatoes and one researcher is curious to determine why this may be so far the researchers have found that the organic tomatoes have almost double the concentration of two types of flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol which are considered to be healthful plant compounds with potent antioxidant activity the 10 year mean levels of quercetin were 79 percent higher than those in conventional tomatoes and levels of kaempferol were 97 percent higher
2610959 diesel was having allot of diarrhea just constant we were always changing his food around but it didnt work so finally we brought him to the vet
2610960 they said usually this kind of infection was in standing water of fecal mater and the only thing we could think of is around this area
2610961 we are waiting off especially andrea my fiance shes really skeptical about coming back because of standing water they havent really fixed it yet
2610962 different races may differ in mean iq whites mean 100

2610964 it sunk on me and handcuffed me and i dropped it
2610965 i gave then an extra out and they did everything they needed to do with it
2610966 i like to create some movement steal some bases and hit and run if we have an opportunity to thats no secret
2610967 but youve got to have base runners to do those things
2610968 there are no superlatives that can adequately honor jim mckay he meant so much to so many people he was a founding father of sports television one of the most respected commentators in the history of broadcasting and journalism
2610969 for more than 60 years he brought sports into the homes of americans on wide world of sports the olympics and many other programs that captured the essence of the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat
2610970 jim was the ultimate colleague having helped generations of people who have now taken his mantle he was also a warm and devoted family man my thoughts and prayers go out to his wife margaret sean and mary for their loss and i know that countless people around the world have been touched by this great man we will miss him
2610971 we need guys that are future stars on that diamond if were going to win a world series
2610972 we think eric has that type of potential to be that type of guy
2610973 we welcome scrutiny here this is something that should be scrutinized
2610974 referees a f and g were officiating a playoff series between teams 5 and 6 in may of 2002 it was the sixth game of a seven game series and a team 5 victory that night would have ended the series however tim learned from referee a that referees a and f wanted to extend the series to seven games tim knew referees a and f to be company men always acting in the interest of the nba and that night it was in the nbas interest to add another game to the series referees a and f heavily favored team 6 personal fouls resulting in obviously injured players were ignored even when they occurred in full view of the referees conversely the referees called made up fouls on team 5 in order to give additional free throw opportunities for team 6 their foul calling also led to the ejection of two team 5 players the referees favoring of team 6 led to that teams victory that night and team 6 came back from behind to win that series
2610975 my first thought upon hearing donaghys allegation was i knew it
2610976 im not going to say there was a conspiracy i just think something wasnt right it was unfair we didnt have a chance to win that game
2610977 tim gave information on how top executives of the nba sought to manipulate games using referees to boost ticket sales and television ratings
2610978 he also described how nepotism played a far greater role than qualifications in a number of referee hirings
2610979 tim explained the league officials would tell referees that they should withhold calling technical fouls on certain star players because doing so would hurt ticket sales and television ratings
2610980 as an example tim explained how there were times when a referee supervisor would tell referees that nba executive x did not want them to call technical fouls on star players or remove them from the game in january 2000 referee d went against these instructions and elected a star player in the first quarter of the game referee d later was privately reprimanded by the league for that ejection
2610981 tim described one referees use of a teams practice facility to exercise and anothers frequent tennis matches with a teams coach
2610982 team 3 lost the first two games in the series and team 3s owner complained to nba officials team 3s owner alleged that referees were letting a team 4 player get away with illegal screens nba executive y told referee supervisor z that the referees for that game were to enforce the screening rules strictly against that team 4 player referee supervisor z informed the referees about his instructions as an alternate referee for that game tim also received these instructions
2610983 my reaction to donaghys lawyer are that clearly as the date of sentencing gets closer and the things that hes thrown against the wall havent stuck hes rehashing a variety of things that have been given to the u s attorney and the fbi fully investigated and are baseless
2610984 we have been asked to cooperate for the last year by providing people and answering questions and weve done that and our understanding is that the investigation is just about wrapped up waiting for the sentencing of mr donaghy and as he continues desperately to somehow get out of the fact that he is subject to a longer sentence possibly than his co conspirators there are this continuing flow of allegations from dont forget an admitted felon so theyre baseless
2610985 was that after the fifth game after we had the game stolen away from us after a bad call out of bounds and gave the ball back to sacramento and they made a 3 point shot
2610986 theres a lot of things going on in these games and theyre suspicious but i dont want to throw it back to there
2610987 nobody else can go to that extreme they referee what they see in front of them you know a lot of things have happened in the course of the tim donaghy disposition i think we have to weigh it as it comes out and we all think that probably referees should be under a separate entity than the nba entirely i mean thats what wed like to see probably in the nba it would just be separate and apart from it but i dont think thats going to happen
2610988 tim donaghy has had honesty and credibility issues from the get go
2610989 he is a convicted felon who has not yet been sentenced for the criminal conduct he has already admitted to he may be willing to say anything to help his cause and he may believe these most recent allegations will help his agenda im not aware of any improper conduct by any current nba referee in the playoffs six years ago or any conspiracy by the nba to affect the outcome of any game then or now frankly were tired of tim donaghys cat and mouse games
2610990 this decision was not an easy one for me to make as boxing is all i have done since i was a child
2610991 however these past few years have been extremely difficult for me to find the desire and joy to continue in the sport
2610992 i loved competing and winning and also wanted to continue my career for the fans knowing they were there for me and enjoyed watching me fight
2610993 however after many sleepless nights and intense soul searching i realized i could no longer base my decision on anything but my own personal happiness which i no longer could find
2610994 floyd was a very talented fighter no question about it but he got to a particular point where it was just for the money
2610995 which is all right its a professional sport but theres nothing wrong with his decision its a rational decision
2610996 i just cant do it any more i have found a peace with my decision that i have not felt in a long time
2610997 i am surprised a bit about the timing of it but if he decides he wants to retire that is his right
2610998 we did not announce that fight between mayweather and de la hoya so i cant really say that something fell apart floyd was certainly the name that we were focusing on for a september fight so now we will go down the list and find im sure other names that will ensure a megafight
2610999 i am sorry i have to leave the sport at this time knowing i still have my god given abilities to succeed and future multi million dollar paydays ahead including the one right around the corner
2611000 you never know but i will say the language was different this time
2611001 this time the language sounds like he might be done for good i can hardly blame him for retiring we should commend him for what hes done hes retiring at the height is there anything greater than that
2611002 in a secular world history takes on the role of showing us good and evil virtues and vices religion no longer plays as important a role as it once did in setting moral standards and transmitting values history with a captial h is being called in to fill the void it restores a sense not necessarily of a divine being but of something above and beyond human beings it is our authority it can vindicate us and judge us and damn those who oppose us
2611003 ill be one of the great players in the league and have an olympic gold medal around my neck from london
2611004 id love to be mentioned in the same group with kobe lebron dwyane wade kevin garnett stats
2611005 five years ill be 24 thats starting to get old
2611006 ever since ive rededicated my life to christ ive caught way more persecution now
2611007 but its a beautiful thing because i know its a breakthrough coming for me i welcome it what makes me any better than christ he was persecuted and ive been persecuted my teammates know where my heart is they know where my mind is at
2611008 i think god sent an angel down and said hey youre going to be all right
2611009 through this situation i found jesus and asked him for forgiveness and turned my life over to god
2611010 i can understand how it might look especially if youre not dale jr fans
2611011 i mean my fans are happy and im happy for them the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points i got to see my team and my owner and my family tonight as happy as theyve been in a long time its a pretty big day for me
2611012 we came in on that last stop and we were going to be about six laps short and i saved six laps of gas
2611013 so we were just real lucky i have to hand it to tony jr for being a risk taker hes done a good job this year getting us good finishes better finishes than we should probably have
2611014 if we pit and put fuel in it were going to finish 25th so who cares go for it
2611015 they can write what they want but we won one
2611016 im working hard to get wins but i just think weve had the best car sometimes and things have happened
2611017 and the rest of the time weve had a top five car and thats what weve got
2611018 ive really anticipated every weekend going to the race track with hendrick motorsports equipment and ive been positive and eager to get it on the race track and see just how we measure up to everyone every weekend because i got to the race track with what i feel like is the best stuff motors and cars and personnel
2611019 you can put pressure on yourself and say theres no excuse for not winning but i look at it as an opportunity
2611020 we started out and he won the budweiser clash and the 150 qualifying race and we said we dont have to worry about winning a race now then nobody counted it because it wasnt a points race
2611021 i knew i needed it but for me actually winning the game is a little more important than hitting for a cycle its not that big of a deal to me
2611022 it was just a poorly pitched game on my part
2611023 for the most part i was just too much over the plate with less stuff than ive had in the past
2611024 he was in command and control most of the time
2611025 hes still tough to hit i can tell you that much
2611026 you get in that box hes very intimidating he lets go of the ball basically right by your face hes definitely not a walk in the park
2611027 unfortunately for him and fortunately for us he left some pitches in very hittable spots
2611028 i try to look at it as were pretty lucky to be where we are
2611029 a lot of people say that if wed have played well this thing would have been out of hand at this point
2611030 mr woods mr woods are you completely out of your mind
2611031 i kept saying what the heck what is he doing
2611032 i just kept telling myself if it grabs me and i get that shooting pain i get it
2611033 but its always after impact with the ball so go ahead and make the proper swing if i can
2611034 after the chip in on 17 it was just like youve got to be kidding me
2611035 its going to take a ridiculous round by one of us to beat him
2611036 cooley i know youve been stayin in blockin me all day on third down you aint gonna block me anymore
2611037 you better start running some routes cause youre not here to block me
2611038 you make your pitches you are able to get him out
2611039 when the trade deadline approaches are the royals buyers or sellers if they are close in the standings
2611040 was in no way shape or form lame or sore but theres something amiss probably just tired
2611041 i feel for them it doesnt always go the way you want
2611042 i think someday a horse will come along and do it one day it will happen i really thought this was the horse
2611043 something has to not be right for him to be pulled up in a race so i have to try to find out what it was
2611044 im sure its not the horses fault so theres nothing to be down on him
2611045 when i got outside going into the first turn i said this is it the race is over i got it
2611046 all i saw was when desormeaux started to slow him down the first thing you expected is something is wrong he was not lame when he stopped here in front of the stands
2611047 we did really good with him winning the kentucky derby and the preakness
2611048 this is a very disappointing race now it looks like hes fine it looks like hell live a good life even if he never runs again
2611049 if big brown was himself he wouldve been tough to beat
2611050 but he wasnt himself thats why they play the game
2611051 my whole family kids and everyone have been born here
2611052 its a great country proud to be here now proud to be a part of it
2611053 its a big deal for him its really important and im really proud of him
2611054 david ortiz has been the heart and soul of red sox nation for many years
2611055 today we are also proud that he has become an official citizen of the american nation
2611056 he throws that sinker and its totally unfair it comes in looking like a hittable pitch and then it drops right down and you miss it you know its going to drop but you cant help but swing at it because it looks so good then if you do make contact its a heavy pitch and its just like hitting a bowling ball youre not going to drive it
2611057 right now hamilton is the best player in the league he can do everything he has tremendous bat speed and he can absolutely fly hes got above average power it wouldnt matter if he was playing in texas or any other place the ball just jumps off his bat
2611058 hes a tremendous competitor he has kind of an unusual swing but hes got very good power he runs every ball out and hes a leader by example on the field hes not the most polished second baseman in the league but hes athletic and he makes adjustments
2611059 its his control his ability to go deep into games above average fastball above average curveball ability to use both sides of the plate and command both pitches
2611060 its his sinker and his changeup he has an exceptional sinker and he can pitch with that one pitch but hes really developed a very good changeup
2611061 ill tell you who the best manager in the american league is before you tell me who won mike scioscia he uses his 25 man roster he keeps his players fresh he makes solid decisions he supports his players and he runs his pitching staff well i dont think theres much else to be said
2611062 hes not flashy he just day in and day out makes great decisions he handles his bullpen well and like mike scioscia he uses his roster well the testament to bobby is that he has been there so long
2611063 manny fouls off everyones best pitches and he hits the best pitchers best pitches
2611064 he keeps his at bats alive hes got very good plate coverage and he just seems to rise to the occasion because hes a good breaking ball hitter he uses the whole field
2611065 obviously he has the cut fastball and the ability to locate it to both sides of the plate hes consistent from the first out to the last out hes really effective jamming lefthanded hitters with his cut fastball and he throws so easy hes very deceptive
2611066 lidge is having a great year he puts you away quick surprised yes people thought he was soft because of pujols home run in the 2005 playoffs i didnt think that his stuff just wasnt as sharp whether there was a mental component to that i dont know his stuff now is back as good as it has ever been and pitching in philly is tough the fans let you know when youre not good
2611067 when i think of gloves i think of shortstops cabrera is good but i like john mcdonald too
2611068 hes an acrobat as far as his footwork goes hes got great hands but hes got great hands because of his footwork
2611069 he can throw from just about any position in the outfield going left or going right or charging the ball the ball has exceptional carry and hes very accurate
2611070 he has great life off the ground when he throws the ball it really takes off for him victorino is accurate but doesnt have quite the strength of francoeur whose hitting slump has resulted in what is expected to be a brief tuneup session in the minors
2611071 when i started scouting in arizona for spring training after being based in florida there were two players i wanted to see ichiro and young because i heard such great things about them thats right on with ibanez too nobody knows him because hes in seattle but he goes out and does it every day
2611072 he plays hard very workmanlike not great at second base there are 29 clubs that would take him in a heartbeat nice short stroke you could see that swing playing in the major leagues finding guys like that in the rule 5 draft is what the marlins are about
2611073 a j makes everybody mad at him but he always seems to play on winners you hate him when you play against him and sort of like him when hes on your team ill take him
2611074 if you mean dirty like he wants to kick your butt every second hes on the field i can understand that dirty the way the other guy pierzynski is i just dont see it
2611075 its just like hitting you get on a roll as a staff where everybody gets deep into the ballgame everybody just feeds off of it
2611076 the key for us is starters going at least seven innings
2611077 our bullpen has been getting beat up of late this was a good series to let them settle down and get refreshed especially with the day off coming today
2611078 were looking at both of them right before or right after the all star break
2611079 i dont think its going to be much before that though
2611080 the essence of the progressive constitutional project is to recognize positive rights not just negative rights so that citizens are not only guaranteed freedom from specified forms of government interference but also are guaranteed the receipt of specified economic benefits the bottom line is that congress would no longer have the discretion to decline to enact liberal policies the triumph of the left would be constitutionally mandated
2611081 the left makes no secret of its intentions where the constitution is concerned it wants to change it in ways that have nothing to do with what the document actually says it wants the constitution to enshrine its own policy preferences thus freeing it from the tiresome necessity of winning elections
2611082 today america watched a democratic party kick them square in the teeth all in order to continue the most unpopular war in a generation at the request of the most unpopular president in a generation at a time polls show a larger percentage of the public thinks america is going in the wrong direction than ever recorded in polling history that will make may 24 2007 a dark day generations to come will look back on a day when democrats in washington not only continued a war they promised to end but happily went on record declaring that they believe in their hearts that governments role is to ignore the will of the american people
2611083 the absence of a full throated antiwar uprising is tragic at a time when the country appears more skeptical of knee jerk militarism than ever before when this particular war does eventually end both aaei and moveon will undoubtedly claim that their narrow ultra partisan beltway strategies were the key they are after all experts at media promotion and such a laughable yet easy to understand story line will be fairly simple to sell in the same era that has seen politicians and television pundits originally lie the country into the conflict but what will be little discussed is the possibility that their strategies prolonged the iraq war at a time when democrats had the constitutional power of the purse to stop it immediately
2611084 the players may actually not mind the war continuing because it preserves an effective political cudgel against republicans actually ending the war after all means less fodder for the next television ad

2611086 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2611087 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2611088 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2611089 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2611090 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2611091 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2611092 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2611093 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2611094 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization

2611096 i had three days of instruction but as the event approached i suddenly got incredibly nervous
2611097 they gave me a pep talk and once we got going it flowed pretty well
2611098 it was a heck of an experience in athens but this time im going to live the experience as an athlete
2611099 ive been working for this for 20 years and theyre not going to rip off a single second from me my goal since i was 4 years old was to be an olympic athlete
2611100 if i have a solid shoot a solid fence a top five swim a top five ride and win the run that probably could win a medal
2611101 if i did that and if it didnt win a medal i could hang my hat on it id know that i competed at the best of my ability my biggest competition is myself olympic competition has a reputation for making great athletes suddenly collapse
2611102 the pan am region is one of the weaker in the sport
2611103 im more confident with my fence im a sporadic fencer and people dont like to face me because im completely unpredictable
2611104 i need to win the run and i should win the run

2611111 you have to make a good film that would be a good film under any circumstances

2611113 the way we developed the performance capture workflow on avatar is we have our virtual camera which allows me to in real time hold a camera its really a monitor in my hands and point it at the actors and see them as their cg chartacters
2611114 that is going though facial algorithms and going back into the camera as a real time cg face of the character you see it talk you see the eyes move it is pretty phenomenal
2611115 once weve laid down a take the take exists in the digital asset management system it an be accessed at any time long after the actors have gone home im still out there with the virtual camera shooting coverage on the scene i just have to play the take back i can do the close up the wide shot i can even move them around on a limited basis we relight it we do all kinds of things
2611116 when you are doing performance capture creatively its very daunting its very hard to imagine what it will look like but if you can see it if you can have a virtual image of what is it going to be like then you are there im still doing a lot of virtual camera work on the film on stuff that was shot six months ago
2611117 we changed the words and actor laz alonzo redid the dialogue we didnt have to recapture his body performance and he didnt have to put the performance capture suit on again we were just creating new words and we were creating a new face
2611118 were taking our virtual production toolset and superimposing it on physical production we turned the set on the soundstage into a capture volume and turned the physical camera into a capture virtual camera so we were able to integrate cg characters and environments into our live action
2611119 we have people in flying vehicles and i can see what is outside the window fed in in real time

2611190 the stone which og king of bashan meant to throw upon israel is the subject of a tradition delivered on sinai the camp of israel i see he said extends three miles i shall therefore go and root up a mountain three miles in extent and throw it upon them so off he went and finding such a mountain raised it on his head but the holy one blessed be he sent an army of ants against him which so bored the mountain over his head that it slipped down upon his shoulders from which he could not lift it because his teeth protruding had riveted it upon him

2611195 when an israelite and a gentile have a lawsuit before thee if thou canst acquit the former according to the laws of israel and tell the latter such is our law if thou canst get him off in accordance with gentile law do so and say to the plaintiff such is your law but if he cannot be acquitted according to either law then bring forward adroit pretexts and secure his acquittal these are the words of the rabbi ishmael rabbi akiva says no false pretext should be brought forward because if found out the name of god would be blasphemed but if there be no fear of that then it may be adduced

2611221 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2611222 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2611223 were all proud because this is his home turf where he learned about politics and trade unions and thanks to his struggle there have been important changes
2611224 im going to vote for evo because hes always going to support us
2611225 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2611226 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a cease fire
2611227 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on nonuse of force with south ossetians
2611228 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2611229 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia
2611230 regrettably i have come to the conclusion it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground in the council on a draft statement to the press
2611231 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2611232 a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2611233 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2611234 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2611235 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2611236 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2611237 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2611238 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2611239 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2611240 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2611241 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2611242 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2611243 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2611244 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2611245 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2611246 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2611247 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2611248 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2611249 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2611250 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2611251 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2611252 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2611253 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2611254 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2611255 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2611256 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2611257 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2611258 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2611259 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2611260 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2611261 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2611262 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2611263 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2611264 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2611265 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2611266 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2611267 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2611268 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2611269 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2611270 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2611271 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2611272 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2611273 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2611274 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2611275 reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
2611276 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2611277 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2611278 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear
2611279 i believe he can recommend charges or action be taken against the police as a whole as well as individual officers
2611280 the early stages of the investigation led by detectives in portimao really were very poor
2611281 a number of people had touched the window and entered madeleines and the twins room prior to the arrival of the gnr local police
2611282 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2611283 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2611284 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2611285 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2611286 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2611287 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2611288 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2611289 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2611290 we can rise together and form a new kind of government
2611291 we will pledge to return to core moral principles like stewardship service to others personal responsibility shared sacrifice and shared opportunity for everybody
2611292 we believe that quality and affordable health care is a basic right
2611293 we believe that covering all is not just a moral imperative but is necessary to making our health system workable and affordable
2611294 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance
2611295 demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2611296 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries
2611297 tough practical and humane immigration reform in the first year of the next administration
2611298 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2611299 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2611300 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2611301 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2611302 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2611303 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2611304 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2611305 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2611306 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2611307 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2611308 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2611309 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2611310 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2611311 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2611312 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2611313 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2611314 just so you all know we did set a record
2611315 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2611316 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2611317 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2611318 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2611319 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2611320 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2611321 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2611322 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2611323 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2611324 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2611325 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2611326 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2611327 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2611328 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2611329 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2611330 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2611331 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2611332 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2611333 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2611334 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2611335 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2611336 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2611337 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2611338 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2611339 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2611340 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2611341 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2611342 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2611343 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2611344 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2611345 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2611346 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2611347 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2611348 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2611349 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2611350 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2611351 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2611352 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2611353 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2611354 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2611355 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2611356 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2611357 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2611358 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2611359 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2611360 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2611361 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2611362 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2611363 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2611364 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2611365 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2611366 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2611367 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2611368 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2611369 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2611370 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2611371 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2611372 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2611373 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2611374 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2611375 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2611376 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2611377 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2611378 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2611379 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2611380 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2611381 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2611382 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2611383 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2611384 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2611385 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2611386 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2611387 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2611388 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2611389 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2611390 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2611391 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2611392 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2611393 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2611394 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2611395 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2611396 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2611397 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2611398 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2611399 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2611400 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2611401 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2611402 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2611403 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2611404 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2611405 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2611406 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2611407 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2611408 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2611409 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2611410 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2611411 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2611412 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2611413 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2611414 nah i dont think were going to see any tonight
2611415 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2611416 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2611417 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2611418 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2611419 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2611420 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2611421 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2611422 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2611423 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2611424 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2611425 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2611426 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2611427 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2611428 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2611429 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2611430 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2611431 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2611432 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2611433 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2611434 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2611435 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2611436 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2611437 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2611438 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2611439 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2611440 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2611441 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2611442 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2611443 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2611444 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2611445 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2611446 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2611447 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2611448 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2611449 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2611450 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2611451 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2611452 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2611453 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2611454 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2611455 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2611456 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2611457 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2611458 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2611459 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2611460 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2611461 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2611462 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2611463 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2611464 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2611465 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2611466 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2611467 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2611468 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2611469 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2611470 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2611471 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2611472 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2611473 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2611474 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2611475 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2611476 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2611477 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2611478 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2611479 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2611480 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2611481 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2611482 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2611483 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2611484 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2611485 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2611486 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2611487 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2611488 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2611489 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2611490 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2611491 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2611492 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2611493 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2611494 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2611495 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2611496 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2611497 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2611498 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2611499 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2611500 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2611501 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2611502 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2611503 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2611504 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2611505 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2611506 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2611507 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2611508 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2611509 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2611510 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2611511 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2611512 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2611513 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2611514 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2611515 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2611516 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2611517 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2611518 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2611519 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2611520 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2611521 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2611522 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2611523 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2611524 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2611525 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
2611526 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
2611527 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2611528 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2611529 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
2611530 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
2611531 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2611532 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2611533 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2611534 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2611535 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2611536 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2611537 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2611538 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2611539 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2611540 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2611541 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2611542 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2611543 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2611544 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2611545 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2611546 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2611547 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2611548 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2611549 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2611550 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2611551 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2611552 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2611553 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2611554 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2611555 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2611556 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2611557 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2611558 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2611559 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2611560 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2611561 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2611562 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2611563 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2611564 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2611565 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2611566 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2611567 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2611568 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2611569 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2611570 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2611571 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2611572 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2611573 ive been tempted for a while especially with this horse to try american racing
2611574 i took the lead because i wanted to run my race
2611575 he quickened when i asked him to so i never saw what was happening behind me
2611576 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2611577 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year
2611578 i tried everything second seems to be my place what can i say

2611586 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2611587 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2611588 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2611589 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2611590 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2611591 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2611592 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2611593 the one thing that doesnt abide by majority rule is a persons conscience
2611594 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2611595 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all
2611596 figment of the tabloid press i dont want that garbage in with the puppy story

2611598 we go to church and serve the lord and try to lead good lives and do good things
2611599 she is a person of note in our little community
2611600 here is where one would get into word studies look up word meanings for words not understood do some background reading and such working to get the context of what is being said because
2611601 how does the meaning of this text apply to present life
2611602 demonstrating the heights that can be achieved with passion and determination
2611603 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
2611604 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
2611605 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
2611606 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
2611607 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
2611608 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
2611609 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
2611610 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
2611611 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
2611612 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
2611613 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
2611614 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
2611615 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
2611616 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
2611617 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
2611618 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
2611619 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
2611620 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
2611621 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
2611622 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2611623 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
2611624 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2611625 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up
2611626 there certainly were a lot of things talked about and it was all very important to me as long as rutgers and the state of new jersey are committed to being the best were going to grow responsibly i think thats what weve done
2611627 could i have had it if i wanted yes but im part of something bigger than just football im part of rutgers university
2611628 i felt the commitment was there i dont want to do things that way when youre part of something there has to be trust
2611629 ive been at a few places and theres always some dissent its not just at rutgers
2611630 no matter how popular the program is theres always a faction that doesnt agree with it i dont feel any pressure and i dont think our players do
2611631 that stuff has nothing to do with us thats what happens when youre the head coach of a successful program
2611632 with all the good stuff comes negative stuff and stuff you have to deal with our job is to play football and go to class here

2611636 its important for us to get some momentum to get out there and play some live football you dont want to be going through the preseason and feel like you have work that needs to be done in games 3 and 4
2611637 i dont consider any of them major were just running into our fatigue injuries which most teams run into at this point
2611638 its kind of a personal matter and im going to keep that personal
2611639 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2611640 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2611641 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2611642 akulah jalan dan kebenaran dan hidup tidak ada seorangpun yang datang kepada bapa kalau tidak melalui aku
2611643 and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free

2611660 this let me tell you about this tutu my friend jktr told me if i wore this skirt id never get a man and you know what happened i became a lesbian
2611661 it wont take away from the disappointment of what happened last week and i hope that will be with us for quite a while but we definitely showed a determination and it was more like last season
2611662 the biggest problem we have is that we have built up a reputation over the last 18 months and it got ruined in two games
2611663 their attitude and determination to play was something we have not had to question over the 18 months ive been the manager
2611664 obviously the two games we played over the last couple of weeks changed everyones opinion so it was good they got that back again and im sure we will go on from here
2611665 the most important thing was to see the team in a competitive game
2611666 two times we came back it was important to see the team spirit
2611667 we have spoken a lot about team spirit and being together i really appreciate the team they understand what i want and they dont have a gap between the coach and the team
2611668 our midfielders didnt want to defend and we got punished
2611669 if you have lazy players like that out on the pitch then you are always open and liable to lose goals
2611670 players who have a lazy streak wont play for my team i pointed it out to the players and they must accept what i say
2611671 it was going to have to happen one day and im glad it has finally come around
2611672 its something to live up to and im looking forward to doing it

2611678 i am now convinced that children should not be subjected to the frightfulness of the christian religion if the concept of a father who plots to have his own son put to death is presented to children as beautiful and as worthy of societys admiration what types of human behavior can be presented to them as reprehensible
2611679 true people of faith have always tried to bring their interpretation of the bible to bear on american laws and morals its the american way encouraged and protected by the first amendment
2611680 they came out pumped up but some guys didnt come out and say im going to turn it loose today weve got to get better at that

2611683 the idea to press the vinyls off a cocaine solvent was all ulrichs idea it was a product of the simple one way thinking and at the same creative mind of a genuine asshole still you had to give hime some credit i mean it almost worked and what better way of combining the two things you love the most he was a pusher and a record maker period dont trust any of those guys unless youre the same of course marco was in on it he was just into cocaine as any of them at the time their deal was to sell a third of the records the rest was for big business purposes the big bonus if you want to gleen would probably had agreed to the scheme as well if only someone told him about it he was just out of his head not a real threat to anyone but no real help either i guess they didnt wanna jinx it too much it was a maverish stunt to pull of anyway and he just couldnt keep his mouth shut as simple as that turns out though ulrichs vanity almost led to their downfall as he boasted on and on about his genious venture it came to a point where they didnt know who knew about it and who didnt cause words where spreading real fast even though it was all very hush hush and eventually when they tried to abort the whole thing it was all too late the records were already pressed and ready to go next thing i knew the records were just missing vanished into thin air who did it marco didnt take them i know that for sure if so he and ulrich would have used it for what it was meant for and everything would have been peachy for a long time after that marco was always looking for blow and he wasnt that good an actor so he couldnt have tricked me did gleen get a hold of them hardly he just couldnt get his hands on anything cause he wouldnt let go of his cock

2611693 the fire started on the porch but it entered evidentally an open door into the front room living room area and he was in the living room area so he was where the fire was at
2611694 we heard somebody hollering trying to get out but we couldnt get the door open we know for a fact we heard somebody screaming
2611695 we tried to save them but we just couldnt do nothing the fire was too much says edwards
2611696 thats going to haunt me for a little while god knows there was nothing we could do
2611697 theres a friendship and commrodry amongst motorcycles perhaps as you have ridden down the highway seen motorcycles pass they wave we dont always know who the other person is but theres just something about waving at a fellow motorcyclist theres a connection a bond amongst us this is a way of helping that develop

2611715 m s de cuatro a os de su vida gastaron mar a y eduardo en un noviazgo aparentemente feliz que se acab cuando terminaron la carrera que estudiaron juntos fue como si hubieran agotado los temas de conversaci n que ten an en la universidad para entrar en una competencia profesional que lejos de dar trascendencia a su relaci n marcaba territorios incompatibles finalmente eduardo confes que cuando se dio cuenta de que su noviazgo le reclamaba mas formalidad tuvo miedo de continuar porque necesitaba tiempo para saber si mar a era la mujer con quien realmente deseaba pasar el resto de su vida su caso es el de cada vez m s parejas modernas que huyen de la responsabilidad como del demonio incluso cuando ya tienen todo preparado para la boda quiz s no supieron nunca que el verdadero amor no se traduce en sentir bonito cuando se est frente a la pareja y que tampoco significa estar de acuerdo en todo lo que se hace porque cuando realmente se ama a alguien se adquiere el compromiso moral de ayudarlo respetuosamente a ser mejor a que crezca como ser humano en todos los aspectos cuando los j venes sue an con encontrar al pr ncipe azul o a la s per mujer para ser felices siempre tendr n que plantearse con toda seriedad si no est n esquizofr nicos porque un mundo as solo se da en las letras o en las telenovelas donde navegamos a merced de la imaginaci n del autor pero no en el mundo donde el creador ha dispuesto para los hombres la felicidad y el sufrimiento los logros y los fracasos la aceptaci n y el rechazo y la lucha constante y permanente desde que nacemos hasta que dejamos de respirar hace poco llego a mis manos una informaci n de cimac en la que martha celia herrera psicoterapeuta del centro de interdisciplina conductuales asegura que las mujeres aun hoy conservan la expectativa de encontrar a un hombre maduro productivo estable rico inteligente paternal que cambie pa ales que las acompa e al pediatra que sepa preparar papillas que sea una excelente pareja tierno que externe sus emociones que no pida relaciones intimas cuando ella est enojada que sea emp tico ellos entre tanto buscan a la mujer de sus sue os productiva inteligente excelente anfitriona que desee uno o dos hijos cuando l lo decida que no pida dinero que sea autosuficiente independiente y aut noma que colabore en la econom a familiar y que cuide a los ni os que lave planche cocine y tenga bien arreglada la casa adem s de que se d tiempo para cuidar su apariencia que siempre est s per delgada que sea vea sexy etc etc la doctora herrera dice que con la revoluci n sexual y el feminismo se rompi el equilibrio tradicional entre el papel que correspond a a los hombres y el que estaba destinado a las mujeres los varones se asustan frente a las mujeres que compiten con ellos en su espacio laboral y que a menudo est n m s calificadas que ellos y esa amenaza a veces se extiende al campo sentimental influye tambi n que se dividieron los roles pero nunca quedaron delineados ahora la mujer tiene m s actividades que antes porque debe estudiar trabajar y atender a su familia hecho que resulta desconcertante para todos las expectativas femeninas y las masculinas son irreales y poco objetivas muchos ni siquiera son capaces de expresar lo que esperan del otro yo no soy psicoterapeuta pero se que en la vida nada es m gico ni gratuito los hombres y las mujeres hemos sido siempre los mismos aunque las circunstancias han cambiado y en este rengl n no tan positivamente como seria deseable hoy queremos que todo sea f cil y desechable pero eso no es posible en las personas nadie est ya hecho la vida entera no nos alcanza a veces para irnos moldeando seg n nuestras metas y proyectos de la misma manera dos seres inacabados que tendr an que estar conscientes de que van a esculpirse juntos durante toda la vida anhelar un pr ncipe azul o una s per mujer junto a nosotros no es un pecado pero si puede llegar a convertirse en un obst culo para ser felices al lado de un ser humano de carne y hueso con potencialidades y miserias que como nosotros necesita comprensi n y verdadero amor para perfeccionarse poco a poco si hoy tantas relaciones se rompen despu s de un tiempo de tratarse en su noviazgo es precisamente porque no estamos dispuestos a trabajar para forjar una relaci n sana sincera basada en el verdadero amor que no es solo romanticismo sino prueba constante de fidelidad comunicaci n respeto y de humanidad curiosamente la doctora herrera concluye que mientras estudian licenciaturas maestr as y doctorados hombres y mujeres no se dan tiempo para habilitarse en pareja para hablar de si mismos todo eso se queda guardado y cuando cumplen 30 a os o m s deciden tener un compa ero suponen que como por arte de magia contar n con habilidades que no desarrollaron porque nunca se dieron tiempo para hacerlo para relacionarse con otra persona hay que estar dispuesto a negociar a manejar enojos a discutir no pelear porque aunque existan puntos de vista diferentes es posible conseguir objetivos que satisfagan a los dos dice la doctora pero eso cuesta quiz s el problema radica en que nadie desea comprometerse a entablar la lucha por lograrlo demasiado ego smo dir a yo cada d a son m s las mujeres y hombres profesionistas independientes inteligentes y de exito que ven pasar los a os sin encontrar pareja personas de todas las clases sociales se encuentran frente al mismo problema son solteros y solteras se han quedado atrapados as en un espacio dentro de la sociedad actual muy limitado en cuanto a diversiones y actividades y se les dificulta mucho encontrar personas en su misma situaci n ya no se diga para casarse sino simplemente para acompa arse y entablar una buena amistad ya no existe la palabra solter n a y su imagen ha cambiado 180 grados ya no es el hombre o la mujer gris amargada vestido como fraile o monja seg n sea el caso ahora son seres impecables atractivos as de muy buen car cter que van supliendo la juventud con personalidad y desarrollo humano e intelectual que hay demasiadas mujeres y pocos hombres es una idea que se escucha todos los d as y que ha llegado a penetrar profundo en la conciencia de las mujeres de todos los estratos sociales este punto se da como un hecho apoyado en estad sticas generalmente falsas o bastante caprichosas a un n mero determinado de mujeres les corresponde un n mero equivalente de hombres a diferencia de la idea com n de que por cada hombre hay cinco o seis mujeres pero la soledad no es exclusiva de aquellas personas que son solteras hay mujeres que aun estando rodeadas de mucha gente llegan a sentirse muy solas y a sufrir de carencias afectivas tambi n entre mujeres y hombres casadas os que comparten su vida con su pareja es frecuente encontrar solas acompa adas para poder amar verdaderamente hay que renunciar a creer que ese sentimiento es el fin de la soledad y estar dispuestos a aceptar dos soledades la del otro y la propia y es que amor es confesar si yo te amo como tu eres aunque no correspondas a mis sue os y a mis esperanzas tu realidad me da mucho m s regocijo que mis sue os

2611833 disparate discordant and heterogeneous mass with their preconceptions reactionary fantasies weaknesses and errors
2611834 the reassertion of self respect in the face of generations of humiliation at the hands of europe and american naturally bears an islamic face for it is among the villages and the new proletariat in the peripheralized south that traditional islamic cultural expression has survived and it is in those groups that the ideas of individual muslim thinkers have found the mass support necessary to become a political movement of historical importance

2611849 basically we had nobody if i wouldnt have put it out it would have burnt to the ground
2611850 i dont know how much quicker we can get out there if we cant drive on the bridge
2611851 i thought what if someone was inside i have to try and get in there the smoke was so heavy that you couldnt have seen your hand in front of your face
2611852 catholics have already begun deep personal prayer and reparation to god for such grievous actions at the same time we should all be aware that persons who say and do such things as we have seen and heard obviously do not value or for some reason are not able to value the rights or beliefs of others therefore we also hold the perpetrators of such acts in our prayers calling upon the spirit to lead them to a conversion of heart and mind even as we seek justice we join all persons of good will who value a free society where people of different faiths thrive together in a wonderful and passionate pursuit of justice peace tolerance and mutual respect we envision a new world where all live as brothers and sisters catholics and their friends do not seek retaliation but a sense of contrition and reparation so that healing can continue we long for the day when such actions against any religious person will be seen as a true hate crime against all humanity

2611859 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2611860 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2611861 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2611862 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2611863 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2611864 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2611865 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2611866 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2611871 i dont consider any of them major were just running into our fatigue injuries which most teams run into at this point
2611872 its kind of a personal matter and im going to keep that personal
2611873 i dont know that id say generally the tides turning against labor
2611874 these are always case by case bases its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2611875 in the community so far as the federal government is concerned i continue to get good feedback from the public who indicate theyre pleased that weve been implementing our election promises and they believe that the government is doing a good job

2611922 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2611923 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2611924 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2611925 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2611926 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2611927 are you tired of working out and it not working out
2611928 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2611929 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2611930 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2611931 we just didnt feel like at this time we could prove it beyond a reasonable doubt
2611932 dr bass feels terrible about the passing of these individuals
2611933 they were his patients and he treated them but he was not responsible legally or otherwise for their unfortunate deaths
2611934 he has a complete and utter disdain for human life the laws the regulations
2611935 fans had heard he was going to watch former doctor who star catherine so they turned up in force complete with props
2611936 he was very charming and friendly with them during the interval but he was rightly disgusted when they disrupted her performance by singing the shows music and waving their sonic screwdrivers
2611937 catherine is a pro so she ignored them but david knew the only way to stop them was by getting up and leaving
2611938 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
2611939 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent
2611940 im of the star wars generation i love science fiction star trek the next generation battlestar galactica love em
2611941 i love every morning getting up to go to work because that little boy inside of me jumps with excitement every time i know im going to fight an alien or shoot a rocket gun or be on a spaceship or be with the doctor or get onto the tardis
2611942 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2611943 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2611944 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2611945 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
2611946 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent

2611952 o jogo seria dif cil de qualquer forma era o l der do campeonato um time que vem arrumado jogando junto h muito tempo e que tem sempre essa proposta de jogo de fechar bem marcar forte e sair no contra ataque
2611953 quando aconteceu o segundo gol eu tive que abrir um pouco mais achei que merec amos arriscar um pouco mais e ca mos naquela armadilha que o gr mio usou durante todo o campeonato
2611954 faltou um pouco mais de capricho nos cruzamentos na hora de bater para o gol a temos que lembrar que tivemos dois treinamentos t cnicos durante esse tempo no comando do time foram praticamente tr s jogos em uma semana
2611955 a sensa o de tirar um pr dio das costas
2611956 evidente que esses elementos est o dispostos a travar uma guerra violenta e psicol gica contra os jogos ol mpicos
2611957 eles querem que 2008 se converta em um ano de luto para a china
2611958 a sensa o de tirar um pr dio das costas
2611959 fico feliz porque a torcida ajudou at o fim o campeonato muito competitivo est vamos fazendo uma campanha maravilhosa mas de repente come amos a cair espero que o resultado de hoje s bado levante o astral
2611960 ao fim do primeiro turno tivemos aproveitamento de cinq enta e quatro por cento considero bom mas n o o ideal temos de chegar na casa dos sessenta por cento
2611961 n o que eu n o tinha op o mas tinha muitos garotos no banco e entrar nesse tipo de situa o que vivemos meio complicado por isso tive de improvisar
2611962 ele o melhor goleiro do brasil disparado quando a bola vai na rea fico tranq ilo pois podemos confiar nele
2611963 a sensa o de tirar um pr dio das costas
2611964 the rm10 hourly allowance for on call doctors is grossly unfair
2611965 on the other hand our counterparts at the health clinics are being paid rm80 hourly for treating patients with coughs and flu
2611966 we dont have to work long hours and the workload is also not that heavy at health clinics
2611967 being on call is something that all government doctors have to do while working overtime is voluntary you cannot compare working overtime with being on call
2611968 the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
2611969 an emphasis on universal as opposed to race specific programs isnt just good policy
2611970 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
2611971 so many of the disparities that exist in the african american community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and jim crow
2611972 the problems of inner city poverty arise from our failure to face up to an often tragic past
2611973 what about this texture or what happens if i do this or hmmm maybe i should crop it
2611974 na primeira partida contra a china eles jogaram com dez e mesmo assim causaram muitos problemas
2611975 eles trabalham bem o jogo a reo mas tamb m n o deixam a desejar com a bola nos p s
2611976 nas partidas do brasil os jogadores ficam ansiosos em pedir a nossa camisa a de cinco estrelas para levar para os seus pa ses d para ver como ficam felizes como se tivessem ganho um trof u
2611977 sabendo das nossas condi es f sicas e emocionais elas come aram o jogo na base da press o sobre mim superamos a derrota no primeiro set e buscamos for as na base da conversa do olho no olho
2611978 nestes jogos ol mpicos quero ser digna e batalhar para concretizar um sonho que vem amadurecendo ao longo dos ltimos quatro anos todas as pedras no caminho agora ser o de isopor
2611979 china permanece fiel ao princ pio de fazer uma olimp ada ecol gica cient fica e humana
2611980 i have defeated you death all the beautiful arts have defeated you the songs of mesopotamia the obelisks of egypt the carved tombs of the pharaohs on the altar have defeated you and you are vanquished
2611981 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanize and i think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe but now i think that poetry changes only the poet
2611982 infelizmente minha conclus o que ser muito dif cil se n o imposs vel encontrar pontos de coincid ncia suficientes para elaborar uma declara o conjunta
2611983 v rios membros do conselho expressaram firme apoio aos esfor os de media o internacionais particularmente os da organiza o para a seguran a e coopera o na europa osce e da uni o europ ia ue
2611984 quanta gente precisa morrer l para chamarmos isto de um genoc dio

2611986 um conflito que est se descontrolando e o motivo a interven o em massa de for as exteriores
2611987 nos preocupa particularmente que o conflito parece estar se estendendo para al m da oss tia do sul at a abkh zia
2611988 essa vota o obrigar a um reencontro das autoridades uma reconcilia o do povo boliviano por isso importante a participa o de todos

2611990 yo creo que no vamos a poder dar entrevistas porque se est n empujando mucho y tengo un poquito de miedo
2611991 aqu estoy para apoyar a mi hija definitivamente aqu nunca hay problemas somos una familia muy amorosa
2611992 continuamente ella se mete en problemas pero es muy honesta se preocupa y es muy perceptiva cuando se trata de manejar asuntos de otras personas
2611993 me tiene m s que feliz este lbum me he involucrado de lleno en las composiciones la gran mayor a de las piezas son de mi autor a
2611994 son dos grandes artistas que admiro y espero que se pueda hacer algo con ellos que ser a m s bien un tr o en alguna canci n ser a un honor compartir alg n tema con estos exponentes de la m sica he tenido acercamientos con ellos y espero que se pueda hacer algo

2611998 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2611999 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2612000 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2612001 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2612002 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2612003 now nothing which they imagine to do will be impossible for them
2612004 shall i hide from abraham what i am about to do
2612005 for i have chosen him so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the lord by doing righteousness and justice so that the lord may bring upon abraham what he has spoken about him
2612006 truly i say to you if you have faith and do not doubt you will not only do what was done to the fig tree but even if you say to this mountain be taken up and cast into the sea it will happen
2612007 i do not ask on behalf of these alone but for those also who believe in me through their word
2612008 the glory which you have given me i have given to them
2612009 today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as when they provoked me
2612010 for there is no good tree which produces bad fruit nor on the other hand a bad tree which produces good fruit
2612011 for each tree is known by its own fruit for men do not gather figs from thorns nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush
2612012 the good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart
2612013 why do you call me lord lord and do not do what i say
2612014 everyone who comes to me and hears my words and acts on them i will show you whom he is like
2612015 for your sake we are being put to death all day long we were considered as sheep to be slaughtered
2612016 truly i say to you whoever says to this mountain be taken up and cast into the sea and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says is going to happen it will be granted him
2612017 therefore i say to you all things for which you pray and ask believe that you have received them and they will be granted you
2612018 whenever you stand praying forgive if you have anything against anyone so that your father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions
2612019 shall i hide from abraham what i am about to do

2612038 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2612039 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being

2612059 her bodys not in great shape she is somebody who helped raise me and shes the last person of the generation ahead of me whos still with us so it means a lot
2612060 i know that the folks here in hawaii are especially hard hit because everything has to come into hawaii and gas prices have gone up the roof fuel prices have gone through the roof and its time that you got some real relief and that means actually starting to have an energy policy in this country that makes sense
2612061 weve been divided for so long weve been arguing for so long a lot of times about things that arent even worth arguing about and ignoring the things that we should be doing to make the next generation have a better life
2612062 but they also deserve a civilian leadership that understands that the most important thing we can do to make ourselves safe is to fight the right wars to finish the job in afghanistan and start bringing this war in iraq to a close start bringing our troops out and when they come home to treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve no more homeless vets no more begging for disability payments
2612063 were going to fight every inch of the way because change is hard
2612064 energy independence will require an all hands on deck effort from america effort from our scientists and entrepreneurs from businesses and from every american citizen all of us will need to buy more fuel efficient cars and find ways to improve efficiency we can do this because we are americans we do the improbable

2612080 virtually all of my research and continued study show that our treasured national parks have suffered from political interference and profiteering power and are being reduced to commercialized popcorn playgrounds
2612081 stegner was certainly being dramatic but he was not far off the mark
2612082 the parks are undergoing gradual physical decline due to lack of proper funding the maintenance backlog throughout the nps is officially between 5 and 8 billion these figures are at least two years old so the correct figure might even be higher
2612083 how will the nps catch up with an overall budget of 2 4 billion
2612084 one might correctly observe that the national parks are not being overtly destroyed but there certainly exists a slow growing cancer of benign neglect and misdirected leadership that is eating away at the integrity of the parks every year
2612085 voicing a fairly common concern about parks in those days
2612086 it is particularly important to have people like wallace stegner his son page dr roderick nash joe sax etc speak out because they have great credibility and people listen to them
2612087 if they find their criticisms credible they apply pressure to their elected officials for corrective action that is the way it has worked for a long time
2612088 it is only recently that this cycle seems to have broken down a bit the victim i believe of the overly partisan nature of our national dialog now
2612089 what passes for environmental debate now is for the most part shrill posturing with little active listening being done by either side of the debate its pretty depressing
2612090 any clear vision for the national parks for the 21st century must uphold their reputation in the worldwide realm of parks and protected areas that is both challenge and responsibility as president john f kennedy recognized
2612091 in welcoming delegates to the first world conference on national parks held in yellowstone national park in 1962 kennedy declared

2612097 mr wickett is that rarely heard from but best of all possible reviewers the dedicated and knowledgeable fan he writes clean cutting and fresh reviews that represent a sensibility unspoiled by over exposure to the biz of books but deeply in love with them
2612098 dan wickett is serious about a good read but the ewn email list doesnt just deliver his sure footed reviews it also brings you news and connectiosn to other writers sign up now he understands what readers want to know about books
2612099 dan wickett is a readers best friend not only does he read and trenchantly review new work but he looks back to books that deserve ongoing readership ive lost track of the number of times hes led me to boks that i overlooked or never knew about and that were a delight there arent many reviewers i will let shape my library but dan wickett is one
2612100 the second time was worst than the first both because he already knew how it would feel and because of how much thicker an elbow is than a wrist still he managed it left handed despite borcherts pistol trained at his head first he carefully tournequeted the upper arm and then brought the cleaver down hard chopping all the way through on the first try and then he thrust the stump against the burner the stump sizzled and smoked his vision starting to go he shook his head and took two steps toward borchert and then collapsed

2612110 i think greg is probably the guy that is most confident with the offense right now
2612111 he is the guy that probably at this point in time can do the best job of executing the offense
2612112 they all have shown at some point in time that they have some of the critical factors that you look at for the position of quarterback
2612113 in football sometimes you get injuries and theres nothing you can do about it
2612114 were hopefully that we wont have a lot of those issues this year and we can stay healthy

2612134 rock has to go through fire to become a diamond
2612135 oh you have no idea when you are being whipped so ask what you want and your wish will be granted
2612136 well i mean its just that i wasnt expecting you
2612137 man if id known it was going to be today i would have i dont know skipped work or something
2612138 id tell you but it would kind of ruin the surprise
2612139 but i just thought of it jeanines got to be crushed
2612140 how long before she forgets me you know gets on with someone else
2612141 i would know exactly what you were going to say
2612142 well are you going to show me my life and what went wrong with it
2612143 well i dont know just the thing to do i guess
2612144 so you could learn from it and change in the future
2612145 guess theres not much point in that then is there
2612146 besides you were a shoe salesmen you know what you did wrong
2612147 well can i know what happens afterwards to me well my body i mean just out of curiosity
2612148 well jeanine i mean do you know when shes going to die
2612149 life is a series of never ending moments even the slightest change can affect entire lifetimes of consequences the moment i figured out for her death could change based on a myriad of things as simple as someone forgetting to tie their shoes
2612150 no thats idiotic a butterfly flapping its wings is not going to affect plate tectonics
2612151 time is ever changing i would have to know every change and shift in existence and every possible outcome to be able to pinpoint someones exact time of death and then categorize all of them its limitless
2612152 most of you have already figured that out by now
2612153 well no i do know but it would be impossible to explain
2612154 just thinking about comprehending that kind of continuous looping information cant translate into thought let alone speech
2612155 jeanine must be angry at me for dying especially since she was right
2612156 i mean she was always telling me not to eat so much junk food but i kept getting those breakfast sandwiches
2612157 jeanines like that always nagging first and caring later thinks she knows everything and if shes wrong shell never admit it
2612158 i mean in the afterlife or whatever thought everyone looked like adonises or whatever never see a fat angel on the teevee
2612159 well if itll make you feel better you wont weigh much after your body decays and hardly anything at all if they cremate you
2612160 jeanine was always trying to get me on a health kick
2612161 even tried to make healthy food look like junk like artichoke heart pastries
2612162 i dont really have a preference on occasion i even have a passing interest in dogs
2612163 they never tell you the right size try on fifteen pairs and only buy one if that and then dont get me started on the ones that actually max out their credit cards buying five hundred dollar pieces of string on a board just because its got a name brand on it
2612164 i get my shoes at the sports stores cheaper even without a discount
2612165 im dead and talking about shoes i should have skipped work today
2612166 now that would be horrible i die in a dumb move and the girl dies too that would be
2612167 wait does that mean shes just sitting in a hospital somewhere waiting to die or
2612168 do i have to go through my i cant predict without your brain exploding speech again
2612169 although that would bring a whole new meaning to till death do us part
2612170 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2612171 never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world
2612172 who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies
2612173 a lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes
2612174 what does love look like it has the hands to help others it has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy it has eyes to see misery and want it has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men that is what love looks like
2612175 everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content
2612176 i have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts there can be no more hurt only more love
2612177 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2612178 a study 1975 1989 showed that portfolios that finished the first five years in the top quintile were actually the least likely to finish in the top half over the next five years
2612179 of the 50 top performing funds in 2000 not a single one appeard on the list in either 1999 or 1998
2612180 using past performance numbers as a method for choosing mutual funds is such a lousy idea that mutual fund companies are required by law to tell you it is a lousy idea
2612181 the enemy of a good plan is the search for a perfect plan
2612182 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2612183 they all give a damn and they want to find a way out of this nightmare
2612184 kym worthy was very very very clear that she was not prepared to negotiate with any of the persons in the room that those conversations would only take place both legally and ethically with the legal representatives of the mayor
2612185 but she was prepared to listen to what the gathered group had to say
2612186 essentially what the group had to say was madame prosecutor you have the opportunity to end this if you will hold yourself open to whatever possibilities that the mayors legal representatives present to bring this particular chapter to a close
2612187 and while it is not your responsibility and while this was not a crisis of your creation it is indeed an opportunity that you have been presented with to free this city of all of the difficulty this current crisis has caused
2612188 we want to create a solution that furthers the cause of justice
2612189 and that demonstrates the absolute respect for the rule of law while at the same time recognizing the already tremendous price paid by all of the participants in this episode
2612190 there have been plenty of meetings among business leaders its at the top of the agenda lets face it these are business leaders invested in the city and they want it to reach its fruition
2612191 some say its stalled some say the spiral is going the other way
2612192 she was the perfect example of what one would want an elected official to be in a circumstance where there were difficult conversations to be had
2612193 i think that everyone in the room made a significant contribution and i do think quite frankly that if you had called me on wednesday and said conrad how do you think it went i would say it went magnificently
2612194 hes a friend and its hard when friends get in trouble when pete said hes the best mayor weve had in 24 years he meant it
2612195 liberals and conservatives blacks whites religious all trying and hoping we can get there
2612196 i know what they talked about most was how to get out of this the best way we can because right now no one is looking for a win win to use the old pr speak
2612197 lets be honest the city council stuff is going to take many months
2612198 we have a legal process that has already started and will kick into high gear next month its all everybody talks about
2612199 to explore the promise and potential of stem cell research without crossing a fundamental moral line
2612200 i got more clothes than him bless his heart when his dad died he had to go get a suit

2612203 i think its fair to say the greens will be significantly more receptive than they have been the first two and a half days
2612204 i cant believe it i have a chance its great to be here
2612205 a recent study of several nutritional supplements showed that subjects who took a daily pill containing luceen had significantly better vision of distant objects than subjects in the study who took other nutritional supplements luceen appears naturally in a tasty fruit that grows on the island of bonopia and very few inhabitants of that island wear eyeglasses or other corrective lenses such evidence suggests that people who develop vision problems should take regular luceen supplements
2612206 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2612207 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that
2612208 they will be times that we hope they can be out by they will be based on conditions on the ground not according to hard deadlines
2612209 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2612210 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2612211 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2612212 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2612213 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2612214 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it

2612227 i will climb back up to the upper platform and jump again because i am no pussy and i am determined to make this jump
2612228 why am i in here did craig knock me out and rape me
2612229 no man apparently you had fallen at work and broke your knee rather badly
2612230 so then your saying that craig definitely didnt rape me
2612231 pretty good for a guy who just realized he wasnt corn holed
2612232 well good coz i have some potentially upsetting knews for you
2612233 your not gonna tell me that i really was ass jamed by craig are you
2612234 no as it turns out you require an expensive operation and though you have medical insurance through your job apparently you have to pay a 1000 deductible before the insurance will even pony up the rest of the cash
2612235 well i can get that kind of cash no problem i started saving up pennies a few months back and im quite sure i have at least a thousand dollars in there by now
2612236 well i went to your house to find anything of value so that i could cash it in for money
2612237 i cant believe you did that just so i could get this operation your a good friend
2612238 ahhh yeah i did it so you could get the operation
2612239 well thats not important right now whats important is that your alright
2612240 i dont get paid to have sex with guys i get paid to blow them i let them fuck me for free
2612241 but if i get this operation i can be normal again and wont have to worry about this horrid pain every time i stand
2612242 oh sorry i was just thinking about my new car and my new surround sound sterio i recently bought
2612243 speaking of those things where did you get the money to buy them
2612244 i got the perfect idea on how you can get the 1000
2612245 i dont think so but what i was going to say was you could fake your death
2612246 i had a dog once that was good at playing dead but it wasnt so great at playing hide the banana
2612247 but you could fake your death and collect the insurance money and then pay the 1000 to get your knee fixed

2612251 i think a lot parents know their children are protected but fail to realize there are other strains
2612252 this disease is spread through saliva like sucking on the same water bottle as one of your teammates
2612253 there are a lot decisions that go into a publicly funded program and there are only so many health care dollars available
2612254 had we known the vaccine was available we would have made private arrangements to have brody covered

2612292 on april 20 2008 holy cross evangelical lutheran church in newmarket ontario voted to issue a call to a candidate who has not been approved for ordination through the candidacy processes of the evangelical lutheran church in canada
2612293 since that time i understand that many of our rostered personnel have been invited to attend an irregular service of ordination and to participate in it by vesting for the service and or participating in the rite of laying on of hands
2612294 after much soul searching and considered reflection i have come to the conclusion that any rostered person who vests for this service and or participates in a rite of laying on of hands will have chosen to publicly participate in an action that our church prohibits and as such would be subject to subsequent disciplinary action
2612295 as noted in my april 30 2008 letter to holy cross congregation i am committed to working toward ending practices that preclude the full participation of all gods people in the life of the church regardless of sexual orientation
2612296 however when viewed from a wider perspective i believe that this action requires participants to abandon several foundational and confessional principles which inform our churchs understanding of ecclesiastical polity and the role identity and functioning its rostered leaders
2612297 our individual belief in the justness of any individual cause does not in itself justify the use of any and all means to achieve a particular end
2612298 i hope and pray that you can receive this counsel from your bishop as also coming from a colleague who is not insensitive to the significant dilemma this situation presents for many of you may god grant each of us generous gifts of wisdom and insight in this present moment

2612330 the california catholic conference of bishops must express its disappointment in the california supreme court decision to declare proposition 22 unconstitutional
2612331 proposition 22 which states only marriage between one man and one woman is valid and recognized in california passed eight years ago by a vote of 61
2612332 catholic teaching maintains that marriage is a faithful exclusive and lifelong union between one man and one woman joined in an intimate partnership of life and love a union instituted by god for the mutual fulfillment of the husband and wife as well as for the procreation and education of children
2612333 partnerships of committed same sex individuals are already legal in california
2612334 although we strongly disagree with the ruling we ask our catholic people as well as all the people of california to continue to uphold the dignity of every person to acknowledge individual rights and responsibilities and to maintain support for the unique and irreplaceable role of traditional marriage as an institution which is fundamental to society
2612335 catholic teaching maintains that marriage is a faithful exclusive and lifelong union between one man and one woman joined in an intimate partnership of life and love a union instituted by god for the mutual fulfillment of the husband and wife as well as for the procreation and education of children

2612340 a lutheran sexual ethic looks to the death and resurrection of christ as the source for the values that guide it
2612341 we ground our ethics in the living voice of the gospel

2612344 lutheran historical teachings concerning homosexuality sometimes have been used to tear apart families with gay or lesbian members
2612345 this social statement on human sexuality taps the deep roots of scripture and the lutheran witness
2612346 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
2612347 even at the insurgencys peak we never faced such a grim situation these religious riots are the worst i remember
2612348 theyve driven a wedge between hindus and muslims who were living as brothers
2612349 this is the most polarised situation ive seen in a generation
2612350 by the end of the ritual tears are flowing from many eyes this is not a dead ritual but one which liturgically actualizes the oft preached theme of forgiveness it teaches us that our forgiveness of one another is inextricable from receiving divine forgiveness it forces us to confront forgiveness directly in the form of the brother or sister in front of us rather than merely forgiving them abstractly
2612351 it certainly helped my wife and i to get through our first year together being forced by this self imposed discipline to ask forgiveness of one another every evening robbed each of us of that bitter pleasure of nursing wounds for days on end
2612352 i think it is difficult if not impossible to help someone truly heal into their full human potential without a spiritual context there are times when life is so complex and difficult that only the belief that there is a greater understanding or power that can be found pulls us through
2612353 forgiveness for me is the radical acceptance of what was said or done and of who you are and who i am it means accepting the person who is responsible for the words or deed that hurt me as a human being who makes mistakes
2612354 forgiveness is letting go of what keeps me stuck in the past so that it cant continue affecting my current life its how you allow your heart to be opened again not about forgetting or even about being in a relationship with the person resentment contaminates current experience and its only felt by the person who harbors it forgiveness is about healing yourself
2612355 the most egregious thing religion teaches us is that were not ok that were born with original sin that needs to be forgiven that goes right to the heart of christianity
2612356 i believe in my heart that were all doing the best we can when i got that and that it was true even with my mother and father and we all have wounds there dont we that they didnt set out to destroy my self esteem that they were doing the best they could at the time i could forgive them and take responsibility for my life
2612357 when i forgive im not saying i never got hurt but im not going to wallow in it for three weeks the way i used to it requires seeing the offense as a human mistake and not taking it personally it doesnt require a reconciliation of the relationship either if you can have that its golden but it requires a certain detachment usually and the ability to see the other person as a human who makes mistakes
2612358 involve the higher concepts of living and include forgiveness non judgment gratitude compassion manifestation and others the natural way of being in the universe
2612359 to me forgiveness is freedom freedom from negative thoughts and emotions whirling around within your being
2612360 one thing i keep in mind when approaching the act of forgiveness is that all people are doing the best they can within their frame of reference and abilities when we realize that our parents teachers or whoever else we may be carrying around with us did the best they could with the tools they had at the time it becomes easier to allow and forgive to let go of the past and move forward
2612361 what someone else does is not truly about us rather it is about their own life circumstances when we look at the big picture with compassion and understanding we do not have a need to take things personally it is a time to ask ourselves why does this affect me in a negative way what am i afraid of the experience becomes an opportunity to learn something about ourselves it offers an opportunity to move forward on our spiritual path
2612362 carrying a grudge is detrimental to your emotional and physical well being it blocks your energy flow often times it is self forgiveness that offers the most healing
2612363 forgiveness of others is a release from our own self indulgence does that sound odd think about it any continuing resentment i have against another person for some real or imagined offense i have felt at his or her hands keeps me linked to that event or person in a negative way its like being chained to the person im resentful of the sooner i forgive that person the sooner i am unchained its freedom in the best sense of the word
2612364 often as difficult as being reconciled with others and with god
2612365 we all recognize that forgiveness is a gift given and received but it is also an empowerment to forgive

2612378 internet filtering has been on the rise in asia for the past five years says john palfrey executive director of harvard universitys berkman center for internet amp society
2612379 it matters because it highlights the tension between the desire to grow the economy with the desire to control political speech
2612380 internet filtering is an attempt to make the internet function much as traditional media have yet where the state can serve as a gatekeeper over what is said and by whom palfrey says
2612381 netizens in china are helping to highlight corruption and abuses of power the phenomenon has taken some government officials by shock and thats a good thing
2612382 depends on specifically how they are deployed by and with whom and how transparently and openly that deployment happens says rebecca mackinnon a media professor at the university of hong kong and a widely read blogger
2612383 despite the growth in internet filtering in asia the long term prospects for censorship on the web are not great palfrey says
2612384 citizens in asia among other parts of the world like the middle east have often demonstrated their ingenuity when it comes to evading censorship online

2612412 in the lead up to the election we are well aware that a changed social and political landscape could be on its way
2612413 we want to make sure aged care is high on the priority list whatever the outcome
2612414 we need to be realistic about how we are going to fund aged care now and in the future and how to balance the expectations of funders providers and consumers
2612415 the government will not be able to sustain present funding levels for all new zealanders forever its imperative we agree on a demand and supply equation before we run out of beds
2612416 we also need to talk about who is going to bear the cost of care and about the need for a strategy to deal with chronic caregiver and nurse shortages
2612417 there was a general belief that moving forward with a challenge and establishing a precedent in channeling regulation would serve the country better than leaving the challenge to the next administration
2612418 the chief of staffs office then appears to have changed its mind
2612419 today typifies the climate change schizophrenia in the bush administration on one hand government scientists are saying that global warming poses grave threats to our health and our welfare and on the other hand there are white house political hacks following the oil industrys bidding to do nothing
2612420 its going to be hotter its going to be hotter sooner in the year than it was in the past
2612421 theyre going to look back and think back about how nice the summers used to be

2612423 climate change is a serious problem that our nation needs to address but we need to address it correctly
2612424 we were told that the document should not establish a path forward or a framework for regulation but should emphasize the complexity of the challenge
2612425 steve johnson as he has said repeatedly and in sworn testimony made his own decision

2612449 terraforming mars by increasing its mass may defeat much of its commerial and industrial value because mars has less mass and less gravity than earth it is easier to build a space elevator on mars allowing mars to be developed as a staging area and mined for the purpose of building spacecraft and spacestations in order to travel to other star systems the testing of space elevator technolgy on mars may also be an intermediate step for building a space elevator on earth either way increasing the mass of mars at present would be self defeating if our end goal is merely to create earth like habitable land for settlement our efforts may be more well spent at desert land reclamation on earth

2612473 the first candidate with a comprehensive education plan is john edwards no surprise there and no surprise that the proposals are excellent
2612474 edwards is staying ahead of the pack when it comes to thinking about education h e remains the most intelligent candidate in the field when talking about how to improve school
2612475 north carolina senator john edwards moved the debate forward in a useful way endorsing a plan to focus integration efforts on income rather than race

2612478 during one of the darkest eras in our history a group of courageous americans both black and white as well as free and enslaved struggled together to form what would be known as the underground railroad
2612479 this racially integrated movement to bring about social change has familiar heroes such as harriet tubman william still john rankin and susan b anthony but there are thousands more who risked their lives to help others escape the clutches of slavery as they fled to the north
2612480 this important effort will educate citizens across the country and around the world about the underground railroad movement in america
2612481 this legislation will ensure a strong public private partnership exists to supplement and leverage federal resources along with funds collected at the state and local level

2612505 internet filtering has been on the rise in asia for the past five years says john palfrey executive director of harvard universitys berkman center for internet amp society
2612506 it matters because it highlights the tension between the desire to grow the economy with the desire to control political speech
2612507 internet filtering is an attempt to make the internet function much as traditional media have yet where the state can serve as a gatekeeper over what is said and by whom palfrey says
2612508 netizens in china are helping to highlight corruption and abuses of power the phenomenon has taken some government officials by shock and thats a good thing
2612509 depends on specifically how they are deployed by and with whom and how transparently and openly that deployment happens says rebecca mackinnon a media professor at the university of hong kong and a widely read blogger
2612510 despite the growth in internet filtering in asia the long term prospects for censorship on the web are not great palfrey says
2612511 citizens in asia among other parts of the world like the middle east have often demonstrated their ingenuity when it comes to evading censorship online

2612532 local military sources confirmed the incident and said the military forces have been put on alert
2612533 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2612534 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2612535 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2612536 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people

2612538 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2612539 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others

2612542 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2612543 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a cease fire
2612544 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on nonuse of force with south ossetians
2612545 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2612546 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia
2612547 regrettably i have come to the conclusion it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground in the council on a draft statement to the press
2612548 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia

2612572 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2612573 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2612574 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2612575 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2612577 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2612578 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2612579 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2612580 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2612581 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2612582 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2612583 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2612584 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2612585 people who are very well meaning still ring up reporting sightings of craig looking as though he would as a nine year old boy
2612586 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2612587 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2612588 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2612589 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2612590 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2612591 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2612592 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

2612594 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

2612601 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2612602 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2612603 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2612604 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2612605 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2612606 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2612607 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2612608 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2612609 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2612610 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2612611 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2612612 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2612613 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2612614 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2612615 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2612616 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2612617 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2612618 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2612619 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2612620 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2612621 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2612622 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2612623 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2612624 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2612625 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2612626 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2612627 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2612628 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2612629 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2612630 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2612631 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2612632 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2612633 mayo underwood was the best school in the world we learned and just had fun
2612634 i think its nice that people came to mingle together

2612637 we didnt have a bus we didnt know what a bus was
2612638 every time we have a reunion i never miss it
2612639 we didnt have the equipment in schools but theres something about that unity that isnt in the schools today
2612640 progress is good but integration hurt us a little bit
2612641 we lost a lot of our good teachers only one went to frankfort high and she became a librarian
2612642 whos going to tell people about our heritage unless we do it ourselves
2612643 thats why we brought rosenwald in here cause theyre younger
2612644 i spoke to them for 15 minutes and i urged them to stop the forum as it is a form of provocation against muslims
2612645 there can be civil disorder and disturbance to the peace and we cant ensure their safety
2612646 if we were to take action nobody will be safe here
2612647 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2612648 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2612649 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2612650 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2612651 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2612652 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2612653 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2612654 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2612655 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2612656 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2612657 beschlussfassung ber die zustimmung zum abschluss eines beherrschungsvertrags mit der omega i s r l luxemburg als obergesellschaft
2612658 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2612659 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2612660 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2612661 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2612662 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2612663 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2612664 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2612665 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

2612667 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2612668 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2612669 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2612670 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2612671 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2612672 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2612673 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2612674 who are open to doing something on the production side
2612675 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2612676 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2612677 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2612678 those days were the freest and happiest of my life
2612679 what will it be like living in this new country
2612680 the picture was titled beans and false perspective a man from california who was a top exec in some company that makes tennis balls and rackets and who knows what other sports equipment seemed to want that picture very badly and would not take no for an answer in spite of the nfs card tucked into the bottom left hand corner of the spare wooden frame he began at six hundred dollars and worked his way to four thousand he said he wanted it for his study i would not let him have it and he went away sorely puzzled even so he didnt give up he left his card in case i changed my mind
2612681 then i happened to show ollie weeks one day last fall he asked me if he could photograph it and run it as an ad one week and that was the end of my own false perspective ollie had recognised the painting for what it was and by doing so he forced me to recognise it too a perfectly good piece of slick commercial art no more and thank god no less

2612686 ive come along way ive dragged my family halfway around the world away from my dad and mum and everybody who needs me back in australia and today it just feels like its worthwhile
2612687 it feels like ive conquered a huge mountain and its just a great day
2612688 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be seen to be the company that is still trying to implement work choices
2612689 in a democracy people who want to be a member of a union then the union has got the right to represent them and companies right across the country should recognise that
2612690 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be trying to squeeze the last bit of bitter lemon out of work choices
2612691 there are no new awas awas cannot be amended so if people want to move to new arrangements they need to move to a new industrial instrument
2612692 i know this has occurred in the context of the olympics and that is of itself very regrettable
2612693 this has been a longstanding dispute there have been tensions between georgia and russia simmering for some time
2612694 were obviously very concerned our starting point is that we respect georgias territorial sovereignty over south ossetia
2612695 we call on all the parties to immediately engage in a ceasefire and we urge all parties to commence the dialogue
2612696 we wont be hauling anyone in well do it in the usual way
2612697 we will express privately as we are publicly our view that we want the parties to cease violence immediately and to resolve the conflict by discussion
2612698 so it wont be a matter of hauling people in it will be a matter of firmly in the usual way making our view known to the parties concerned and the international community
2612699 we think that any use of force any use of arms to resolve disputes is serious and we take it very seriously
2612700 porque yo no tengo donde publicarlas yo no tengo revista
2612701 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position

2612733 when he got to the subject of income disparity between the rich and poor edwards seemed ready to discuss a substantive problem in depth as if he were going to deliver some innovative solution that would restore the vital center of american politics he started out promisingly i think you could ask the american people tomorrow and im talking about people who live in rural north carolina who sometimes vote democratic and sometimes vote republican i think we can convince them tomorrow that every child in america ought to get a first class education and then nothing while packaged as a unique statement delivered by a democrat who managed to win an election in jesse helmss own state edwardss comment scaled the pinnacle of banality if such a thing is possible who among serious americans including the republicans doesnt think students ought to receive the best possible education policy fights involve how best to achieve this not the general principle which was all edwards had to offer
2612734 so all i will say is that you have to get to know me and decide for yourself i will let you be the judge not trying to sound corny or clich but someone i can laugh with cry with and grow with we dont have to agree on everything but find some common ground and have understanding

2612780 telkom kenya is concerned that safaricom is engaging in anti competitive behaviour and in essence abusing its dominant market position by introducing barriers to new entrants targeting sms market segment
2612781 we are perturbed that safaricom having not been involved in the initial tender process is currently able to provide a similar services using the 460 prefix this is a totally unacceptable anti competitive behaviour
2612782 realise they must adopt new technology or fall into oblivion as has happened with some of their competitors
2612783 both newspaper editors report that sales of online and hardcopy issues are growing
2612784 the daily nation is working on a new website nation digital that will include text messages via mobile phones online news chat rooms rss and specialised services such as sports scores stock prices and horoscopes
2612785 most from outside kenya but a steadily increasing number from within the country as internet access penetrates more kenyan businesses schools and households
2612786 computer based index of the articles published in the major nairobi newspapers from 1980 onwards covering the cultural affairs of this country mainly music dance theatre literature and art
2612787 subsequently the topics expanded to include reproductive health law governance affairs and various others
2612788 hundreds if not thousands of newspaper titles from some 29 sub saharan countries have already been microfilmed and dozens more are being filmed on an annual basis by the library and its office in new delhi india
2612789 in spite of this laudable work many more newspaper titles and corresponding issues remain in our ever growing backlog
2612790 one possible role of kenyan librarians would be to encourage the newspaper managers to offer internet access to full content of the articles free to kenyan schools and universities
2612791 could be a role for any national african library association many journal publishers located in the us and europe are now allowing internet users in developing countries to access full content of journal articles without charge
2612792 if this open access could be offered to kenya newspaper readers the information in the daily press could strengthen efforts in governance and democratisation literacy and responsible civic leadership
2612793 kenyans especially those outside nairobi have been waiting eagerly for the real time data but inability to access the internet remains a big challenge
2612794 although it is taking time for many investors to appreciate the value of data we are upbeat that revenue will pick up very soon

2612799 we have read about many so called investors announcing that they will be landing their cables in sa
2612800 its not exactly conducive to creating an environment for investment
2612801 some of our companies have been paying half a billion dollars to do business elsewhere so i am not sure where the constraints for south african companies could be
2612802 because business is now queasy about having to invest so much in infrastructure when they dont know whats going to happen on the continent
2612803 most ict firms however have indicated application of cost leadership strategies resulting in lower arpus with the intention of raking in higher subscriber number
2612804 broadband max 2 offers a quadruple downlink coupled with high reliability evidenced by a 99 8 per cent service level agreement
2612805 we are the only isp offering this sort of solution in the kenyan market and have realised significant increase in demand over the past six months
2612806 internet service providers record rise in earnings in kenya business day
2612807 african media need to attract advertising not just from within but from other countries by involving more into social networking strategies
2612808 readers are accountable for what they write but there is control of content by media companies readers give us feedback via comments and this returns traffic to the sites
2612809 people need to use web 2 0 as an application web 2 0 is growing in africa and a lot of people are using blogging using word press blogger com and they are using them to their best practice
2612810 web 2 0 application is an easier tool to drive the business we should not under estimate our readers because they are very smart we need to think out of the box by taking keen interest in creating local content that can drive the business
2612811 there is so much interaction over the internet with web 2 0 but there is need for more bandwidth hence spending more time and exploring the internet

2612930 russian peacekeepers and military units are carrying out an operation to enforce georgia to a peace deal they are also responsible for defence of the population
2612931 only the russian media and one ukrainian channel have been filming in the breakaway republic no western camera crews have been working in the conflict zone
2612932 there is almost no way we can imagine a return to the status quo
2612933 i dont know that its really as newsworthy as everybodys making it out to be
2612934 but the more he charged them the more zealously they proclaimed it
2612935 the proper focus of illustrations lies in presenting biblical truth in such a manner that it can be understood deeply and applied readily rather than in providing popular enjoyment or pastoral acclaim
2612936 the preacher who constructs sermons to serve illustration rather than solid biblical exposition inevitably drifts from pulpit to stage from pastor to showman
2612937 hes dead the old man now put him in the morgue so he doesnt stink up the joint clean up all the filth that this dead corpse has caused and put to death every remain there is of him
2612938 this woman had suffered much under many physicians and had spent all that she had and was no better but rather grew worse

2612942 all the delights in the sensual life are but as the putrid waters of a corrupt pond where toads lie croaking and spawning compared to the crystal streams of the most pure and pleasant fountain
2612943 take us to court if you want pictures or proof
2612944 to so live and so study and so serve and so preach and so write that jesus christ the crucified and risen god be the only boast of this generation
2612945 it is far easier to study and press a thousand truths upon others than to feel the power of one truth upon our own hearts
2612946 the fact is many of us simply preach sermons not the word of god we preach the exegesis not the divine oracle we preach crafted alliterated manuscripts instead of the living word we are biblical but the word has been deadened by a lifeless delivery or a hampering style
2612947 preaching needs to be constantly adapting itself to the changing face of culture
2612948 we do not have enough jobs in our small community and our kids go away to college and get a job elsewhere
2612949 i do not care about his assistant i want to see the man himself mine is a desperate case but i have heard that this physician has curedthe like i must therefore see him no assistants for me
2612950 he is out but there are his books you can see his books
2612951 i cannot be content with his books i need the living man and nothing less it is to him that i must speak and from him i will receive instructions
2612952 i dare say they are very good but they are of no use to me without the doctor i want their owner to prescribe for me or i shall die of my disease
2612953 here is a person who has been cured by him a man of great experience who has been present at many remarkable operations go into the inquiry room with him and he will tell you all about the mode of cure
2612954 i am much obliged to you but all your talk only makes me long the more to see the doctor i came to see him and i am not going to be put off with anything else i must see the man himself for myself he has made my disease a specialty he knows how to handle my case and i will stay till i see him
2612955 now i rejoice in my sufferings for your sake and in my flesh i am filling up what is lacking in christs afflictions for the sake of his body that is the church

2612988 which is aptly named and very helpful as with most translations from german its not the snappiest read but it is short and should be read by every student of theology whether one enrolled in a university degree or simply discovering the wonders of theology in books
2612989 experientially there is sometimes joy in obeying god but sometimes not jesus expressed loud groans to god when facing death particularly i dont know how the command often expressed by christian hedonists to pursue ones own joy as hard as you can fits in with the command to deny yourself which is key to repentance denying yourself is sometimes not joyful and surely actually means that the heart of christian discipleship is not doing what will bring you most joy but denying yourself that
2612990 yet a little while and the coming one will come and will not delay but my righteous one shall live by faith and if he shrinks back my soul has no pleasure in him

2612992 our preaching combine heart wrenching weeping with unbreakable confidence in the sovereignty of god
2612993 lots of people would like you to not preach the cross non christians find it offensive some christians think it is dull or the basics that they have gone on from and grown out of some think that its just an old message with little contemporary excitement because theyve heard it all before but i tell you that there is no glory in christianity without the cross there is no glorious message for us to proclaim without the cross there is no power to save those who believe no grace no work of the holy spirit galatians 3 says that you grow as a christian having the holy spirit and knowing him working miracles among you because you believe the message of christ crucified and without the message of the cross the gentiles are nor brought as a fragrant offering to god for his praise

2612997 we definitely have the talent and innovation here and there are excellent opportunities for southern california investors to support entrepreneurs in our own backyard however a clear gap exists when it comes to local support of early stage technology companies
2612998 when you break it down almost 10 percent of the vc funded startups in the united states are based here but we only have three percent of the venture capital the gap is made worse by the fact that southern california vcs tend to be later stage investors
2612999 by any measure southern california is a center of innovation we have some of the countrys top universities spending more than 4 billion a year on research and development and there are more patents issued annually in southern california than in almost any other region of this size the angel network groups have done a good job stepping in at the earliest stages of investment but there are very few groups there to back them up with that first institutional round of funding
2613000 from an investors perspective early stage funds have historically delivered the best returns 35 5 over the past 10 years in my view high net worth individuals family offices and southern california based firms should be looking at early stage investing in this region as a very attractive category
2613001 we are exposed to over 1000 new southern california companies annually and a very small fraction of them will find funding we believe we can do better for both entrepreneurs and potential investors
2613002 they are willing to accept the money even though they are beating the biaw up as well
2613003 its a real shame and a stain on my party
2613004 my fellow democrats would cry foul when the biaw levies vicious attacks on our governor and environmentalists and then they hypocritically accept campaign contributions from biaw pacs its no wonder most people are so cynical of politicians you would think that the democratic party would put principle before money but some in my party just cant help themselves
2613005 candidates and members of the legislature make decisions about who they accept donations from the state party would never accept a donation from the biaw because we dont agree with their goals and we dont agree with their values and we dont agree with their message and we have no respect for them
2613006 thats a decision between that candidate and his or her voters
2613007 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness

2613021 above 35 mph there is an external combustion system which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air
2613022 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg
2613023 no ones really proven a six seater passenger car can get any better than 75 miles to the gallon so this would represent a big step forward
2613024 they would have to prove that before they can throw rocks at the prius
2613025 that is above what you normally find even in an industrial setting
2613026 that takes quite a compressor to do it takes horsepower to compress the air up to that pressure

2613032 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2613033 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2613034 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2613035 biobag is proud to be the best selling brand of certified 100 biodegradable high rise composts vermicondo
2613036 these containers are made from natureworks pla a 100 corn based resin that is full compostable
2613037 not now baby i gotta drop some hound dogs at the guitarlet
2613038 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2613039 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2613040 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2613041 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2613042 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2613060 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2613061 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
2613062 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
2613063 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means

2613070 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2613071 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2613072 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2613073 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2613078 well i did not feel i was telling them what to do but rather i gave my opinion on what they should do if they wanted peace
2613079 i and the others i believe call naive anyone who thinks the us places value on these countries

2613114 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2613115 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2613116 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2613117 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
2613118 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2613119 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado
2613120 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a
2613121 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados
2613122 un interlocutor v lido que en este caso ser a o el ministro de gobierno jorge tobares o alg n funcionario de alto rango con poder de decisi n
2613123 queda de manifiesto que se ha atentado a uno de los rewe correspondiente al territorio lafkenche lago budi por la carretera de la costa en la comuna de saavedra
2613124 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo
2613125 dejamos claro que no es tozudez de parte nuestra sino de los que provocan por cuanto anteriormente hab amos invitado a la autoridad comunal y gobierno regional a conversar en el espacio ceremonial rewe weicha el d a s bado 2 de agosto a las 13 00 horas no acudiendo ninguna de las autoridades mencionadas

2613127 it was time to go and the buyout was attractive enough to leave
2613128 so even though id covered the olympics previously i couldnt call the u s committee or the international olympic committee and say i want a credential you need a news organization to back you and news organizations are cutting back on olympics coverage except for the web sites like yahoo and espn they have a lot of credentials these days
2613129 i heard that the richmond va times dispatch had returned its credential to the u s olympic committee saying it couldnt afford to cover the olympics i contacted the times dispatch sports editor and he said he wanted to work something out
2613130 im going to be following corporate sponsors for the sportsbusiness journal and talk about things like the implica tions of someone winning a gold medal endorsements agents and so on
2613131 and im writing more fan oriented columns for sporting news for the christian science monitor ill be writing probably just a couple stories a week which will be more internationally oriented
2613132 this is what i call a one man suicidal news bureau and it will carry my life through the olympics
2613133 after that ill see whats going to happen the period after the buyout is definitely a transitional year and then ill figure out whats going on next
2613134 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2613135 i have a deep faith so i draw from the christian faith
2613136 the problem with his view of sin is its a decidedly non christian view of sin sin is a transgression of gods laws not an individuals values
2613137 h e is confused about what christianity believes which isnt unique because many people who identify themselves as christian are equally confused but second his lack of a moral compass
2613138 im praying for unexpected unanticipated unforcasted rain that starts two minutes before the speech is set to begin would it be wrong to pray for rain
2613139 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2613140 this is my neighborhood and i dont want these things to happen in minneapolis we want to bring this to the attention of as many people as we can
2613141 the primary attacker wore his crew jacket as he monstrously attacked an unarmed man allowing everyone in minneapolis to see what exactly the state was paying for
2613142 moreover we have reason to believe that at least one of these men is already on criminal probation
2613143 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2613144 but okay with a coke i love coke it is a perfectly refreshing drink except for what cane worker in haiti paid with his back for this sugar

2613149 what better way to celebrate the life and works of karl marx than to get totally naked in a staff meeting
2613150 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2613151 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2613152 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year
2613153 i tried everything second seems to be my place what can i say
2613154 ive been tempted for a while especially with this horse to try american racing
2613155 i took the lead because i wanted to run my race
2613156 he quickened when i asked him to so i never saw what was happening behind me
2613157 il y a eu plusieurs explosions ce matin plusieurs endroits de kuga
2613158 he was kidnapped by a beauty queen and forced to have kinky sex with her so whats the problem here exactly
2613159 rented honeymoon cottage well then its no longer fun it becomes creepy
2613160 local military sources confirmed the incident and said the military forces have been put on alert
2613161 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2613162 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year
2613163 i tried everything second seems to be my place what can i say
2613164 you got to go you got to go hes coming
2613165 it was the opportunity to play strategy and i give the total credit to tim cindric

2613170 i want to learn more about data structures and algorithms
2613171 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2613172 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2613173 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2613174 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2613175 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2613176 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2613177 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2613178 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2613179 kalau kamu tidak mau membersihkan kamarmu ayah tidak mau membacakan cerita nanti malam
2613180 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2613181 lamentablemente mi conclusi n es que ser muy dif cil si no imposible encontrar puntos de coincidencia suficientes para elaborar una declaraci n conjunta
2613182 varios miembros del consejo expresaron su firme apoyo a los esfuerzos de mediaci n internacionales particularmente los de la organizaci n para la seguridad y cooperaci n en europa osce y la uni n europea ue
2613183 cu nta gente tiene que morir all para que llamemos a esto un genocidio
2613184 creo que ya no estamos en un punto en el que el consejo de seguridad pueda adoptar un texto importante
2613185 ste es un conflicto que se est descontrolando y el motivo es la intervenci n en masa de fuerzas exteriores
2613186 nos preocupa particularmente que el conflicto parecer estar extendi ndose m s all de osetia del sur hasta abjasia
2613187 two entered yet quietly into hall what else you have there
2613188 sprut 2 in that film some man with berlusconis face killed professor who knows how really died my own grandfather naum

2613190 o k we are supposed to win this one now how
2613191 well lsu really should win i hope it is close cause it will be a really good game for t v
2613192 if you want a cupcake eat a cupcake dont chew on glass and tell yourself it is a cupcake
2613193 pure and blameless religion lies in coming to help orphans and widows
2613194 i am sure this bible made in india and for indians will bring the word of god closer to millions of our people not only christians
2613195 work alone is your proper business never the fruits it may produce
2613196 it will take some time for the new bible to gain acceptance
2613197 people in india are really appreciating it especially the pictures
2613198 i am sure this bible made in india and for indians will bring the word of god closer to millions of our people not only christians
2613199 we wanted to show the parallels between the themes in the bible and in indian religions
2613200 there just cannot be a dialogue or genuine peace between christians and hindus unless we stop proselytization
2613201 this does not mean that someone who has witnessed christian work say at a charity institution wants to find out more about jesus and the church should be discouraged but denigrating another religion and insisting that there is only way to salvation is not a good thing at all
2613202 we continue to be appalled by the action of many fundamentalist christian preachers and aids organisation that sought to exploit the tremendous tsunami tragedy in many asian cities and towns
2613203 the missionaries were telling the people that unless they became christians they would not get the relief aid
2613204 the indian style mass is being celebrated in many christian ashrams in india
2613205 we want to see a gandhi pilgrimage center in a temple where christians could go and meditate
2613206 i will continue that practice should i become prime minister
2613207 new zealanders are generous people and john key is a good example of that
2613208 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2613209 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2613210 if you were banished forever from minnesota but had time to grab a book or two which ones would you take to help you remember the place you love
2613211 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2613212 itry using a little vulcan logic to move it in the right direction
2613213 what if the fcc comes to regulate the internet as might begin to happen should they be given the right to enforce net neutrality policies
2613214 you forgot to mention that the times and other large papers forgot or dismissed the small business owner
2613215 the governments theory would impose criminal penalties for violating a websites terms of service something millions of internet users do every day often without even knowing it
2613216 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be seen to be the company that is still trying to implement work choices
2613217 in a democracy people who want to be a member of a union then the union has got the right to represent them and companies right across the country should recognise that
2613218 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be trying to squeeze the last bit of bitter lemon out of work choices
2613219 there are no new awas awas cannot be amended so if people want to move to new arrangements they need to move to a new industrial instrument
2613220 i think the lesson lies to some degree elsewhere it lies in the method of the campaigning the style of the campaigning and the appeal to the electorate and i think we certainly need to look at the early election that was certainly a disturbing factor
2613221 at this stage its very much too close to call
2613222 were obviously down to the wire im not conceding and im certainly not giving up the fact that i could win so well just have to wait and see
2613223 the conservatives in the northern territory were coming off a very low base i think they had four seats so in many respects the only way was up as far as conservatives in the northern territory are concerned
2613224 georgia launched a major military offensive friday to retake the breakaway province of south ossetia prompting moscow to send tanks into the region in a furious response that threatens to engulf georgia a staunch u s ally and russia in all out war
2613225 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2613226 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2613227 gee i want a lot more of this and a lot less of what weve been watching for the first 90 minutes
2613228 fated episode online to episode brickwall trailer to episode to 12 asian quantcast
2613229 that would last me about more than three months or more

2613231 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2613232 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2613233 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2613234 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2613235 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2613236 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2613237 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2613238 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2613239 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2613240 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2613241 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2613242 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2613243 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2613244 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2613245 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2613246 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2613247 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2613248 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2613249 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2613250 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2613251 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2613252 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2613253 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2613254 hey im quarter finnish my grandma is a full blooded finn she spoke finnish and everything

2613262 when she goes to sleep at night in her crib she coos at the ceiling she must be talking to an angel
2613263 hmmm lets see here when i changed his diaper the image or elvis or jesus show up in his poop he must be trying to tell us something from beyond
2613264 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome
2613265 mira mi ni a los hombres solo lo que quieren es acostarse contigo
2613266 mira hijo las mujeres son interesadas con dinero hasta baila el perro

2613268 mi ex novio alberto me dijo que por l no hab a problema que aunque tuviera novio yo pod amos seguirnos viendo tener intimidad
2613269 many who come across the border are workers but among them are people coming to kill you and me and your children
2613270 gt a recent interview nevins cited a carnegie endowment for international peace study which found that
2613271 where do these people go well they might try to go to mexican cities but the promise of nafta to greatly increase industrialization in mexico never materialized to the extent it materialized anywhere it was in the border regions but it didnt materialize sufficiently and at the same time of course many of these maquiladoras the factories are moving to china so they end up coming to places like new york city oakland california or rural areas of wisconsin
2613272 when i was out with my friend jim someone thrown a t o m a t o at him
2613273 siamo arrivati troppo presto ieri gli abbiamo telefonato da casa e gli abbiamo detto ke saremmo arrivati x le 13 00 arriver a momenti

2613276 i will be doing a red carpet look that still reflects the simple classic design of the lauren conrad collection but with a black tie twist
2613277 on high and i doubt that you need to point out her moves to her own boyfriend
2613278 our goal was to encourage people to rethink the way our streets are used and to temporarily expand the amount of public open space in an underserved area of downtown san francisco
2613279 we added 24 000 square foot minutes of public open space that afternoon
2613280 turning parking spaces into instant parks national park ing day is a creative way to demonstrate the real need to create more parks in our cities
2613281 across america cities are renewing their investments in parks because our civic leaders have come to recognize that close to home parks gardens and playgrounds are essential if we are to have cities that arent just livable but lovable

2613417 theres a couple of areas where late in games he has missed shots on goal but thats because of how he has worked to try to rally the team
2613418 theres a couple of areas where we turned the ball over that made it too easy for sydney to have an easy passage towards goal and of course they had goodes and hall up the other end who were finishing off
2613419 it was a couple of poise things and we made the wrong decisions when we got the ball and we paid the penalty

2613438 greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends
2613439 as he was praying the appearance of his face changed and his clothes became as a flash of lightning

2613470 could probably write for months solely about bad things apps do and what we had to do to get them to work again often in spite of themselves which is why i get particularly furious when people accuse microsoft of maliciously breaking applications during os upgrades if any application failed to run on windows 95 i took it as a personal failure

2613476 that i said i would retire if we beat the u s team was a joke i just wanted to clarify how difficult it is to win them
2613477 we felt it was the best thing that could happen for us

2613523 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

2613531 both for example were fastidious very attentive to hygiene and the condition of their fingernails
2613532 vague yet oddly stimulating these titles increase the suspense all the more i found myself speed reading this book section by section so i could find out what happened next
2613533 taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2613534 i didnt know anything about it but i thought it was pretty cool
2613535 after i read that i was one of the favorites i felt a little jolt of pressure
2613536 i had to remind myself to take things one step at a time
2613537 im just as excited about this time but i think it will be less startling than athens
2613538 the olympics are something you train for all your life it seems almost like a dream when youre there its hard to take in everything but im going to try and see it all again
2613539 i hope to find time to take a cooking class while im there

2613541 i was playing baseball but was kind of dissatisfied with it
2613542 a coach said to come down and try fencing i was looking for something else i wasnt very good but i had a lot of fun what kid doesnt like to play with swords
2613543 i had three days of instruction but as the event approached i suddenly got incredibly nervous
2613544 they gave me a pep talk and once we got going it flowed pretty well
2613545 it was a heck of an experience in athens but this time im going to live the experience as an athlete
2613546 ive been working for this for 20 years and theyre not going to rip off a single second from me my goal since i was 4 years old was to be an olympic athlete
2613547 if i have a solid shoot a solid fence a top five swim a top five ride and win the run that probably could win a medal
2613548 if i did that and if it didnt win a medal i could hang my hat on it id know that i competed at the best of my ability my biggest competition is myself olympic competition has a reputation for making great athletes suddenly collapse
2613549 the pan am region is one of the weaker in the sport
2613550 im more confident with my fence im a sporadic fencer and people dont like to face me because im completely unpredictable
2613551 i need to win the run and i should win the run
2613552 its a chase start and the order is based on the performances in the previous events
2613553 but you also want to lie down and listen to a relaxation tape you have to squeeze 20 minutes of recovery time out of what you have

2613555 while purported evidence for the supposed reality of sasquatch continues to attract strong criticism more interesting in my view is that a number of academically qualified primatologists have recently gone on record in stating that the evidence for sasquatch is scientifically compelling
2613556 many experts in field x find the evidence for y compelling

2613575 there is no reason why stepfathers cannot make incredibly good parents and they may be more attentive
2613576 but i think you have to look at it case by case
2613577 stepfathers have to work harder to fit in and to have a useful productive role
2613578 for about the last 20 years the conventional view for policy makers in washington is that any activity in the arctic and antarctic is basically related to science
2613579 i expect that sometime in the near future there will be an issuance of what they call a national security presidential directive to lay out new policy in the arctic
2613580 this will deal with more issues of sovereignty security presence and things like that the question is what do we want to project up here
2613581 the primary mission right now is the maritime boundary line with russia keeping foreigners from stealing alaskan fish

2613593 two finger scrolling there are lots of ways to use it in final cut pro
2613594 if the management of the games goes well i think it will have a positive effect on chinas global diplomacy and confidence of the government it will probably make them more receptive to international cooperation and multilateralism
2613595 conversely if the government receives a lot of negative media coverage and the games are mismanaged or there is an incident it will only fuel the more xenophobic and less cooperative elements in the chinese government
2613596 it will spread over to the world and become an international nightmare because china will feel humiliated and this will add to that suffering
2613597 china will feel very defensive about the human rights issue and if anything it will start paying more attention to this issue and why this issue has attracted so much criticism from the rest of the world
2613598 the greatest potential change in chinas international situation may not be its orientation to the world but the worlds orientation to it

2613606 ive got a hundred candles and lots of copper candlesticks with ornamental handles they cost me every cent i had but i shall be all right and in the darkness of the eve ill have a splendid light
2613607 yes you may be wise but then again praps not only pence had i to buy one candles all i got but then i bought some matches too and you the silly goose bought none and so without a light your candles are no use
2613608 i think the lesson lies to some degree elsewhere it lies in the method of the campaigning the style of the campaigning and the appeal to the electorate and i think we certainly need to look at the early election that was certainly a disturbing factor
2613609 at this stage its very much too close to call
2613610 were obviously down to the wire im not conceding and im certainly not giving up the fact that i could win so well just have to wait and see
2613611 the conservatives in the northern territory were coming off a very low base i think they had four seats so in many respects the only way was up as far as conservatives in the northern territory are concerned

2613617 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2613618 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2613619 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2613620 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2613621 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2613622 this has been a difficult week and a half for us
2613623 we lost our family dogs we did it at the hands of sheriffs deputies who burst through our front door rifles blazing
2613624 i heard gunfire shoot off there was a brief pause and more gunfire
2613625 i didnt sign up for this fight but i think what we have to do now is make changes to how prince georges county police and prince georges county sheriffs department operate

2613628 he was one of the kids that could do anything he put his mind to
2613629 joe just was able to set a goal and reach it
2613630 he really did love everything that he did in his life he was just that kind of person thats for sure
2613631 but he just knew what he was going to do with his life see the world and serve others thats what he wanted
2613632 he was active in little league and all the things boys do
2613633 in high school he played ball and was a good wrestler
2613634 soon after they enlisted they were both offered the opportunity to be a part of honor guard joe decided to make the move his brother didnt
2613635 he also protected former president george bush we saw him on television with him
2613636 many will remember his extraordinary skills in seeing tribunal staff through difficult performance issues to explain in the clearest possible manner the sometime muddy un rules and regulations and to always lend his ear to colleagues joe was at the right place in his heart and mind we are still trying to cope with this enormous loss
2613637 those blessed to work with mr myers through his service as executive director of omega and president of the eoda will always be encouraged by remembering the fiery way he championed the needs of our communities in the government halls of washington d c
2613638 his advocacy garnered countless financial investments to support appalachias progress in meeting basic needs such as gaining the infrastructures necessary to quality of life and economic progress
2613639 it is really the torch that don carried that we want to keep bright
2613640 remembering mr myers passionate concern for basic often over looked needs will always serve as a source of refreshment for our own individual commitments to make a difference with the opportunities we have been given
2613641 while we celebrate the significant difference made by such a very special person we also realize many basic needs remain and the potential to make a difference through regional partnership and learning is endless
2613642 i sincerely believe the donald r myers legacy fund is a meaningful way for all of us to join together in this regard to make a significant difference today and through the power of endowment far beyond our life spans
2613643 we wouldnt be able to enjoy the freedom we have today or the armed forces we have today if it werent for them we owe him much
2613644 im still proud to have been able to serve in world war ii and to do what i could to keep this great nation free

2613670 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2613671 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2613672 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2613673 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2613674 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2613675 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2613676 when these plans for ohare were first being put together oil was nowhere near 50 a barrel let alone 100
2613677 airlines are challenged right now and we at ohare want them to be able to get back on their feet
2613678 but for them to add more profitable routes they need more runways here ohare hasnt added a new runway since 1971
2613679 making ohare more efficient is an incredibly important move for aviation infrastructure
2613680 its a challenge for chicago to finish ohare but they have to press ahead they have to be successful
2613681 these arent the most important buildings in ohio by any means but collectively the wright field historic district is very important and these buildings are part of that
2613682 the only way to clean up the contamination which is under the slab of the building is to take the building down and dig out the contamination
2613683 its not my job i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2613684 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2613685 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2613686 they want a place where we can eat somali food and just to be
2613687 after a couple of weeks we get together to eat and talk
2613688 they are nice and they teach me how to do my work
2613689 theres nothing specific or different about the somali workers that i note
2613690 this is a town thats home to 26 nationalities we never bothered to do the statistics or research ourselves but generally speaking weve always had many different people from many different backgrounds
2613691 the right people who could appreciate and enjoy this type of work
2613692 they kind of mingle among themselves and they dont bother anybody
2613693 some of them have left because they dont like slaughterhouses but a lot of them have decided to stay for now
2613694 but we all need to make sure this is long term so far so good we came here because they were hiring quickly and i stay here as long as i can keep my hours
2613695 his feet dangling and within reach the men and boys played with the corpse by swinging it back and forth against the building to hear the dull thud
2613696 it wasnt in mississippi it was in illinois that jarred people
2613697 add the fact that its where lincoln is buried you have a lot of symbolism lincoln was a live memory to a lot of people
2613698 i found it hypocritical that in this town its all about lincoln we want to embrace him then you find out whoah this is who we are this is springfield
2613699 all day and all night long he had a gun on each shoulder and he marched from where our store was to our home and that was back and forth all evening
2613700 its a history that has to be brought out into the open it really has to be
2613701 it is extremely important that we take time to recognize the significance of the race riots that we teach our children all about them
2613702 and that we rededicate ourselves to the notion that we must all work together to ensure that something like that never happens again
2613703 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
2613704 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
2613705 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native
2613706 in my mind were not really pushing any environmental laws or rules its just a natural thing very natural to the farm were not shooting guns
2613707 you might move them from one blueberry patch to another you might even move them out of the area
2613708 but falcons are a scare tactic and we always want to use an integrated approach we want to have a whole tool bag full of methods any and all methods that are effective and safe and i view falconry as one method that could have some use
2613709 theres a relationship between what the prosecution spends and what the defense needs
2613710 prosecutors could have proceeded with one or two counts ten witnesses could prove that case
2613711 i was doing my job and i would do the same things again
2613712 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2613713 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all
2613714 figment of the tabloid press i dont want that garbage in with the puppy story
2613715 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2613716 we go to church and serve the lord and try to lead good lives and do good things
2613717 she is a person of note in our little community
2613718 a child has to know where he comes from he needs to know what this country is about
2613719 theyre angry theyre wondering why they have gotten into their teen years without learning about it
2613720 theyre shocked at what humans beings do to each other
2613721 white americans in the north pretty much thought violence against blacks was a southern thing the springfield riot really came as a bolt of lightning to northern newspaper readers
2613722 the question was if it can happen in springfield maybe it can happen anywhere
2613723 this was the right thing to do theres no question in my mind
2613724 they turned it into tourism dollars this horror that occurred in their hometown
2613725 this would be like seeing a shirt that had the towers falling on 9 11 people making money off the tragedy that everyone had to endure
2613726 the negroes would come to the window and rush back they didnt dare come out for fear theyd get shot they went back in and anybody that i knew or talked to said there were negroes in there that were burned up
2613727 its a funny thing i can understand why few people want to talk you can see right away that youre accused of participation just by assumption
2613728 deb and i are out for good i wish you and the fort the best of luck
2613729 i think they found that trying to play a close hand role in ticonderoga from wyoming or a house in the south of france or on a yacht in the middle of the atlantic ocean was very very difficult
2613730 its a moment of truth for this city people are participating new yorkers are united with their city
2613731 will become as much a part of the new york experience as strolling the coney island boardwalk participating in the five borough bike tour or listening to the philharmonic in the park
2613732 thats a lie i never threatened anybody with lawsuits i saw what i believed to be a civil rights violation
2613733 based on my training there was no probable cause for them to search that trunk
2613734 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2613735 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2613736 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2613737 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture
2613738 i suspect after youve had numerous busts somebodys future plan for growing pot in vineyards is going to be thwarted
2613739 mrs toguchi prayers are nice and its probably very helpful but you still need chemotherapy
2613740 dear lord youre the one who created my body so i know you can fix it
2613741 i put my whole faith in you father damien please pray for me too because i need your help
2613742 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2613743 the point here is that the primary tumor was treated
2613744 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2613745 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true skeptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer
2613746 im not the praying type but i just wanted to say thank you
2613747 the most difficult and painful cases to me are unresolved cases involving children
2613748 i was 16 i had a dream that my uncle was going to have a heart attack and it came true
2613749 i have been involved with some 500 homicide cases over the years
2613750 how do you deal with the naysayers or skeptics when you are working on a case
2613751 i think its healthy but i know my work and for those who do not it doesnt bother me almost every case will have one non believer they are always intrigued even if they do not believe
2613752 i have been working with law enforcement agencies for 32 years as time has passed more and more agencies have been receptive to my work
2613753 it is a credit to an agency to use the services of someone in this line of work who is reputable as it helps the family in many ways most importantly in resolving the case
2613754 a precious and meaningful way not only to explain death to children but also helps adults deal compassionately with their own grief over the loss of a loved one
2613755 if anyone wants to know my opinion he only has to click for it
2613756 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2613757 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2613758 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2613759 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2613760 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2613761 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2613762 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2613763 when speaking to about 600 donors at a chicago hotel mac joked that he did not understand why obama would want to run for president
2613764 people like rumors they are going to say things like you know you was in the club with lil kim and you and kanye west got in a fist fight
2613765 my great friend one of the kings of comedy bernie mac

2613792 it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the olympic games the georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in south ossetia
2613793 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2613810 i often feel as if i am transporting the entire jerry springer audience from a to b
2613811 i have fought against white domination and i have fought against black domination i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities it is an ideal which i hope to live for and to achieve but if needs be it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die
2613812 we take mandela as a second jesus christ who was jailed for all of us we really appreciate the sacrifice that he made we all fought together as brothers and sisters and it is more hurt ful when it is our own brothers who are now oppressing us
2613813 the un world food programme wfp office in yemen has said food price hikes have increased the number of people living below a us 2 a day poverty line and hampered achievement of the millennium development goals mdgs
2613814 it is very difficult to give an up to date figure the situation is certainly worse than what was mentioned three months ago not only because of food price rises but also drought especially in rural areas we need to have assessments done to find out what the real situation is on the ground
2613815 the crisis is very serious there are no magic solutions to this problem
2613816 the problem is not the availability of food but how many people have access to food a familys whole budget no longer enables them to meet their food requirements i am talking about a big proportion of the population who live on less than 2 a day
2613817 the pattern of food consumption has changed people in the highlands did not eat rice preferring millet corn and barley to prepare bread now soft wheat is preferred instead
2613818 there will be a big catastrophe as hunger will spread
2613819 this bold and innovative partnership between feed projects and whole foods market will make a real difference
2613820 hundreds of thousands of rwandan children who might have gone to school hungry will now go nourished and ready to learn
2613821 the downfall of the bigger cars was that they were forced to stop so often so while they kept overtaking us we eventually went past them at the next petrol station when they needed to fill up again
2613822 we kept at a decent speed and still averaged around 35 miles per gallon
2613823 having entered for fun and to raise money for the nspcc its fair to say that we were surprised to win and i suppose there is a david and goliath element to our victory
2613824 i think the other drivers initially thought it was a hoax that a smart had entered but they gave us more and more credit as the week went on and at the end they were genuinely pleased that we won
2613825 whilst i think ive converted quite a few of them to the merits of smart ownership the event has just strengthened my admiration for the car
2613826 the ride and economy are outstanding you can park it anywhere and there is room for my golf clubs its just a great little car
2613827 it all comes back to the problem of power there is huge energy poverty in the world and that energy poverty causes more pollution

2613833 when it comes to fighting aids our greatest mistake may have been to overlook the fact that in spite of everything african people often know best how to solve their own problems
2613834 everyone seems to know what africa needs but sometimes i think our minds are not really on it
2613835 most of us see only africas contours and we use them to map out problems of our own africa is a career move an adventure an experiment it fades into an idea we arent really looking
2613836 i am often asked whether there will ever be a cure for h i v aids and my answer is that there is already a cure
2613837 it lies in the strength of women families and communities who support and empower each other to break the silence around aids and take control of their sexual lives
2613838 tend to have several long term relationships over a lifetime
2613839 it was as though i had been written out of history
2613840 the stories of children who travel alone in southern africa tell of beatings at the hands of the authorities of their possessions being taken of forced labour and their vulnerability to sexual abuse
2613841 released by sc uk and sc norway in mozambique the children highlight the dangers they face when crossing borders alone
2613842 many were very clear about how they should be helped by governments in the region and how they should be treated with respect
2613843 a number of children called for the authorities to stop abusing imprisoning and repatriating them to their home countries while others said they should be entitled to free education in the host countries
2613844 we jumped over the first fence and the second one which is electrified and has razor wire and cement posts then we will be moving though the forest so you might be attacked by lions and other wild animals we met two soldiers and they shot more than six bullets into the sky
2613845 these are the voices of real children and they are saying clearly that we must do more to protect them unaccompanied child migrants are extremely vulnerable to abuse and exploitation but this is an issue which has slipped through the cracks of public concern in southern africa and around the world
2613846 do you use two pieces of bread to make a grilled cheese
2613847 members of reporters without borders today broadcast radio without borders chinas only independent fm radio station in beijing just hours before the start of the olympic games opening ceremony in a programme lasting 20 minutes reporters without borders secretary general robert menard and chinese human rights activists called on the chinese government to respect free speech the programme in english french and mandarin was heard in on 104 4 fm in different districts of the chinese capital
2613848 its hard to tell whether any beijing residents were actually listening the wall street journal called stations in the city including beijing radio central radio and china radio international to see if they noticed this hijacking of the airwaves it turns out that none of these stations broadcast on the 104 4 fm frequency so would any listeners have been tuned into that frequency this morning

2613855 the place they said was used to train suicide bombers is in fact a flour mill
2613856 we were all traders here and now our means of earning a living is gone
2613857 the onus is now on the government whether they hold to their word or remain in the alliance with the us
2613858 we do not want to fight pakistan or the army but if they continue to be slaves to us demands then we our hands will be forced

2613865 language like consciousness only arises from the need the necessity of intercourse with other humans
2613866 spanish colonialism westernized the filipino principally through religion american colonialism superimposed its own brand of westernization initially through the imposition of english and the american school system which opened the way for other westernizing agencies
2613867 taught them to regard american culture as superior to any other and american society as the model par excellence for philippine society
2613868 the american revolutionary nation built its original ideals on a double repression that of the extermination of the amerindian natives and that of the difference between free white men and black slaves the linguistic community inherited from the anglo saxon country did not pose a problem at least apparently until hispanic immigration conferred upon it the significance of class symbol and racial feature
2613869 the social inequalities inherited from slavery and reinforced by the economic exploitation of the blacks
2613870 the individual creates his or her own language behavior so that it resembles that of the group or groups with which he wishes to be identified to the extent that he can identify the groups observe and analyze such groups is motivated to adapt his behavior and is still able to adapt his behavior by so doing the individual is thus able to locate himself in the multi dimensional space defined by such groups in terms of factors such as sex age social class occupation and other parameters for social group membership including ethnicity
2613871 such solidarity did not happen to the pilipino americans because they are pilipinos who are in america as their parents and grandparents were but rather because they are americans who are pilipinos
2613872 this suggests that most filipinos who have been naturalized citizens filipinos have a 45 naturalization rate the highest among asian groups and who can speak english well still prefer to speak their native language at home
2613873 a fear of cultural change and a deep seated worry that european americans will be displaced from their dominant position in american life
2613874 intimate and sure relations between the ruling groups and the popular masses that is the reorganization of cultural hegemony 1971 16
2613875 represent a concession to nativist instincts and are incompatible with the cultural diversity and ethnic pluralism that constitute fundamental strengths of our nation we are a tapestry of many races creeds religions and ethnic backgrounds each independent but all interwoven with one another the glue that bonds these diverse communities together is not commonality of language but a commitment to the democratic ideals on which our country was founded

2613879 whoever does not recognize and champion the equality of nations and languages and does not fight against all national oppression or inequality is not a marxist he is not even a democrat for different nations to live together in peace and freedom or to separate and form different states if that is more convenient for them a full democracy upheld by the working class is essential no privileges for any nation or any one language such are the principles of working class democracy

2613887 sabemos y las nuevas pruebas lo confirman una vez m s que la mejor manera de hacer menos necesario un aborto es ayudar en primer lugar a las mujeres a evitar embarazos no deseados
2613888 y sabemos que el primer paso crucial para hacer que el aborto sea seguro es legalizar el procedimiento asegurar que es realizado por personas cualificadas y en las mejores condiciones posibles es hora de que los responsables de formular pol ticas en todo el mundo renueven sus compromisos con la salud de las mujeres y afronten estos asuntos cruciales

2613917 but my mother who was a simple housewife she showed me the snake when i was a child
2613918 how dare this man come in here and name a snake after his wife
2613919 it gives the impression that people here depend on people from abroad to come and show us things in our own backyard
2613920 probably people have overreacted its nationalism going a bit awry
2613921 what we really want to protect is the natural phenomenon of abundance
2613922 if we wait until migrating animals are endangered then we lose both the ecosystem benefits associated with their abundance and also the wonder and majesty of migration
2613923 all you see in the view of your binocular is just one dragonfly after another zooming through your field of vision
2613924 vultures go between palestine and israel and syria and lebanon storks and cranes do the same thing
2613925 implies a need for a more extensive reserve system and more constraints on blocking developments than someone focused mainly on resident species and breeding habitats might have envisaged
2613926 its easy to envision a situation where you have a choice between conserving an important stopover habitat or growing food or biofuel on it
2613927 you have to alert people and after a while the public knows about it and they do something about it thats when the big changes will come about i think theres absolute hope
2613928 indigenous peoples are among the first to suffer from increasingly harsh and erratic weather conditions and a generalised lack of empowerment to claim goods and services
2613929 defending the recovery of ancestral lands the self determination of indigenous peoples and their human rights is at the core of their claims
2613930 victims whom i have met with continue to complain of headaches skin lesions nose throat and lung problems as well as digestive problems
2613931 i am very concerned about the situation especially for women who have complained of an increase in premature births early menopause and miscarriages since the dumping occurred
2613932 the people of abidjan need urgent assistance after two years they continue to live in precarious conditions and their right to a healthy and safe environment continues to be violated
2613933 some of the victims i met are the most vulnerable without enough money to eat let alone pay for expensive medical bills
2613934 i hope to be able to get a more comprehensive view of what happened and ascertain responsibility
2613935 this is to send a signal to other transnational corporations and individuals that such crimes will not go unpunished and that africa is not a cheap dumping ground
2613936 there are huge swathes of it and it is very toxic and potentially very dangerous
2613937 it is catered for under the weeds act 1959 and landowners have to remove it if it becomes a problem i always used to pull it up and take it away but there is so much now it is not really worth it
2613938 ragwort is a native part of our ecosystems and directly supports more than 40 other species in addition it is an important nectar source helping to sustain what is left of our natural pollination services
2613939 there is a lot of emotive hyperbole about the dangers of ragwort and this should be viewed with a discerning eye it would be a tragedy if it is pulled out of the ground wherever it is seen
2613940 ragwort although a threat to livestock has an important role to play in the biodiversity of our countryside
2613941 insects absolutely love it and it can happily exist in areas set aside for nature conservation as long as these areas are not next door to grazing animals especially horses
2613942 it is a hugely difficult species to control and neither the technology nor the resources currently exist to control it effectively
2613943 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2613944 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2613945 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2613946 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2613947 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2613948 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2613949 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2613950 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2613974 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone

2613998 i am not a secret agenda kind of politician never have been never will be
2613999 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2614000 if it was maintained and we were successful in pulling that data off it it might yield such things as the speed of the vehicle at the time of the collision and whether the driver was applying the accelerator or was applying the brakes

2614004 ice cream worth shouting about and eating in the cold
2614005 revelation of the day was the transcendently smooth intensely flavored and perfectly balanced ice cream from the bent spoon
2614006 i had never heard a word about the ice cream at the bent spoon until i came across it at the tail end of an outdoor event in a freezing rain this is ice cream good enough to forget inclement weather
2614007 taking the ice cream sandwich to the next level the bent spoon uses one miniature croissant on either side of their delicious ice cream
2614008 the whole buy and hold idea is about to explode in everyones face you cant tell me that buying and holding ge forever is a good idea anymore

2614044 ich wusste nur dass er etwas langsamer war und habe alles gegeben

2614047 non dire nulla lo interruppe fatima si ama perch si ama non c altra ragione per amare
2614048 ti amo perch tutto luniverso ha cospirato affinch io giungessi fino a te
2614049 sono una donna del deserto disse lei ma prima di tutto sono una donna
2614050 perch non riuscirai mai a farlo stare zitto e per quanto tu finga di non ascoltare ci che dice sar sempre nel tuo petto e continuer a ripetere quello che pensa della vita e del mondo
2614051 il tradimento il colpo che non ti aspetti e se tu saprai conoscere bene il tuo cuore esso non te lo dar mai perch conoscerai i tuoi sogni e i tuoi desideri e saprai fronteggiarli nessuno riesce a sfuggire al proprio cuore quindi meglio ascoltare ci che dice perch non si abbatta mai quel colpo che non ti aspetti
2614052 anche se ogni tanto mi lamento diceva il suo cuore lo faccio perch sono il cuore di un uomo e i cuori degli uomini sono cos hanno paura di realizzare i sogni pi grandi perch pensano di non meritarlo o di non riuscire a raggiungerli noi i cuori siamo terrorizzati al solo pensiero di amori che sono finiti per sempre di momenti che avrebbero potuto essere belli e non lo sono stati di tesori che avrebbero potuto essere scoperti e sono rimasti per sempre nascosti nella sabbia perch quando ci accade noi ne soffriamo intensamente
2614053 digli che la paura di soffrire assai peggiore della stessa sofferenza e che nessun cuore ha mai provato sofferenza quando ha inseguito i proprio sogni perch ogni momento di ricerca un momento di incontro con dio e con leternit
2614054 per dimostrarti una semplice legge del mondo quando abbiamo davanti agli occhi dei grandi tesori non ce ne accorgiamo mai e sai perch perch gli uomini non credono nei tesori

2614064 ive been waiting for this to happen ever since they the vampires came out of the coffin two years ago
2614065 do you know how many people are having sex with vampires these days
2614066 i read in hustler that everybody should have sex with a vampire before they die
2614067 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
2614068 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it

2614072 there are really two key parts to being well prepared psychologically and the first is knowing what those factors are
2614073 they need to know what they need to attend to what they need to think of what they need to focus on
2614074 athletes at this level know what these factors are but the key part is that they can manage themselves physiologically to allow that to happen
2614075 there is so much hype leading up to the olympics there are medal expectations and you cant block it all off completely
2614076 some people really handle the spotlight well and others dont
2614077 a sign of a true champion is one that excels when the lights are the strongest
2614078 when everyones rooting for you and you still do well that shows some very very strong mental will
2614079 the race is in his hands that takes a huge pressure off
2614080 ill go out there and give it 100 per cent but if i come third or tenth or if i trip and fall its in his hands
2614081 when im having fun thats when i race the best
2614082 its something we discussed to see if it was a good idea or not for him to carry the flag and of course he wanted to do that
2614083 so then we created a plan about how to manage that effectively its really thinking about how to be a professional going into the games
2614084 i think the pressure of competing in the olympics has always been the same but theres way more media now watching the olympics so theres probably more pressure from that perspective
2614085 they are competing against the some of the best players in the world are running the same distance
2614086 we remind them their opponents are just as nervous as they are
2614087 often well have meetings the night before to go over and remind them of what they want to be thinking of and the kind of emotional level they want to have
2614088 during the competition i have them write in their journals everyday their thoughts how they felt
2614089 its important so that they can understand all of their highs and lows
2614090 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2614091 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2614092 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2614093 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2614094 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2614095 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2614096 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2614097 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2614098 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2614099 jamie was a workhorse back then such a student of the game
2614100 this isnt a surprise to me at all hes still pitching and i think he can go until hes 50 he keeps himself in great shape and with the things he does
2614101 john said that huh well its something thats five years away
2614102 right now im going pretty well and i feel pretty good trying to take things one step at a time
2614103 ill be 46 next year and i will be back next year i enjoy the national league and im swinging the bat well well im swinging the bat well in batting practice i do intend to play next year and i feel pretty good not as good as i did the first day of spring training but i dont think anyone here feels the way they did the first day of spring training
2614104 im not going to rule it out if im still able to be effective
2614105 i have an obligation here that i plan on upholding next year with the phillies so i will be back at 46 hey 50 is five years away its not something im ruling out
2614106 i definitely wanted to come in here and give them a game
2614107 i think hes also been out there enough now that hes regained his delivery and sharpness like braden looper yesterday that was an outstanding performance
2614108 my changeup its the best ive felt with that pitch in the last three starts all year
2614109 two of the biggest things that happened was that zero in that first inning and the double play
2614110 when that leadoff guy gets on they score a lot retire the third and fourth hitter and get that zero and that double play was big
2614111 i didnt want to get too nasty on him because he gave me all fastballs so i gave him all fastballs
2614112 he pitched good today shoulders he did a good job
2614113 podr a firmarse el domingo despu s de que los l deres se re nan y solucionen los problemas restantes
2614114 our franchise has a diverse group of players and were excited to celebrate them
2614115 theyre carrying the torch theres a long history of these different cultures making an impact in baseball
2614116 but of the fans and everybody that has had an impact on the tigers and major league baseball
2614117 it was like the explosion of an atomic bomb emotions of anger and pain
2614118 im at a bit of a loss to know how to address it i dont think that i crossed any lines about writing fictional things about a living person i got most of my stuff off the internet
2614119 ive had to search for small victories every single day i feel my experiences over the last 11 months have been so rich and taught me so much about myself about the strength that i have
2614120 it was phenomenal to be out there competing today because i know i worked my tail off to earn my spot on the team
2614121 kyles floor should have been a 15 8 at least
2614122 and he gets what 15 5 this is crazy it must be some kind of game i am very unhappy
2614123 i dont want to say too much at the moment but im just proud of my teammates unfortunately i wasnt able to come out and do what i wanted but these guys pulled together and they were awesome
2614124 we were so focused on doing the team competition that we didnt really have time to think about what could happen after with the qualification in different things as individuals
2614125 the world university games is the highest level of competition outside the world championships and the olympics
2614126 edouards attitude is that you dont go to the olympics just to participate
2614127 we knew we were going to do well but we never imagined that going out there and doing our routines would put us in the top five in the qualification round
2614128 we were all a little shocked and giddy when we looked up at the scoreboard
2614129 in a sense that eleventh place finish in germany was more impressive than the sixth place finish in denmark
2614130 we qualified without two of our strongest competitors many teams could not have done that
2614131 i dont even think about him not being ready in my mind hes there
2614132 kyle shewfelt at even 70 or 80 per cent is a huge help to our team
2614133 theres a chance he may not be at 100 per cent in beijing we have to face that fact but hell find a way around it im confident of that hes a fighter
2614134 the six starters have shown they can make world cup finals so on a good day they could make the olympic finals
2614135 we have a very balanced and experienced team and we all know how to nail our routines when the pressure is on

2614137 its going to be like college again playing 36 holes in a day
2614138 i think its fair to say the greens will be significantly more receptive than they have been the first two and a half days
2614139 i cant believe it i have a chance its great to be here

2614143 there was no significant loss of life in those towers not a one
2614144 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
2614145 in that building existed little more than a bunch of companies which
2614146 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
2614147 there was no significant loss of life in those towers their own evil
2614148 upon the conclusion of our investigation the big ten is secure in its belief that these games were not compromised
2614149 x is our cleanup guy as well as jhonny has done in xs absence
2614150 hitting cleanup was a great learning experience for jhonny and now hes just got to make the mental adjustment to being back in the 5th 6th spot in the lineup
2614151 home plate looked to be about 120 feet away when i came in the game
2614152 i was as nervous as i was when i made my big league debut but after i threw the first strike it seemed just like another game
2614153 little evidence that coffee and or caffeine in typical dosages increases the risk

2614156 last year we were able to hold a roster spot open for gary as he attempted to make a monumental comeback after he underwent a knee scope last week we are unfortunately not in a position to hold a roster spot this year we are releasing gary today in hopes he will be able to continue his rehab and get back into the nfl either with another team or possibly with the browns gary has made tremendous strides thus far and we believe he can play professional football again in the future
2614157 i want to prove myself lets be honest im not coming off the greatest year in my career so this is a great opportunity for me
2614158 being captain its my obligation to get this team to the playoffs i plan on making this team a contender every single year and i think we are putting the right guys together to do that

2614171 theyve always been on the right side of social justice
2614172 standing with people who didnt have a voice who didnt have a process in the vineyards that is thinking and reflecting our way to a position
2614173 we are asking them to live up to that proud legacy and treat their workers the same way they wanted farmworkers and immigrants treated
2614174 when it comes to their own workers they just believe they know whats best for them
2614175 its classic paternalism they think of themselves as good people on the side of righteousness and for their workers to question that is hard

2614202 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2614203 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2614204 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2614205 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2614206 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2614210 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2614211 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2614212 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2614229 well its for us to discuss if we will do this or maybe no
2614230 promote international cooperation in the fields of library services to children and young adults
2614231 sound directions digital preservation and access for global audio heritage
2614232 we will ramp up production and digitally preserve as much of our threatened cultural heritage as possible
2614233 this is part of our recorded history we have recorded history of many groups and events from around the world that arent replicated elsewhere if we dont take active steps to preserve this material it will go away
2614234 the body of work we have selected for this next phase focuses on the two greatest collections of the archives of traditional music native north america and africa while also including collections from latin america the caribbean asia europe and the middle east
2614235 at the archives of traditional music we are responsible for the stewardship of a vast array of very important and unique recorded heritage from around the world
2614236 we have something in every recorded format ever used in field recording some of those formats are relatively stable and still need attention paid to them but they are not in danger of their contents going away very soon on the other hand other recording formats are quite in danger they are actively deteriorating in our vaults as we speak and must be rescued very soon
2614237 people want to be able to get as close as possible to the original recording to experience it
2614238 because we are an archive we cant provide them with access to the original recording but we can provide them with information that helps them understand more deeply the recording and its original format and condition
2614239 we did that intentionally so we could really get passionate singers
2614240 we had already been in the process of forming a jewish a cappella group anyway
2614241 there is a different kind of passion that goes into it
2614242 there is a different kind of feeling when youre singing with jewish singers and there is a shared culture it makes it extra special
2614243 music and judaism are two things that have been a very important part of my life i love that i get to share these passions with people who may not know them the way that i do
2614244 a sense of urgency surrounds the preservation of these videos not only because of how quickly the source tape deteriorates but as scholars begin using tapeless video recording technologies the need for coherent archival and access strategies is even more critical
2614245 because ethnomusicologists are often documenting cultural practices that do not otherwise get documented the video recordings and the expert descriptions that accompany them are priceless
2614246 the eventual goal will be to repatriate these materials back to countries where they were collected
2614247 in those countries where there is war like liberia where i have done my work if you have an electronic archive it cant be destroyed like physical copies can
2614248 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person

2614250 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2614251 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2614252 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that

2614296 we arrived at the hospital at 2 30 and brody was dead by 5 30 in the morning
2614297 i think a lot parents know their children are protected but fail to realize there are other strains
2614298 this disease is spread through saliva like sucking on the same water bottle as one of your teammates
2614299 there are a lot decisions that go into a publicly funded program and there are only so many health care dollars available
2614300 had we known the vaccine was available we would have made private arrangements to have brody covered
2614301 no other kid in the province should die from this devastating disease
2614302 no other parents should suffer the tragedy that my wife and i have suffered and will likely suffer the rest of our lives

2614306 the eucharistic sacrifice is the source and summit of the whole of the churchs worship and of christian life the faithful participate more fully in the sacrament of thanksgiving propitiation petition and praise not only when they wholeheartedly offer the sacred victim and in it themselves to the father with the priest but also when they receive this same victim sacramentally
2614307 it is my father who gives you the bread from heaven the true bread for the bread of god is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world i am the bread of life he who comes to me will never be hungry he who believes in me will never thirst
2614308 he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me and i in him anyone who eats this bread will live forever
2614309 jesus took some bread and when he had said the blessing he broke it and gave it to his disciples
2614310 the blessing cup that we bless is a communion with the blood of christ and the bread that we break is a communion with the body of christ the fact that there is only one loaf means that though there are many of us we form a single body
2614311 now in christ jesus you that used to be so very far apart from us have been brought very close by the blood of christ for he is the peace between us

2614451 the last lcd monitor we took a look at from asus was the 22 inch pg221 it was one of the most amazing lcds that i have seen and if you are a gamer you would definitely love it one thing that it did lack was a hdmi port this time around asus has sent us their 24 inch mk241 lcd that features full 1080p hd playback via an hdmi port not only that it features 3000 1 contrast ration integrated webcam and asuss splendid video technology lets see how the mk241 measures up
2614452 with a display that can accept 1080p 24fps signals this players picture quality is truly top class detail is astonishing and colours are vivid and lifelike sd dvds dont fare so well compared to a dedicated dvd player with upscaling but theyre still good a bigger issue for multimedia junkies is the lack of media support mp3 wma jpeg and divx files are not compatible the player also lacks resume of a blu ray disc which is annoying if you have stop a movie unexpectedly or change a setting from the menu if you are looking for a reasonably priced entry into the world of high def movies then you could do a lot worse than choose this one at this price its a steal especially for sharp aquos hdtv owners
2614453 since 1987 elitegroup computer systems has been providing motherboards to the masses and now stands as the fourth largest manufacturer in the world i will be taking a look at ecs latest creation the p45t a based on intels fantastic p45 express chipset the motherboard arrived at hardwarelogics west coast lab and immediately demanded attention with its 1333 fsb crossfire support esata 8 channel audio and 16gb of ddr2 capacity and since its from ecs you know its affordable take a few minutes to check out this review as i throw the p45t a motherboard on to my test bench for some serious benchmarking how did it do theres only one way to find out
2614454 what is there to say about the scythe ninja 2 besides the fact that it not only looks good but can perform quite well i was quite surprised when it came down to the testing that the scythe ninja 2 cpu cooler was only beaten by the thermalright ultra 120 extreme scythe has done something quite well with the release of the ninja 2 as it not only performs well but it also runs at relatively silent i was unable to hear the supplied 120mm fan over the my hd4850 stock cooling or over the other fans installed inside of the case i was still disappointed to see that scythe did not include a pwm feature with the fan since the fan is already quiet slowing it down isnt really necessary but a pwm feature would be nice to have as an alert if your cpu fan stops

2614525 you have to understand i have come into a new club where there are a lot of things different to what i am used to
2614526 it takes time to get the place running how i want it to its early days but these things will get sorted out quickly and we will move on i was at blackburn for four years and i knew exactly how things were done the lines of communication what have you
2614527 at the moment its not quite as it was at blackburn every operation is a different operation its a case of understanding that and working with it
2614528 weve had no bids for stephen this time of year people get ahead of themselves and interpret certain things i have spoken to stephen and he is fine with it
2614529 we are working to that end to conclude deals there is not that much of the window left but you can do business right until the last minute and that is what we will try and do
2614530 it was a great goal a fantastic finish and you saw his enthusiasm he is desperate to do well and play well he has got to keep fit and keep well and keep on the field of play if he does that he will be a real impact player for us this season
2614531 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2614532 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2614533 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2614534 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2614535 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2614536 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2614537 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2614538 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2614539 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2614540 did you learn from this and do you ever think you will do it again
2614541 earthquakes may be the result of the earth blackwoman sheding her old less than righteous self by working out issues within her own mind and that the earth will reflect what the sun shines
2614542 i also have heard understandings that earthquakes are from the sun of man allowing comets to strike the earth
2614543 okay guys i fixed her i got my girl back the rest is up to you
2614544 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2614545 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2614546 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2614547 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2614548 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking
2614549 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2614550 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2614551 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2614552 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2614553 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2614554 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2614555 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2614556 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2614557 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2614558 mari kita menemui yauw jie siok aku tak tahu apa ia membeli barang barang yang kupesan
2614559 namanya yauw ceng coen bergelar cian lie toei hong dalam seribu lie mengejar angin tahun yang lalu ayah telah meminta padanya pergi ke tiong goan untuk mengantarkan beberapa rupa barang aku memesan supaya ia membeli yan cie dan puput dari hang cie jarum sulam benang dan gambar gambar lukisan dari souw cioe pit bak contoh contoh huruf dan buku buku aku tak tahu apa ia perhatikan pesanku itu
2614560 ah tin jie toa in jien tuan penolong besar kita nyonya thio ngo ya telah meninggal dunia
2614561 bukanlah sesudah menghilang sepuluh tahun in kong paduka penolong sudah kembali
2614562 kita yang berdiam di tempat jauh sukar mendapat warta sesudah aku tiba di tiong goan baru ku tahu bahwa bahwa tio iajin bersama thio hoejin sudah meninggal dunia pada kita kita empat tahun berselang dengan dengan membunuh diri sendiri aku mendapat warta itu sebelum mendaki boe tong san atku tidak percaya belakangan sudah tiba di boe tong san dan bertemu dengan song toa hiap jie hiap barulah kutahu bahwa warta itu bukan cerita kosong hai
2614563 dengan tegas dan dengan jelas aku minta kau memberitahukan namanya orang orang yang telah naik ke boe tong dan mendesak begitu rupa sehingga in kong terpaksa membunuh diri
2614564 sesudah mendapat tahu tentang kebinasaan in kong sebenarnya aku harus buru buru pulang untuk memberi laporan kepada taoko
2614565 tapi sebab ingin mengetahui nama musuh musuh itu maka aku lalu menyelidiki belakangan ku dengar bahwa di samping tiga pendeta suci dari siauw lim pay jumlah musuh bukan sedikit perlahan lahan aku mengumpulkan keterangan sehingga oleh karenanya aku pulang sangat terlambat
2614566 mereka itu adalah jago jago terutama dalam rimba persilatan dan satupun tak akan dapat ditandingi oleh kita tapi budi thio ngoya berat seperti gunung sehingga biarpun badan kita menjadi tepung kita mesti juga coba membalas sakit hati nyonya
2614567 jiwa kita telah dihidupkan pula oleh thio ngoya dan sesudah itu kita bisa menyambung umur selama belasan tahun adalah sepantasnya saja kalau sekarang kita membuang jiwa demi kepentingan ngoya siauw tee hanya merasa menyesal bahwa siaw tee tidak dapat mencari putera ngoya alangkah baiknya jika kita berhasl mencarinya dan mengajak ia ke sini supaya kita dapat merawatnya seumur hidup
2614568 taoko jinson yang usianya ribuan tahun benar soat lian dari gunung thian san emas hitam pisau dan lain lain barang yang dititipkan toako sudah aku serahkan kepada thio kongcu
2614569 kau boleh menceritakan kepada saudara thio cara bagaimana keluarga kita telah ditolong oleh thio ngoya
2614570 gambar peringatan mengenai pertolongan yang diberikan oleh tuan penolong thio coei san
2614571 karena berada di tempat jauh warta tentang kembalinya thio in kong baru didapat kami pada tahun tahun yang lalu
2614572 kedudukan roh yang angker dari tuan penolong thio thayhiap coei san dan thio hoejin
2614573 saudara kecil bagus thio thayhiap adalah seorang kesatria seorang laki laki jarang tandingan dalam dunia yang lebar ini walupun kau tidak mengenalnya bukan sanak dan bukan kadang tapi memang pantas sekali jika kau mengunjuk hormat kepadanya
2614574 mengapa sekarang jadi cia gie apa cia ya dimaksudkan sebagai ayah angkatku
2614575 setiap orang diberikan uang dan disuruh pulang karena karena rumah ini sangat berbahaya
2614576 saudara thio aku menghargai kau sebagai seorang laki laki sejati dan sebenarnya aku ingin menahan engkau berdiam di sini sampai sembilan atau sepuluh tahun tapi karena terjadinya satu perubahan luar biasa maka kita terpaksa harus segera berpisah saudara thio kumohon kau tidak menjadi kecil hati
2614577 inilah sedikit tanda mata dari kamu bertiga suami istri dan anakku
2614578 coe pehpeh biarpun masih kecil dan tak punya guna siauwtit bukan manusia yang takut mati pada saat keluarga coe pehpeh menghadapi marabahaya biar bagaimanapun jug siauwtit tak akan menyingkir seorang diri walaupun siauwtit tak bisa membantu pehpeh dan ciecie tapi siauwtit ingin hidup atau mati bersama sama kalian
2614579 hai anak kecil memang tidak tahu bahaya sekarang aku terpaksa menceritakan persoalannya kepadamu tetapi kalau lebih dahulu harus bersumpah bahwa kau tak akan membocorkan rahasia ini dan juga kau tidak akan mengajukan pertanyaan apapun jua
2614580 langit menjadi saksi bahwa aku tidak akan membocorkan atau mengajukan pertanyaan mengenai keterangan yang akan diberikan oleh pehpeh jika aku melanggar janji ini biarlah aku binasa dengan badan dicincang laksaan golok badanku hancur dan namaku busuk
2614581 kau hanya boleh mendengar apa yang dikatakan olehku tapi tidak boleh mengajukan pertanyaan sebab tembok ada kupingnya
2614582 orang itu she cia bernama soen bergelar kim mo say ong
2614583 ia bermusuhan hebat dengan banyak partai dan tokoh rimba persilatan bahwa tho inkong suami istri sampai membunuh diri adalah karena tidak mau memberitahukan di mana tempat bersembunyinya saudara angkat itu aku sendiri tak tahu cara bagaimana cia thayhiap akhirnya bisa pulang ke tionggoan dan begitu kembali ia segera mengamuk dan membinasakan banyak orang untuk membalas sakit hatinya thio inkong tapi biar bagaimanapun gagah pun jua satu orang tak akan bisa melawan musuh yang berjumlah besar sehingga akhirnya ia mendapat luka berat
2614584 yauw jie tee adalah seorang yang pintar dan berhati hati ia berhasil menolong cia thayhiap dan membawanya kemari rombongan musuh terus mengejar dan menurut dugaan tak lama lagi mereka akan datang ke sini kami sudah pasti tak akan bisa melawan mereka tapi aku sudah mengambil keputusan untuk membalas budi dan bersedia untuk binasa dalam melindungi cia tayhiap tapi kau sendiri tak punya sangkut paut dengan urusan ini maka dari itu perlu apa kau turut membuang jiwa saudara thio hanya ini saja yang dapat kukatakan sekarang masih ada tempo kau pergilah lekas lekas begitu lekas rombongan musuh tiba batu giok akan hancur dan kau tak akan keburu menyingkir lagi
2614585 sut musuh lihai luar biasa sedikit saja tidak hati hati jiwa cia tayhiap bisa melayang apa kau lupa sumpahmu
2614586 aku sudah bicara seterang terangnya aku menganggap kau sebagai sahabat dan aku telah membuka rahasia hatiku sekarang kau berangkatlah
2614587 sesudah mendengar penuturan coe pehpeh aku lebih lebih tak akan menyingkirkan diri
2614588 harta yang dikumpulkan coe pehpeh dengan susah payah selama bertahun tahun dalam sekejap menjadi tumpukan puing
2614589 dan itu semua demi kepentingan ayah angkat laki laki gagah seperti coe pehpeh sungguh sukar dicari tandingannya di dalam dunia
2614590 adik boe kie adalah kau tahu mengapa hawa di sini terlalu panas dapatkah kau menebak di mana berada kita sekarang
2614591 api sudah padam lama bangsat coe tiang leng pasti sudah kabur ke tempat lain dengan membawa cia soen
2614592 kalau giehoe belum buta dan tidak terluka bangsat cecurut itu tidak dipandang sebelah mata olehnya
2614593 manusia manusia dari siauw lim pay koen loen pay khong tong pay
2614594 mari mari apa kamu kira kim mo say eng cie soen takut kepadamu
2614595 orang yang dinamakan inkong olehmu adalah ayahku sendiri sedang kim mo say ong cia soen adalah ayah angkatku tidak aku tidak bisa salah mengenali
2614596 mata gie hoe buta sebelum mendarat peng hwee to jadi kejadian itu tidak diketahui oleh siapapun dua orang itu menyamar sebagai giehu tapi ia tak tahu kenyataan tersebut
2614597 adik boe kie apa benar kau puteranya tuan penolong kami
2614598 apa kau kira kay pay chioe ouw pa manusia pengecut
2614599 kay pay chiu ouw pa hm kalau begitu kau anggota khong tong pay
2614600 semua partai dalam dunia persilatan sudah tahu bahwa coe tiang leng mau membalas sakit hatinya thio coei san siapa yang turun tangan lebih dulu dia yang menang
2614601 kalau dia benar cia tayhiap biarpun mati kita berdua masih tidak dapat menebus dosa
2614602 bukankah saudara kecil ini sudah memberi keterangan yang cukup jelas
2614603 toako jika kau terus ragu kita tak akan bisa menghindar lagi dari bencana besar
2614604 aku lebih suka mati dicincang ribuan golok daripada mengganggu selembar rambut saudara angkatnya thio in kong
2614605 sebagai seorang yang bergelar kim mo say ong raja singa bulu emas rambut giehoe berwarna kuning tapi orang itu berambut hitam
2614606 saudara kecil kalau orang itu bukan cia tayhiap kita mesti segera membinasakan dia tapi sebelum turun tangan perasaan raguku harus dihilangkan lebih dulu bagaimana pendapatmu apakah pendirianku benar atau salah
2614607 sikap itu adalah karena coe pehpeh menghormati ayah dan giehoe
2614608 tapi orang itu sudah pasti bukan giehoe coe pehpeh kau boleh tidak ragu lagi
2614609 di waktu masih muda aku seringkali diperdayai orang hari ini aku tidak mau balas menyerang sehingga aku mendapat luka berat hal itu terjadi sebab aku salah menilai orang salah boleh sekali tetapi tidak boleh sampai dua kali urusan ini adalah urusan besar soal mati atau hidupku tak menjadi soal biar bagaimanapun juga aku harus melindungi keselamatanmu dan keselamatan cia tayhiap supaya hatiku lega akan tetapi aku tak berani membuka mulut
2614610 coe pehpeh demi kepentingan ayah dan giehoe kau sudah membakar rumah dan harta benda sendiri
2614611 bukan saja begitu tapi coe pehpeh sendiripun sampai mendapat luka berat apakah aku masih harus meragukan kejujuranmu mengenai keadaan giehoe biarpun pehpeh tak menanyakan aku sendiri memang ingin memberitahukan bagaimana kedua orang tuaku bersama cia soen telah diombang ambingkan ombak sehingga mendarat di pulau peng hwee to bagaimana mereka berdiam di pulau itu selama sepuluh tahun dan bagaimana kedua orang tuaku dan cia soen mengangkat saudara tentu saja sebagian kejadian itu tidak dialami olehku sendiri dan aku mendengarnya dari kedua orang tuaku
2614612 inkong inkong sebagai roh yang angker kau tentu mengetahui semua perasaanku selama aku coe tiang leng masih hidup aku pasti akan memelihara dan mendidik saudara boe kie sampai menjadi orang tapi musuh terlalu banyak maka itu aku mohon inkong melindungi
2614613 cia tayhiap berdiam seorang diri di pulau peng hwee to selama beberapa tahun ia tentu merasa sangat kesepian hai cia tayhiap begitu menyintai inkong aku hanya berharap bahwa suatu waktu aku akan bisa bertemu muka dengan dia kalau harapan ini bisa terwujud biarpun mati aku akan mati dengan rela
2614614 coe pehpeh apakah tidak baik kita beramai ramai pergi ke peng hwee to selama di pulau itu aku hidup bahagia tapi begitu pulang ke tiong goan semua lantas saja berubah apa yang disaksikan dan dialami olehku adalah pembunuhan pembunuhan dan peristiwa peristiwa berdarah
2614615 saudara kecil apa benar kau ingin kembali ke peng hwee to
2614616 tidak pantas aku menyeret nyeret seluruh keluarga coe pehpeh ke jalanan yang penuh bahaya
2614617 saudara kecil kau dan aku bukan orang luar kau harus memberitahukan apa yang dipikir olehmu sejujur jujurnya apakah kau berniat kembali ke peng hwee to
2614618 sekarang tidak usah diragukan lagi bahwa orang itu manusia jahat
2614619 tempat persembunyian kita ini sudah diketahui musuh dan kita tak dapat tinggal lebih lama lagi
2614620 apakah tin jie ingin membicarakan sesuatu yang sangat penting denganku
2614621 aha tin jie tentu ingin menjajal kewaspadaan di waktu tidur
2614622 besok waktu akan membuka jalan darahku ia tentu mentertawai aku hmm kalau aku tahu begitu tentu melompat bangun untuk mengagetkannya
2614623 paling baik aku membuka jalan darahku dan menakut nakuti dengan menyamar sebagai setan
2614624 perlu apa aku membalas sekarang tin jie sangat menyayangi aku tapi kalau malam ini aku membalasnya mungkin sekali ia akan berbalik membenci aku
2614625 ya aku mesti tahu diri aku tak lebih dan tak kurang daripada seorang bocah miskin yang tak punya tempat berteduh baik dalam ilmu silat aku berada jauh di bawah wie siang kong di samping itu mereka adalah saudara sepupu dan merupakan pasangan yang cocok yang satu cantik yang satu tampan
2614626 sudah lama kami tidak pernah bertemu dan malam ini kebetulan piauw ko datang anak datang menyusul kemari untuk mengobrol
2614627 anak sudah menotok lima jalan darahnya dan sekarang ia sedang tidur nyenyak
2614628 coe pehpeh juga sudah tahu bahwa aku menyayangi tin cie
2614629 kuatir aku berduka ia tak tahu bahwa biarpun sayang aku tak punya maksud yang lain hai coe pehpeh kau sungguh baik terhadapku
2614630 meskipun begitu kita harus berhati hati supaya ia tak lihat sesuatu yang mencurigakan
2614631 aku ingin bicara dengan gurumu untuk pergi ke peng hwee to kita harus membuat persiapan yang seksama
2614632 kita harus berhati hati supaya ia tak lihat sesuatu yang mencurigakan
2614633 bentuk poan koan pit yang bisa digunakan tia tia mirip dengan pit dan gagangnya sangat pendek
2614634 coe pehpeh begitu sayang aku dan aku tak pantas menduga yang tidak tidak paling baik aku pulang dan tidur kalau dia tahu bahwa aku menguntit dia bisa bisa jiwaku melayang
2614635 orang itu mungkin sekali boe chung coe sebagai seorang sahabat coe pehpeh ini adalah kejadian lumrah di antara sahabat karib mengapa aku jadi begitu ketakutan
2614636 thia bagaimana kalau kita tidak bisa cari pulau itu dan juga tidak bisa pulang kembali
2614637 di dalam dunia ini tanpa berani menempuh kesukaran manusia takkan bisa memperoleh sesuatu yang berharga
2614638 ayahku sering pergi ke tiong goan dan ia pasti tahu racun yang baik
2614639 selama dalam perjalanan kau harus baik terhadap setan kecil itu kau harus menjaga supaya ia tidak tersadar

2614643 coe toako adalah seorang yang welas asih dan perkataanmu itu membuktikan bahwa kau memang seorang ksatria
2614644 kita terpaksa menjalankan tipuan ini karena tak ada lagi jalan yang lebih baik
2614645 boe jie tee sesudah berlayar perahumu harus berada agak jauh dari perahuku kalau terlalu dekat anak itu bisa curiga tapi kalau terlalu jauh hubungan kita bisa terputus maka itu kau harus memilih anak buah dan pengemudi yang pandai
2614646 aku belum pernah memperkenalkan diri tapi bagaimana mereka bisa menebak asal usulku
2614647 ia tahu bahwa kedua orang tuaku lebih suka mati daripada membuka rahasia ia menaksir bahwa jika menggunakan kekerasan ia tak akan bisa mengorek dari mulutku maka itu ia menggunakan siasat membakar rumah sendiri dan menjalankan tipu kouw jiok kee menyakiti diri sendiri sehingga tanpa meminta aku sudah membuka rahasia peng hwee to ah coe tiang leng coe tiang leng tipumu sungguh beracun

2614683 ayah pernah mengatakan bahwa dalam rimba persilatan jarang sekali ada wanita yang mampu menggunakan poan koan pit

2614695 soe ko koe tahu bahwa kau seorang yang mau menang sendiri sehingga ia sengaja mengalah terhadapmu hm tapi kau tergirang girang
2614696 kau kira kami berdua manusia manusia tolol yang tidak mengenal syair

2614703 apa kau bukan manusia boe kouwnio janganlah kau menganggap dirimu sebagai manusia yang terlalu mahal

2614705 kamu begitu menghina aku mana bisa aku memberitahukan nama kedua orang tua ku dan thay soehoe selain begitu akupun belum pernah mempelajari ilmu silat boe kie pay secara sungguh sungguh
2614706 semenjak kecil kedua orang tuaku sudah meninggal dunia dan aku bergelandangan dalam dunia kang ouw aku belum pernah belajar ilmu silat hanya ayah angkatku yang pernah memberi satu dua petunjuk kepadaku mata gi hoe buta sehingga iapun tak tahu apa latihanku benar atau salah

2614721 we havent seen indications or any concrete evidence that iran is building a nuclear weapon and ive been saying that consistently for the last five years
2614722 verification and enforcement of the non proliferation objectives contained in the npt are limited in part to maintain the balance of rights and obligations of states parties npt safeguards administered by the international atomic energy agency iaea are limited to verifying that no nuclear material in each non weapon state has been diverted to weapons or unknown use these safeguards allow for the iaea to report a case of non compliance to the security council only if nuclear material is found to have been diverted
2614723 under a traditional view the authority of the security council is limited to cases which have been found to constitute a threat to international peace and security
2614724 threat to peace breach of peace or act of aggression
2614725 it calls into question the legitimacy of the security council in intruding on matters of enforcing treaty law on matters that do not rise to the level of threat to the peace
2614726 israel will attack iran if it doesnt abandon its nuclear program
2614727 if there wont be a choice other than a nuclear iran or a military option its clear what our decision has to be
2614728 there is no military political or moral justification to initiate war with iran
2614729 all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations
2614730 war is essentially an evil thing its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone but affect the whole world to initiate a war of aggression therefore is not only an international crime it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole

2614766 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2614767 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2614768 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2614769 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2614770 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2614771 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2614772 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2614773 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2614779 its of course completely unacceptable not to reject the death sentence for homosexuals to take up this debate now is important not least of consideration to young homosexual muslim who struggle with their own identity
2614780 there have been enough opportunities for the islamic council to enter the homosexuality debate now its time that the state stand up for some values and remove all financial support from the organization till they distance themselves
2614781 i have noticed that the head of the islamic council himself is against the death sentence for homosexuals this shows theyre going in the right direction i hope that the islamic council therefore acts as an instigator for homosexuals standing in islam and towards the european fatwa council
2614782 i can understand that the homosexuality issue is difficult but i dont accept that the islamic council cant reject the death sentence which conflicts with basic human rights

2614788 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2614789 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2614791 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public

2614856 estas empresas nos han perjudicado enormemente por su abuso de poder y por su abuso contra las peque as y medianas empresas yo represento a 42 empresas a nivel nacional en per entonces ya te puedes imaginar el da o que nos ha causado esta empresa
2614857 el proyecto camisea que es el mayor productor de gas en per utiliza un energ tico propiedad de todos los peruanos pero las transnacionales como grupo zeta quer an acapararlo todo aunque la mayor a son extranjeros que no invierten tampoco en per es capital que no se queda en el pa s demandamos a estas empresas en la comisi n pro inversi n y logramos que la plus petrol nos vendiera gas porque es un producto nuestro es de todos los peruanos

2614863 its out of line to insinuate that we should blacklist people for speaking their minds
2614864 its a strange thing when people in this country cant express their opinions without being attacked

2614867 most importantly business users can obtain enterprise level support from sun but not just sun for either staroffice or openoffice
2614868 the business of supporting openoffice org and for that matter staroffice is in fact growing astonishingly fast around the world the mac element is pivotal too even in areas where you see few macs such as in india though that may be changing too
2614869 but the mac presence grants cios and others tasked with choosing the right software for their organizations the assurance and confidence that they can adopt the opendocument format our native format and the only published iso standard file format for office documents and have an office array that includes macs linux solaris windows and so on
2614870 in short openoffice org and the mac version in particular suture the wounds inflicted by 20 years of divergence the connecting thread is the file format and the understanding that what counts is creating communicating preserving files in a format that resists the fragility of monopoly and the reliance on any one company in fact there is a plugin that gives users the ability to read write odf and with open office 3 0 and staroffice 9 0 well have native support of ooxml which ms office 2007 uses
2614871 staroffice is pitched more to those who want the indemnification against suit by microsoft governments oems and to those who want the ease of having at one go the application plus the most useful extensions
2614872 its also more for those who wish to buy again at the outset the support services training that sun sells
2614873 but support services training are also available for openoffice org and many prefer it over staroffice because it may be in a language that staroffice is so far missing or because an officiating body has insisted that the license of the application be open staroffice is built with open source software same code as openoffice org but the license of the actual application is closed to make modifications one can easily download the corresponding openoffice org code and work with the community

2614886 the republic of south ossetia consists of a checkerboard of georgian inhabited and ossetian inhabited towns and villages the largely ossetian capital city of tskhinvali and most of the other ossetian inhabited communities are governed by the separatist government while the georgian inhabited villages and towns are administered by the georgian government this close proximity and the intermixing of the two communities has made the conflict in south ossetia particularly dangerous since any attempt to create an ethnically pure territory would involve population transfers on a large scale

2614904 hi adam i just came across your website i had my aortic valve replaced in 1982 at 29 years of age i have just found out that i need surgery for an aortic aneurysm im 55 now i have a bjork shiley mechanical valve i asked my surgeon if he would be replacing the valve while he was in there since it is now 26 years old i was surprised to hear that he wouldnt be unless there were problems with it thanks dean

2614914 when it comes to exceptional or extreme drought exceptionally high temperatures the historical assumption that this occurred once every 20 years has now been revised down to between every one and two years
2614915 now this is a serious revision of the impact of climate change on drought
2614916 therefore there is no credible basis for the claims of increasing frequency of exceptional circumstances declarations made in the report these results are consistent with other studies finding lack of adequate validation in global warming effects modeling and lack of skill of climate models at the regional scale except in the few cases noted above the model simulations have no resemblance to patterns of observed droughtedness in the last century we conclude the models have failed internal validation and no further testing is warranted

2614966 were going to move ahead and are moving ahead with the project
2614967 to me theres no way its going to get built
2614968 weve begun the utility preparations on the site were going to continue those and ramp up our selling efforts very shortly we think its a good market and a market that wants this type of product your readers should expect to see the tower coming out of the ground sometime soon
2614969 wci is in talks with their banks to try to get more flexibility in their covenant to cover their interest costs
2614970 i dont see how the banks would let them build another tower
2614971 everyone is just waiting to see whats going to happen with them
2614972 demand continues to be unpredictable from week to week and we saw an increase in defaults and cancellations during the third quarter we are focused on reducing our costs of operation and recently announced a restructuring that we expect will enable us to lower our annual salary and benefit expenses by about 46 million
2614973 it certainly has crossed my mind that wci may not be able to build simply by reading the market trends
2614974 i think it has occurred to people who want the tower and people who dont want the tower across the board people have been asking are they going to be able to pull this off in this market
2614975 the two buildings capture the iconic cast iron design aesthetic of soho with a modern sensibility that reflects the character of this distinctive neighborhood
2614976 now we have a new entity that can receive funds from any number of sources that we can use to preserve affordable housing at gateway which was on my mind through this process and other places
2614977 do we want to be in a city thats economically segregated
2614978 the rescue workers who saved lower manhattan could not afford to live in this community
2614979 anywhere in the area you see a vacant lot somebody is either building on it or has bought it
2614980 for residential south of 96th street prices are 1 500 a square foot so for those buyers who cant afford that kind of level their alternative is to look to brooklyn or queens or new jersey but some people arent interested in living in those places they want to be in manhattan and thats been fueling the harlem market
2614981 i couldnt even find a little one bedroom for under 400 000
2614982 i sensed that this neighborhood has more potential for upside than a lot of areas i looked in brooklyn i looked in queens i looked in harlem proper and east harlem seemed to have the best combination of value and location
2614983 the dialogue four years ago was i guess i could live here and if i want dinner i can go downtown
2614984 now people know they can get a good dinner here in the neighborhood
2614985 you see a lot of old places a lot of old bodegas but then right in the middle of that youll see a gorgeous new restaurant
2614986 there are just very few places in new york city where you can get that
2614987 everyone knows that harlem has become a hot place to be now east harlem is starting to become that too
2614988 thats our decision right now we decided to put it on hold until we get past the credit crunch
2614989 that kind of building needs to be built in an upswing instead of a downswing
2614990 the fact of the matter is when youve got a million dollars to spend on a home youve got all the choices
2614991 its rare for anybody there are so many new condominiums in the marketplace that are trying to be sold it helps to be in this high end price range because its not quite as sensitive to market upturns and downturns
2614992 a name is very important because it lends credibility trump is a brand that connotes luxury
2614993 the w is the same both have huge brand loyalty
2614994 were about even with what we expected were in less than a year of sales and just recently been able to take people into the building
2614995 this is what people have been waiting for this will answer a lot of the questions new yorkers are asking and i think the city has some really exciting things to share
2614996 these are a lot more than places for people to store their cars
2614997 people will be able to express their personalities in each garage
2614998 about a third of them that come in just want a man cave
2614999 were talking about what kind of stone we want or about custom made wrought iron doors
2615000 were kind of like a bunch of ladies sitting around and talking about fabrics but instead its guys
2615001 some people got very upset when it was cleaned youve got to get used to it not looking sooty im sure i will miss the subtler dimmer clock tower
2615002 precious and desperately needed federal financing is being plopped on projects like this that dont really need it
2615003 robert de niro like goldman sachs and american express already has access to capital and other resources for development projects that smaller businesses who are most in need in lower manhattan do not have
2615004 if your purpose is to serve the community you shouldnt throw the costs on the public and push away people who want to go to the movies
2615005 hes a terrific guy and a terrific asset to the city and his festival has brought 1 million people to downtown
2615006 the streets were desolate after 9 11 30 of the small businesses were closing and then the festival came along and brought foot traffic and hope and renewal back to the community
2615007 he thinks he can trademark an entire neighborhood and own the rights to all the arts and entertainment in tribeca
2615008 enormous waves of people coming and going at performance time is not the best fit for a park on a pier
2615009 were trying to give people in the arts a voice they wouldnt otherwise have and unfortunately hes trying to crush it
2615010 subaru makes a car called tribeca and we havent sued subaru
2615011 in my own small way i was contributing to the revival of tribeca too
2615012 we have a limited amount of beachfront so the town board was as i am today very much concerned to preserve the beautiful natural resource
2615013 that is my world view at all times it is indeed an extremely high benchmark
2615014 there is not a huge demand any more for pink concrete the marketplace has already spoken
2615015 would reinvent an obsolete commercial property and create an upscale neighbor that would generate taxes protect the beachfront and enhance property values
2615016 the town has no interest in selling any of its parcels in the marine recreation zone
2615017 were very concerned about preserving the character of our waterfront
2615018 the industry has come to accept longer construction periods and its time that the industry pulled back and re examined the way they do things
2615019 i believe construction can be done in a shorter timeframe if we really prepare to do it
2615020 i believe that a fast tracked development can produce better quality because the enthusiasm of all the workers remains high through to the end
2615021 a long project often turns into a job that people are tired of going to if you keep tight and short and well organized its a win win
2615022 people are getting tired of waiting so long to move into their homes and i agree that they shouldnt have to
2615023 its been very difficult because of the labour shortage now
2615024 if its done within the right parameters i have no problem whatsoever
2615025 id rather have somebody in there for a couple of months than a year
2615026 it has less impact on our community and less impact on our roads and that sort of thing im certain we can work within that framework
2615027 times are tough and were in a hot market so six days a week is not uncommon
2615028 we hear about it more often that is definitely one way of reducing overall length of time
2615029 it really depends on whether theres noise bylaws or other restrictions in place in a municipality on whether or not youre able to do that in communities where you are able to build six days a week and up to seven days a week it does save on the overall length of the project considerably
2615030 right now theres a lot of competition for municipal staff time to review your project
2615031 but the project is very complicated so theres only so much that you can do to speed it up
2615032 most builders would be delighted to be able to do it within that timeframe
2615033 but given the resource constraints that calgary is experiencing that would be very difficult on the other side of things the approval process at the city really tends to lengthen the amount of time that it takes builders to get something done
2615034 as a general rule with developers and builders the shorter the time the better for them
2615035 hey i only want the hd package besides you dont offer the local stations like your competitor
2615036 i buried it it was very sad but then i realized that i could do it again and eat it
2615037 keep chickens tending small flocks in cities suburbs and other small spaces
2615038 over the past two generations weve become completely separated from our food
2615039 i like to say that everything in my garden is chicken related
2615040 you dont realize how bland modern chicken flavor is even if its organic unless you eat a home raised one that wasnt slaughtered at a young age
2615041 i think they taste like eggs theyre prettier but theyre just eggs
2615042 when you crack them open the yolk is almost orange its so fresh
2615043 and it stands up it doesnt go flat we eat them soft boiled and theyre just really really rich the yolk part is very creamy and the outside part has a very nice fresh flavor
2615044 i could go to the grocery store and buy eggs from happy chickens
2615045 with all the construction there is no place for parking we have no access no subway no buses at night we have no lights
2615046 there were new condos being built more people were moving in a lot of the stores that were closed up started to get rented
2615047 not unless they give us some help some nice brownstones the park they promised something
2615048 people dont think to come to down to columbia street to stroll
2615049 i love the fact that there are still working docks nearby
2615050 we live there in spite of that i dont think anyone has an eye on columbia street to become the next anything
2615051 this is one of the best quarters that weve ever had
2615052 we most likely wont see a reaction until after the new year to the credit crunch
2615053 more than any other market in the country there is tremendous equity in our homes
2615054 its a strong solid market with a lot of equity not a lot of inventory and strong demand
2615055 brooklyn is finally starting to reap the rewards of all the new construction
2615056 in the rest of the country housing markets are doing poorly because theres too much inventory people are having a hard time getting mortgages and local economies are beginning to slow none of which has happened here yet
2615057 every time im making architecture its in a world that doesnt exist for me each time its an unfolding of interior spaces details locations new relations among the elements of the ensembles colors and materials that are not always the same each time i try to create something that works in depth
2615058 i dont believe in architecture that repeats itself in an automatic way thats why each of my buildings is different in its details
2615059 the idea was to work with the view in relation to the hudson and with the sunset
2615060 i wanted to escape the traditional neutrality of the curtain wall which doesnt immediately express the fact that you are looking
2615061 im a contextual architect by desire and by conviction and i have been since the moment i began this profession ive always thought that you build a building wherever it is in a particular place with the notion of respecting everything around it
2615062 there are always an enormous number of things to tap into that already belong to a history its our job to reveal the presence of that history what story are we telling what are we continuing in architecture you always make the future on the basis of the past on the structure of the past
2615063 it can be based on contrasts or on a dialogue but each time its a precise analysis of the place and of a sensibility
2615064 i cant imagine transporting it somewhere else even to another location in the center of manhattan
2615065 i put the building in the middle of a very large garden with the effect that this is not a public building that you discover at first glance but through the trees its a protected territory a territory where objects which are inspired by beliefs that are not ours can coexist and shine forth
2615066 my style is the effort each time to find the right reason to do this or that for me what characterizes a style is not always to repeat the same elements in a vocabulary its the permanence of an attitude you can recognize architecture by the permanence of that attitude even if the vocabulary of elements is very different
2615067 i thought of the waterfalls and the rapids around minneapolis to make a building that was an extended echo of the industrial buildings and mills that are there
2615068 i created a peninsula with an architecture built around different buildings simple buildings arab architecture is always geometry and light here its a strict geometry with perforations that create a play of light on the terraces and the buildings underneath
2615069 i hope in any case that my architecture is complex im a believer in complex thought
2615070 a building shouldnt be able to be decoded in a single glance you always want to hide at least a part of your logic you always want a depth in which some aspects raise questions i still cultivate a certain degree of secrecy
2615071 im for a specific architecture and im opposed to a global or generic architecture especially for skyscrapers a tower for me is akin to what the steeples of cathedrals were before and each time from this standpoint you have to create a point of identity
2615072 my bedside reading is the book of intranquility by fernando pessoa its the book of someone who is inactive who is questioning about things that are the most subtle the most insignificant maybe its my way of achieving calm through literature
2615073 if it hadnt been for structuralism i wouldnt be doing what im doing today
2615074 in the electoral campaign there was not much talk of culture even less about architecture
2615075 everyone should know that most cancer research is largely a fraud and that the major cancer research organisations are derelict in their duties to the people who support them
2615076 for the first time in over a year there is some negative talk about the credit markets and whether or not this will permeate the new york city real estate market
2615077 as of right now it hasnt there has been no slowdown
2615078 im still not characterizing the market right now as a housing boom except in the upper echelon
2615079 obviously the market was helped first by the rumor and the reality of bonus money
2615080 but i also think were just in one of those demographic upswing periods
2615081 more people are moving into the city fewer people are moving out and the rental market got much tighter over the course of 2006 which once again made buying a more attractive option you put all those things together and the market sort of entered the narrow part of the hourglass
2615082 ive had 20 percent more business from international clients in the past couple of years
2615083 they probably account for 30 to 35 percent its a world market now
2615084 when you look at hotel rates and what it costs to come into manhattan it makes sense now to buy a pied terre
2615085 the baby boomer generation isnt ready to give up and live in a swamp
2615086 rents are rising again and that pushes people back into the condo and co op market if they have more than a one or two year time frame for living in manhattan
2615087 if we didnt have new development coming on at the pace we did wed have a chronic shortage across all sectors and wed see 20 percent price growth
2615088 there are so many new units coming on the market and being sold but the real heart and soul of the co op market is really depleted
2615089 you remind sellers that there is a moral component but my duty is to get the highest amount and moral and the highest amount dont necessarily overlap
2615090 while i dont think we were propped up to the extent other markets were by subprime and adjustable rate mortgages it does make credit hard to get for everyone to some degree
2615091 most people are probably expecting mortgages to be tougher to get
2615092 pay is going to probably drop but if its dropping from a really really high level were probably not going to have any charity dinners for these people
2615093 then the fact that we have a lower level of supply coming on would help keep the market from correcting
2615094 my brokers are saying their biggest frustration is to have buyers when theres no product and that theres nothing out there but new construction
2615095 we may have bumps but i dont feel the underpinnings are weakening my biggest problem this month is that i have all my salespeople taking vacations because they made so much money my east side office is a ghost town
2615096 50 million is the new 30 million somehow 40 million was skipped
2615097 these two factors combined to force prices up breaking through the glass ceiling to new levels
2615098 nouvels exciting concept has the potential to become an international architectural design icon
2615099 akulah jalan dan kebenaran dan hidup tidak ada seorangpun yang datang kepada bapa kalau tidak melalui aku
2615100 and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
2615101 intellectuals have trouble seeing quality small children and uneducated people see it
2615102 let the little children come to me for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these
2615103 our dear brother paul who wrote you with the wisdom that god gave him
2615104 those along the footpath are the ones who hear and then the devil comes along and takes away the word from their hearts so they cannot believe and be saved
2615105 listen for gods voice in everything you do and everywhere you go hes the one who will keep you on track
2615106 how do you know that isnt part of the test
2615107 drink the cup that i must drink and are baptized with the baptism which i must be baptized
2615108 the problem with christianity is that it insists on seeing itself as a separate religion instead of a healing message for all religions
2615109 dont give up the habit of meeting together instead let us encourage one another
2615110 partly to challenge the pagan celebration of the roman god saturnalia which was characterized by social disorder and immorality
2615111 jesus said it is to those who are worthy of my mysteries that i tell my mysteries
2615112 he who will not eat of my body and drink of my blood so that he will be made one with me and i with him the same shall not know salvation
2615113 blest is the happy man who knows the mysteries the gods ordain and sanctifies his life joins soul with soul in mystic unity and by due ritual made pure enters the ecstasy of mountain solitudes who observes the mystic rites made lawful by the great mother who crowns his head with ivy and shakes his wand in worship of dionysus
2615114 these mysteries have brought us from rustic savagery to a cultivated and refined civilization
2615115 knows the end of life and its god given beginning
2615116 we beheld the beatific visions and were initiated into the mystery which may be truly called blessed celebrated by us in a state of innocence we beheld calm happy simple eternal visions resplendent in pure light
2615117 it is a hard road to follow filled with darkness and gloom but if an initiate leads you on the way it becomes brighter than the radiance of the sun
2615118 every initiation aims at uniting us with the world and with the deity
2615119 as if borne away or possessed by a god he attains to solitude in untroubled stillness nowhere deflected in his being and unbruised with self utterly at rest and become very rest he does not converse with a statue or image but with godhead itself and this is no object of vision but another mode of seeing a detachment from self a simplification and surrender of self a yearning for contact and a stillness and meditation directed towards transformation whoever sees himself in this way has attained likeness to god let him abandon himself and find the end of his journeying
2615120 i came out of the mystery hall feeling like a stranger to myself
2615121 a mystery religion was thus a divine drama which portrayed before the wondering eyes of the privileged observers the story of the struggles sufferings and victory of a patron deity the travail of nature in which life ultimately triumphs over death and joy is born of pain the whole ritual of the mysteries aimed especially at quickening the emotional life no means of exciting the emotions was neglected in the passion play either by way of inducing careful predispositions or of supplying external stimulus tense mental anticipations heightened by a period of abstinence hushed silences imposing processions and elaborate pageantry music loud and violent or soft and enthralling delirious dances the drinking of spirituous liquors physical macerations alternations of dense darkness and dazzling light the sight of gorgeous ceremonial vestments the handling of holy emblems auto suggestion and the promptings of the hierophant these and many secrets of emotional exaltation were in vogue
2615122 dionysus was the god of the most blessed ecstasy and the most enraptured love but he was also the persecuted god the suffering and dying god and all whom he loved all who attended him had to share his tragic fate
2615123 it is not necessary for the initiated to learn anything but to receive impressions and to be put in a certain frame of mind
2615124 sympathy of the soul with the ritual in a way that is unintelligible to us and divine so that some of the initiates axe stricken with panic being filled with divine awe others assimilate themselves to the holy symbols leave their own identity become at home with the gods afford experience divine possession
2615125 it looks as if those also who established rites of initiation for us were no fools but that there is a hidden meaning in their teachings
2615126 to wish to teach all men the truth of the gods causes the foolish to despise because they cannot learn and the good to be slothful whereas to conceal the truth by myths prevents the former from despising philosophy and compels the latter to study it
2615127 philosophers and theologians do not disclose the meanings embedded in these stories to laymen but simply give them preliminary instruction in the form of a myth but those who have reached the higher grades of the mysteries they initiate into clear knowledge in the privacy of the holy shrine in the light cast by the blazing torch of truth
2615128 found no difficulty in conforming to any religion in vogue
2615129 this went a long way towards weaning the minds of men from the idea of separate gods from the different nations and towards teaching them that all national and local deities were but different forms of one great power but for the rise of christianity and other religions there can be little doubt but that the whole of the greco roman deities would continually have merged into dionysus
2615130 the egyptians of every period in which they are known to us believed that osiris was of divine origin that he suffered death and mutilation at the hands of the power of evil that after great struggle with these powers he rose again that he became henceforth the king of the underworld and judge of the dead and that because he had conquered death the righteous might also conquer death
2615131 he represented to men the idea of a man who was both god and man and he typified to the egyptians in all ages the being who by reason of his sufferings and death as a man could sympathies with them in their own sickness and death the idea of his human personality also satisfied their cravings and yearnings for communion with a being who though he was partly divine yet had much in common with themselves originally they looked upon osiris as a man who lived on the earth as they lived who ate and drank who suffered a cruel death who by help of certain gods triumphed over death and attained unto everlasting life but what osiris did they could also do
2615132 having heard it proclaimed through the prophets that the christ was to come and that the ungodly among men were to be punished by fire the wicked spirits put forward many to be called sons of god under the impression that they would be able to produce in men the idea that the things that were said with regard to christ were merely marvelous tales like the things that were said by the poets
2615133 are these distinctive happenings unique to the christians and if so how are they unique or are ours to be accounted myths and theirs believed what reasons do the christians give for the distinctiveness of their beliefs in truth there is nothing at all unusual about what the christians believe except that they believe it to the exclusion of more comprehensive truths about god
2615134 the devil whose business is to pervert the truth mimics the exact circumstances of the divine sacraments he baptizes his believers and promises forgiveness of sins from the sacred fount and thereby initiates them into the religion of mithras thus he celebrates the oblation of bread and brings in the symbol of the resurrection let us therefore acknowledge the craftiness of the devil who copies certain things of those that be divine
2615135 son of zeus in his full nature god most terrible although most gentle to mankind
2615136 god sent his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
2615137 that is why i have changed my immortal form and taken the likeness of man
2615138 in saying that the word was born for us without sexual union as jesus christ our teacher we introduce nothing beyond what is said of those called the sons of zeus
2615139 arrived in some way at the truth for on god the father he had said everything and on the son
2615140 every pharaoh had to be the son of god and a human mother in order that he should be the incarnate god the giver of fertility to his country and people
2615141 like a madman calling out to people at the top of his voice and urging them to reject this realm and what is in it and go back to their own original sublime and noble word
2615142 they include some striking points of similarity to the gospel narratives of the birth of christ the senate is supposed with ludicrous implausibility to have decreed a ban on rearing male roman babies in the year of augustus birth because of a portent indicating that a king of rome had been born on top of this slaughter of the innocents we are offered an annunciation his mother aria dreamed during a visit to the temple of apollo that the god had visited his favor on her in the form of snake augustus was born nine months later
2615143 this day has given the earth an entirely new aspect the world would have gone to destruction had there not streamed forth from him who is now born a common blessing rightly does he judge who recognizes in this birthday the beginning of life now is that time ended when men pitie
2615144 i came here to learn how to do that from you youre the ones who live in this culture youre the persons many of you who were hindus once what was it that compelled you to become a christian
2615145 monism does not see mans dilemma as moral in terms of what he has done but as metaphysical in terms of who he is monism thus leads to the notion that a man cannot be helped as an individual because his individuality is the essential problem he must be helped from his individuality he must merge with the absolute myer baba says a real merging of the limited in the ocean of universal life involves complete surrender of separate existence in all its forms now this cannot but lead to a radical negation of any positive aspiration toward individuality in this life
2615146 if he left off dreaming about you where do you suppose youd be
2615147 no not you tweedle dee retorted contemptuously youd be nowhere why youre only a sort of thing in his dream if that there king was to wake
2615148 youre thinking too hard youre using logic logic isnt the way to find truth experience is
2615149 no i said it isnt the way to truth experience is
2615150 because your way of thinking accepts the notion of contradictions so if experience is the way to truth not logic then experience also is not the way to truth logic is the way to truth and it isnt at the same time the point being you cant even talk about your own philosophy if its logically contradictory it becomes nonsense to even discuss it
2615151 for even though they knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks but they became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart was darkened professing to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible god for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four footed animals and crawling creatures therefore god gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity that their bodies might be dishonored among them for they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever
2615152 shine jesus shine fill this land with the fathers glory blaze spirit blaze set our hearts on fire flow river flow flood the nations with grace and mercy send forth you word lord and let there be light
2615153 father fill this land with your glory flood the nations with grace and mercy because they desperately need it
2615154 in what sense is it a lost book of the bible
2615155 no theyre not my beliefs thats why theyre in the trash if they were really mine theyd be in the book
2615156 but to those who remain outside the covenant truth can be shown only in parables this is because they live in a world of illusions and shadows where truth is hidden from them only the shadow of truth can reach them until they reject the lie and come into the covenant of light
2615157 he never left behind the ones he made in high school
2615158 we can still see your smiling face happy go lucky smile not a care in the world
2615159 i dont know the family or anything im just here to help if i can to make sure those people dont get near the family
2615160 could never stand still there was a whole world to see and everywhere he went he brought light and joy
2615161 from your first breath you were loved beyond imagination and although you were taken from us too quickly we will never say goodbye but for now see you later
2615162 if you were in a bad mood he would make you in a great mood
2615163 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2615164 we have been appealing to beijing to solve the issue through political dialogue to prevent the situation from deteriorating but they have never taken it seriously
2615165 on the contrary they heightened the suppression beijing should be directly responsible for todays incident
2615166 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2615167 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all
2615168 figment of the tabloid press i dont want that garbage in with the puppy story
2615169 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2615170 we go to church and serve the lord and try to lead good lives and do good things
2615171 she is a person of note in our little community
2615172 i apologize for what i did but you also need to apologize to me for what youve done
2615173 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
2615174 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
2615175 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
2615176 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
2615177 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
2615178 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
2615179 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
2615180 has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades
2615181 it would be a mistake a misinterpretation to think that a huge rollback or reversal of fundamental trends is under way
2615182 distance and trade costs do matter but we are still in a globalized era
2615183 theres just a handful of us left but it has become easier for us domestic folks to compete
2615184 being green is in their best interests not so much in making money as saving money
2615185 green companies are likely to be a permanent trend as these vulnerabilities continue but its going to take a long time for all this to settle down
2615186 cannot take a risk that the just in time system wont function because the whole global trading system is based on that notion
2615187 they are going to have to have redundancies in the supply chain like more warehousing and multiple sources of supply and even production
2615188 there is such a trend for the click fast deal but for such an important vacation you really want to think it through
2615189 renting a condo for a week can inclusive vacation will also include airfare beverages tips and more activities in the price both options have a high level recreation is on the vacation menu at kempinski hotel ajman al bawaba recreation is on the

2615193 he went to windsor which is just down the street its not like he left the country
2615194 his struggles and cries are ignored the man with the knife shows no emotion the victim is slaughtered and his head cut off his flesh is eaten

2615197 it is well known that international security comprises much more than issues relating to military and political stability it involves the stability of the global economy overcoming poverty economic security and developing a dialogue between civilisations
2615198 this universal indivisible character of security is expressed as the basic principle that
2615199 when peace has been broken anywhere the peace of all countries everywhere is in danger
2615200 the history of humanity certainly has gone through unipolar periods and seen aspirations to world supremacy and what hasnt happened in world history however what is a unipolar world however one might embellish this term at the end of the day it refers to one type of situation namely one centre of authority one centre of force one centre of decision making it is world in which there is one master one sovereign and at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within and this certainly has nothing in common with democracy because as you know democracy is the power of the majority in light of the interests and opinions of the minority
2615201 incidentally russia we are constantly being taught about democracy but for some reason those who teach us do not want to learn themselves
2615202 however today we are witnessing the opposite tendency namely a situation in which countries that forbid the death penalty even for murderers and other dangerous criminals are airily participating in military operations that are difficult to consider legitimate and as a matter of fact these conflicts are killing people hundreds and thousands of civilians
2615203 in connection with this i would like to recall that in the 1980s the ussr and the united states signed an agreement on destroying a whole range of small and medium range missiles but these documents do not have a universal character
2615204 we would like to interact with responsible and independent partners with whom we could work together in constructing a fair and democratic world order that would ensure security and prosperity not only for a select few but for all
2615205 just look at how close it is its anyones at the moment and its just a case of doing everything right on the day
2615206 there wasnt much between us so its going to be an interesting final tomorrow morning i feel happy with that it was good comfortable with a fast qualifying time
2615207 park went pretty fast it was probably his best time or right on it

2615209 find most of their prospects using lists from school districts containing the names phone numbers and addresses of high school juniors and seniors districts were required by the 2002 no child left behind law to provide that information to the military

2615211 devane said he also mines for potential recruits at community centers syracuse crunch games and high school sports events rock concerts and at wal mart k mart and convenience stores
2615212 recruiters for the armed forces and military academies are invited into c ns every monday so that students can talk to them during lunch

2615215 setiap kerajaan yang terpecah pecah pasti binasah dan setiap rumah tangga yang terpecah pecah pasti runtuh jikalau iblis itu juga terbagi bagi dan melawan dirinya sendiri bagaimanakah kerajaannya dapat bertahan
2615216 beginilah firman tuhan semesta alam sesungguhnya malapetaka akan menjalar dari bangsa ke bangsa suatu badai besar akan berkecamuk dari ujung ujung bumi maka pada hari itu akan bergelimpangan orang orang yang mati terbunuh oleh tuhan dari ujung bumi sampai ke ujung bumi mereka tidakakan diratapi tidak akan dikumpulkan dan tidak akan dikuburkan mereka akan menjadi pupuk di lading
2615217 sebab itu bangkitlah murka tuhan terhadap umatnya diacungkannya tangannya terhadap mereka dan dipukulnya mereka gunung gunung akan gemetar dan mayat mayat mereka seperti kotoran ditengah jalan sekalipun semuanya terjadi murkanya belum surut dan tangannya masih teracung

2615226 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2615227 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2615228 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone

2615238 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

2615244 some say that this government malikis government backtracked from its sectarism by striking the sadrists trend to balance the strikes on the sadirsts and the sunnis in some areas and we say this is a smokescreen it is still the same sectarian government and the strikes on the al sadr trend happened because the trend is forming a big pressure on the government and becomes a strong competitor in the upcoming elections this is the desire of some foreign interference from here and there who wants to marginalize this trend because in the sadrists trend there are patriots who do not want to divide iraq and oppose the occupation forces therefore this trend had been attacked despite that some of the ignorants outlaws who has been paid to do against their brothers in prior periods
2615245 they will not separate because in spite of the current political operations if the two parties puk and kdp were to declare separation the kurdish people will not support them
2615246 deploying forces from the south in kirkuk according to item 24 of the provincial election bill is a re arabization of the city
2615247 other iraqi sides cannot reach a consensus to solve this issue as they object to any new suggestion and insist on item 24
2615248 enacting item 24 was a conspiracy against the kurds similar to the issues of oil contracts and kurdistan regions budget aimed at limiting kurds power
2615249 those who maintain that article 140 of the iraqi constitution is dead are instigating public unrest
2615250 it is unfortunate but unsurprising that epa has once again ignored a stark environmental reality

2615285 this deliberate strategy of aggression has grown into a full scale military intervention involving all regions of georgia
2615286 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2615287 our unomig military observers report ongoing military preparation by the abkhaz de facto authorities for a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2615288 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2615289 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2615290 the georgians have made an offer of a cease fire and its concerning that the russians wont respond to that
2615291 its clear that the russians are looking to prolong the conflict in some way because they will give no assurances either about a cessation of hostilities or about withdrawing their forces
2615292 there is great dispute and controversy about the origins of this including prior mobilization of russian troops on the other side of the georgian border
2615293 it the eu presidency demands an immediate ceasefire it welcomes the offer of the ceasefire from georgia and expects from russia that it will immediately accept such a ceasefire
2615294 it the eu strongly proclaims its attachment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders and urges russia to respect these
2615295 it underlines that the pursuit of military action would affect its relationship with russia

2615299 with these special circumstances and the special background of the eve of the beijing olympic games hostile forces at home and abroad will surely act like cornered mad dogs and step up their terror and sabotage activities

2615303 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2615304 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2615305 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2615306 we have not received through any channels any appeal from the georgian leadership to the president of russia

2615310 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2615311 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2615312 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2615313 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2615314 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2615315 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2615316 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2615317 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2615364 you have to understand i have come into a new club where there are a lot of things different to what i am used to
2615365 it takes time to get the place running how i want it to its early days but these things will get sorted out quickly and we will move on i was at blackburn for four years and i knew exactly how things were done the lines of communication what have you
2615366 at the moment its not quite as it was at blackburn every operation is a different operation its a case of understanding that and working with it
2615367 weve had no bids for stephen this time of year people get ahead of themselves and interpret certain things i have spoken to stephen and he is fine with it
2615368 we are working to that end to conclude deals there is not that much of the window left but you can do business right until the last minute and that is what we will try and do
2615369 it was a great goal a fantastic finish and you saw his enthusiasm he is desperate to do well and play well he has got to keep fit and keep well and keep on the field of play if he does that he will be a real impact player for us this season
2615370 have you ever felt like throwing bill sali out a window
2615371 its a good spot to be in and more importantly the car is running great
2615372 today we went out there and found the limit the first round single tomorrow doesnt matter we want to win the race and to do that you need to win four rounds obviously were not worried about the first round thats the easy one its the other three rounds that were worried about were in a beautiful place and the suns going to be out and itll be a little slippery and the driver is going to come into play and its going to be fun thats what i wake up for theres a little gladiator in all of us
2615373 winning the last three races doesnt matter now you have to forget about the western swing you have to focus on this race every round there are guys out there who would like to win one race so to win five in a row is pretty tough you cant get caught up in trying to win four in a row or five in a row you have to stay focused on winning the round you are running when we finally get beat then we can talk about how many we were able to win in a row
2615374 its great to be no 1 but we really hope to win some rounds tomorrow
2615375 weve struggled at the last few races even though weve been qualifying well we just havent had any luck im happy about being no 1 but im trying not to get too excited this is the best qualifying performance weve had at john force racing in a while were all in the top half of the field so hopefully we wont race each other until the late rounds
2615376 we didnt set the world on fire today and didnt exactly build our confidence any perhaps we lulled the competition into a false sense of security and weve got them right where we want them for tomorrow well be alright we knew the sun was going to be out today so we tried some things with the setup and just missed it because the racetrack didnt go away as much as we thought it might we did learn some things we know where the edge is now i am going into the first round thinking ive got the baddest hot rod on the planet thats the confidence i get from the crew ive got over there working on this car
2615377 ive been fighting a little bit of a kidney stone and its about to wear me out
2615378 we debuted a brand new bike here and i think weve got a good bike for tomorrow we knew it was a good bike yesterday on the second pass yesterday i did a bad job of riding and it still ran a 6 98 we tried a test deal today on the second run and it didnt work out so tomorrow well go back to basics and well be alright
2615379 ive been taking some tylenol for the pain i am going to the hospital tonight hopefully we can get it broke up tonight ill spend some time in there if i have to
2615380 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her privacy now or in the future

2615382 the need to demonstrate our sovereignty in the arctic has never been more important which is why our government has made this research a top priority
2615383 our commitment to this initiative as well as other investments in the north is ultimately about turning potential into prosperity for this remarkable region and for our country as a whole
2615384 im excited and im glad to put an end to all the rumors and get rid of all the speculation and solidify my position at dei im looking forward to running the bass pro shops no 1 the rest of this year and next year im looking forward to doing great things with the company and moving forward this season has been kind of up and down for us but i really believe in my race team i believe in the things were doing at the shop that we can contend to win races and get back to the forum we had last year im looking forward to starting that off this weekend here at watkins glen weve run well here in the past ive always had good success here in everything weve ever driven last year was a really good race for us here probably one of the best ive ever driven at this race track so im looking forward to the weekend so hopefully well start this thing off and have a good run this weekend and keep things going throughout the rest of the season and get prepared good for next year
2615385 were very excited to have martin back for 2009 and as he said hes a very important part of our program and he knows how much we appreciate him and all of our drivers at dei weve been focused on the long term future of the company and putting a lot of resources in the competition area john story and the rest of the management team have done a tremendous job at elevating all of our programs and were excited to give him all the support that we can to compete for a championship
2615386 weve said all along one of the most difficult things that weve had to battle as a company is certainly competition on the race track but also perception and this is a big step to let everybody know that we are in fact still around and that were a strong company one of the things weve worked really hard on max talked about the competition and the motorsports side of our business which is at the end of the day what we do obviously its the only thing we do weve worked very closely with martin through this whole process one of the reasons it has taken so long quite frankly is that weve had a lot of good strong ongoing dialogue about how to make the company stronger youre going to see new people coming into our organization very soon youre going to see us putting into practice all the tools and equipment that we have so that all of our cars will take the next step and move up obviously its our goal for martin to win a championship at dei and anything short of that as weve always said will be falling short of our goals we know that martin can do that and were certainly excited about it for at least this year and next
2615387 yeah its through 2009 for right now and a little bit down the road were going to look at doing some long term stuff
2615388 so its been tough but like i said were going to get through it i feel like were getting stronger as a company and as a race team i really believe in the people weve got i believe in my race team especially im a big part of what goes on there when we have a bad day or a bad week or we go down the wrong road somewhere i take responsibility for that too i dont sit back and say well you know my cars are no good and my team is no good im a part of that race team too i know we need to get better were working hard im working hard and i really believe in the people ive got i know what we did last year i know what we are capable of and thats a big part of what led me to this decision
2615389 well first of all martin has moved into a leadership role in our company very seamlessly and has stepped into that and accelerated it he has been a big part of a lot of direction weve taken in the competition area he and i had a conversation last week and i said it was critical to get feedback from him the best feedback we can get from anyone in the company is from someone sitting behind the wheel and driving that car so he is a very important part of our team hes a huge leader with all four of our drivers were really excited about him being there its amazing how granular martin gets with the details of what we need to do to accelerate our program to the next level
2615390 and when things dont go right sometimes they point the finger at you too but i like a good challenge i can accept that i could have maybe been weak and took the easy road and said no i cant do this i cant handle this but im accepting the challenge and looking forward to it i think we can do great things together
2615391 last week was a really tough situation because we didnt get any practice at pocono we unloaded in qualifying trim and we were really fast so we just kind of went into the race blind so we didnt get the results we were looking for but hes done a really good job of coming in and keeping the team together and keeping the guys pumped up and getting all their jobs done and with that everybody on the team has stepped up to do the next guys job and theyve done a good job as small as it sounds theyre through tech inspection on time and the cars are prepared right everything is getting done the way it needs to it sounds small but its a big deal so thats gone well and im looking forward to this weekend and continuing that relationship with greci i dont really think hes had a fair shot at doing a whole weekend yet with the practice in the rain and the stuff at indy with the tires but ive been counting down the days until richmond so i can get bono and gary back
2615392 i would say that mark martin has been and continues to be a tremendous asset to our organization he worked very closely with us when we wanted to focus on the long term future of the company and develop our younger drivers aric almirola we all felt was ready to run a full season and we talked about doing what was in everybodys best interest we want four cars and one team and we want to put points on the board and win the respect of the people for what were doing on the track and not what we say and mark was very helpful in helping us map out where were going in the future
2615393 as far as our 2009 program obviously our goals have not changed four cars is our objective for next year certainly the no 1 with martin the no 15 with paul menard the no 8 with aric almirola and regan smith in the no 01 but we are all still working to round out sponsorship on the no 01 car the goal remains to run all four teams next year
2615394 well i think they get criticized a lot for the way the wind blows sometimes it seems like i dont know what it is if we run 10th its not good enough obviously we need to win a championship we havent done that i dont know its always a bad story its never a good one even if we do good there is always the negative side of it we just need to perform on the race track and the rest of it will take care of itself
2615395 its hard to think about that i dont know what i would do without him like i said since ive been a driver for a living hes the only guy ive worked with when i think about tony stewart and greg zipadelli and what theyve done over ten years i think its going to be difficult for him not having him at his side its going to be a big big change whether its good or not i dont know i guess theyll find out and we will too but im not sure i was ready for that yet there is still a lot we need to accomplish together i feel like i think hes still getting better as a crew chief and i look forward to working with him for a long time its hard to think about change sometimes but i wasnt ready for it
2615396 no the things that made this process longer were things that i was trying to get straight with dei things that we were talking about we worked hard as max said going through and talking about things that we needed to change things that we needed to get better and would we be able to do these things what is it going to take we really just had to go through all that and i had to really trust them and believe in them and we need to make these things happen and get the job done
2615397 yeah i think that all of us are committed to making the entire company better and we look each other in the eye and were honest with one another about what we can do to support each other in trying to build something great
2615398 one of the things i really enjoy about our relationship the three of us is that we talk constantly and we are pretty brutally honest about what we need to do to get better as individuals as managers as an athlete and as an organization so thats our intent what we wanted to do was get especially the speculation for 2009 out of the way so we can concentrate on finishing this year and getting ready for next year but i fully do anticipate the questions starting to come again
2615399 boris is known around the world as one of the premier road course racers
2615400 he will give us another great opportunity to assess our program everyone at petty enterprises is grateful to boris for helping us out
2615401 i have to move out of the region for work
2615402 as the price drops naturally the number of people willing to sell at that level will fall also
2615403 my question is why people are still paying over inflated prices for housing units
2615404 its a perception reflected in the numbers the worlds long haul international travelers have jumped by 35 million since 2000 yet america has been largely overlooked by those new travelers despite favorable exchange rates resulting from a weak dollar and attractions like disney world and the grand canyon in fact the annual number of foreign visitors to the us is about 2 million lower than in 2000 leading travel industry experts to figure that from 2000 to 2007 the us economy took a hit of about 150 billion
2615405 greg sounds like you are cheerleading again everything is great
2615406 oh stressed wa is seeing the slow down that florida had a couple of years ago
2615407 oh i spoke with her she says things are fine and selling xxxxx homes per month and prices are going up
2615408 my home is not selling because the realtor is bad
2615409 must be a new data source that redfin acquired via oodle they have had the oodle listings on there for a while but not so many as showed up today

2615411 for 2008 gardner is predicting anywhere from zero appreciation to home prices falling as much as 5 percent
2615412 conway anticipates average puget sound region home prices will decline less than 1 percent next year
2615413 i know its hard but you will get your own room to the teenager
2615414 also it looks seattle has held up alright considering the mortgage crisis
2615415 4 pension and entitlement programs designed for 10 workers for every retiree are now facing 3 to 1 or even lower worker retiree ratios
2615416 6 stagnant declining wages and rising unemployment are the inevitable result of reduced borrowing spending by consumers and government alike
2615417 total decline from peak chart tim can i use it i met with a client last night that said financial experts tell her its a year or two and not drastic while i am saying it could be 3 5 years and 35 to 50 from peak before it turns around
2615418 today i have two rss feeds for the types of homes neighborhoods in which i am interested for the last week or so of
2615419 why are so many people trying to sell after just buying so recently is this a new trend or are there always a lot of people trying to sell within a year of buying
2615420 hey i heard people are flipping home and making a killing
2615421 are you saying this may be a faux gem how can they call it a gem if it isnt have they no shame
2615422 is there some compelling argument why home prices in seattle should be averaging around 6 per year appreciation since 1990
2615423 we also have lower unemployment and higher wages than elsewhere
2615424 we also have lower unemployment and higher wages than elsewhere
2615425 dang everytime i come here i see charts i hate charts i must be the only one i had a horrible time in geometry and maybe thats the reason then i took intro to logic at the uw a 100 level class and i dropped it in 3 days i didnt understand anything
2615426 yes there is a good reason why seattle should appreciate at a higher rate this is because cities like new york are world class cities which are well established and have firm footing on high housing prices seattle is not a world class city and has a lot more room to improve as it is one of the best of the rest
2615427 holed up in my cheap rental b c housings gonna crater
2615428 the pacnw as a whole is special and part of that specialness is seattle
2615429 all in all portland seattle price will have to fall another 15 20 draw a line vertically from the current position to the middle from the 2007 highs before they gravitate to the mean dont worry folks we will be there soon within 2 years
2615430 and that was when the economy still had some legs which are now just stumps
2615431 lol so one sided here let me guess you are in all cash you have lost nothing on the equity declines you make all the right moves
2615432 i didnt hit the ball as well as i have been at the beginning
2615433 my driver was going a little left and the rough was just so thick that it kind of can be a little trickier i was putting well and everything came together on the last part of the front nine
2615434 if i didnt have the first tee butterflies then i would know something was wrong but im going to try to stay calm and just play my best because it will be a long day im not going to try to let my nerves get to me too much turn it into energy i guess
2615435 je me sens comme si on mavait enlev un gros poids sur les paules

2615437 union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2615438 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2615439 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2615440 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2615441 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2615442 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2615443 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2615444 it was just sitting in the middle of the floor i can touch it if i want to

2615447 but the suggestion that women and feminist women at that will be lining up behind him is a fairytale at least it should be mccains record and policies on issues of importance to women are neither moderate nor maverick
2615448 in the nation katha pollitt put it simply t o vote for mccain a feminist would have to be insane
2615449 at one point cindy playfully twirled mccains hair and said youre getting a little thin up there

2615513 i think the lesson lies to some degree elsewhere it lies in the method of the campaigning the style of the campaigning and the appeal to the electorate and i think we certainly need to look at the early election that was certainly a disturbing factor
2615514 at this stage its very much too close to call

2615521 m s de cuatro a os de su vida gastaron mar a y eduardo en un noviazgo aparentemente feliz que se acab cuando terminaron la carrera que estudiaron juntos fue como si hubieran agotado los temas de conversaci n que ten an en la universidad para entrar en una competencia profesional que lejos de dar trascendencia a su relaci n marcaba territorios incompatibles finalmente eduardo confes que cuando se dio cuenta de que su noviazgo le reclamaba mas formalidad tuvo miedo de continuar porque necesitaba tiempo para saber si mar a era la mujer con quien realmente deseaba pasar el resto de su vida su caso es el de cada vez m s parejas modernas que huyen de la responsabilidad como del demonio incluso cuando ya tienen todo preparado para la boda quiz s no supieron nunca que el verdadero amor no se traduce en sentir bonito cuando se est frente a la pareja y que tampoco significa estar de acuerdo en todo lo que se hace porque cuando realmente se ama a alguien se adquiere el compromiso moral de ayudarlo respetuosamente a ser mejor a que crezca como ser humano en todos los aspectos cuando los j venes sue an con encontrar al pr ncipe azul o a la s per mujer para ser felices siempre tendr n que plantearse con toda seriedad si no est n esquizofr nicos porque un mundo as solo se da en las letras o en las telenovelas donde navegamos a merced de la imaginaci n del autor pero no en el mundo donde el creador ha dispuesto para los hombres la felicidad y el sufrimiento los logros y los fracasos la aceptaci n y el rechazo y la lucha constante y permanente desde que nacemos hasta que dejamos de respirar hace poco llego a mis manos una informaci n de cimac en la que martha celia herrera psicoterapeuta del centro de interdisciplina conductuales asegura que las mujeres aun hoy conservan la expectativa de encontrar a un hombre maduro productivo estable rico inteligente paternal que cambie pa ales que las acompa e al pediatra que sepa preparar papillas que sea una excelente pareja tierno que externe sus emociones que no pida relaciones intimas cuando ella est enojada que sea emp tico ellos entre tanto buscan a la mujer de sus sue os productiva inteligente excelente anfitriona que desee uno o dos hijos cuando l lo decida que no pida dinero que sea autosuficiente independiente y aut noma que colabore en la econom a familiar y que cuide a los ni os que lave planche cocine y tenga bien arreglada la casa adem s de que se d tiempo para cuidar su apariencia que siempre est s per delgada que sea vea sexy etc etc la doctora herrera dice que con la revoluci n sexual y el feminismo se rompi el equilibrio tradicional entre el papel que correspond a a los hombres y el que estaba destinado a las mujeres los varones se asustan frente a las mujeres que compiten con ellos en su espacio laboral y que a menudo est n m s calificadas que ellos y esa amenaza a veces se extiende al campo sentimental influye tambi n que se dividieron los roles pero nunca quedaron delineados ahora la mujer tiene m s actividades que antes porque debe estudiar trabajar y atender a su familia hecho que resulta desconcertante para todos las expectativas femeninas y las masculinas son irreales y poco objetivas muchos ni siquiera son capaces de expresar lo que esperan del otro yo no soy psicoterapeuta pero se que en la vida nada es m gico ni gratuito los hombres y las mujeres hemos sido siempre los mismos aunque las circunstancias han cambiado y en este rengl n no tan positivamente como seria deseable hoy queremos que todo sea f cil y desechable pero eso no es posible en las personas nadie est ya hecho la vida entera no nos alcanza a veces para irnos moldeando seg n nuestras metas y proyectos de la misma manera dos seres inacabados que tendr an que estar conscientes de que van a esculpirse juntos durante toda la vida anhelar un pr ncipe azul o una s per mujer junto a nosotros no es un pecado pero si puede llegar a convertirse en un obst culo para ser felices al lado de un ser humano de carne y hueso con potencialidades y miserias que como nosotros necesita comprensi n y verdadero amor para perfeccionarse poco a poco si hoy tantas relaciones se rompen despu s de un tiempo de tratarse en su noviazgo es precisamente porque no estamos dispuestos a trabajar para forjar una relaci n sana sincera basada en el verdadero amor que no es solo romanticismo sino prueba constante de fidelidad comunicaci n respeto y de humanidad curiosamente la doctora herrera concluye que mientras estudian licenciaturas maestr as y doctorados hombres y mujeres no se dan tiempo para habilitarse en pareja para hablar de si mismos todo eso se queda guardado y cuando cumplen 30 a os o m s deciden tener un compa ero suponen que como por arte de magia contar n con habilidades que no desarrollaron porque nunca se dieron tiempo para hacerlo para relacionarse con otra persona hay que estar dispuesto a negociar a manejar enojos a discutir no pelear porque aunque existan puntos de vista diferentes es posible conseguir objetivos que satisfagan a los dos dice la doctora pero eso cuesta quiz s el problema radica en que nadie desea comprometerse a entablar la lucha por lograrlo demasiado ego smo dir a yo cada d a son m s las mujeres y hombres profesionistas independientes inteligentes y de exito que ven pasar los a os sin encontrar pareja personas de todas las clases sociales se encuentran frente al mismo problema son solteros y solteras se han quedado atrapados as en un espacio dentro de la sociedad actual muy limitado en cuanto a diversiones y actividades y se les dificulta mucho encontrar personas en su misma situaci n ya no se diga para casarse sino simplemente para acompa arse y entablar una buena amistad ya no existe la palabra solter n a y su imagen ha cambiado 180 grados ya no es el hombre o la mujer gris amargada vestido como fraile o monja seg n sea el caso ahora son seres impecables atractivos as de muy buen car cter que van supliendo la juventud con personalidad y desarrollo humano e intelectual que hay demasiadas mujeres y pocos hombres es una idea que se escucha todos los d as y que ha llegado a penetrar profundo en la conciencia de las mujeres de todos los estratos sociales este punto se da como un hecho apoyado en estad sticas generalmente falsas o bastante caprichosas a un n mero determinado de mujeres les corresponde un n mero equivalente de hombres a diferencia de la idea com n de que por cada hombre hay cinco o seis mujeres pero la soledad no es exclusiva de aquellas personas que son solteras hay mujeres que aun estando rodeadas de mucha gente llegan a sentirse muy solas y a sufrir de carencias afectivas tambi n entre mujeres y hombres casadas os que comparten su vida con su pareja es frecuente encontrar solas acompa adas para poder amar verdaderamente hay que renunciar a creer que ese sentimiento es el fin de la soledad y estar dispuestos a aceptar dos soledades la del otro y la propia y es que amor es confesar si yo te amo como tu eres aunque no correspondas a mis sue os y a mis esperanzas tu realidad me da mucho m s regocijo que mis sue os

2615587 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2615588 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense

2615590 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions

2615594 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2615595 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2615596 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market

2615648 gross community overdevelopment affirmative action loopholes and incompetent state government management of federal affordable housing programs
2615649 my father got held up at gunpoint while he was renting a car to a young african american man

2615659 the reason we have been largely unsuccessful in reforming mankind is that we have dealt with external matters rather than internal if we deal first with the matters of the heart the outward concerns will follow quite naturally
2615660 men have desired to love by formal rules and have instead lost much of that love there is no better way to learn how to love god than to simply love him

2615662 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2615663 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2615664 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2615665 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2615666 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout

2615676 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2615677 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2615678 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2615679 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2615680 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2615681 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2615682 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2615683 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that

2615687 one al qaida in iraq terrorist died when he detonated a vehicle borne bomb

2615696 we very much regard the pakistan afghanistan border area as the current hotbed of international terrorism
2615697 certainly what we dont want is an ongoing period of instability in domestic politics in pakistan
2615698 were very concerned about the pakistan afghanistan border area we think thats not just an issue to be resolved bilaterally between pakistan and afghanistan but its an issue that has regional international implications
2615699 we want to engage in a much more constructive dialogue with pakistan generally but also indicate to them as i have privately that we stand ready willing and able to offer relevant assistance to them as they come to grips with what is a very difficult circumstance in the so called fata areas
2615700 the point ive made to my counterpart the pakistan foreign minister is that however the pakistani government is constituted we think its very important for pakistan to understand that the difficulties that they find in the border area with afghanistan has very serious adverse implications for australia
2615701 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be seen to be the company that is still trying to implement work choices
2615702 in a democracy people who want to be a member of a union then the union has got the right to represent them and companies right across the country should recognise that
2615703 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be trying to squeeze the last bit of bitter lemon out of work choices
2615704 there are no new awas awas cannot be amended so if people want to move to new arrangements they need to move to a new industrial instrument
2615705 it will certainly say to telstra and to other companies that if a majority of the employees want to try collectively bargaining then the employer has to join them at the bargaining table and have a go at it in good faith
2615706 but the reality is i am contracted to the swans next year and i intend to fulfil that
2615707 while ill listen to any opportunity for the future my focus is on the swans
2615708 weve been approached by some nfl clubs to talk to barry to see if hes interested in coming over

2615759 it is a sad day when a minister of state can basically order them to investigate people and police comply with it
2615760 i am glad she ms salaitoga is now safe and that she has been released but i am disappointed despite our cooperation with authorities last night about eight police officers turned up at her home this morning and took her from her family
2615761 no consideration that her children were watching and that she is pregnant she had told them she would rather have a legal representative present before answering any questions and the fact that they chose to threaten her if she did not answer their questions is a matter of concern
2615762 we do not wish anyone in the community to be subjected to such a treatment this despite we were willing to cooperate with the police

2615886 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions the wind at the time was a south westerly force 5 7 with a moderate to rough sea state generating a heavy surf

2615889 im aware that researchers from the university of southampton have applied to plant some gm poplar on our land were still considering their request but havent given a definitive answer
2615890 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of they way the reproduce theres a huge potential for cross pollination it could have a really negative impact and cause widespread ecological damage
2615891 distract from the real solutions that we all know we have our concern is that biofuels will distract people away from other solutions

2615899 negotiating any piece of legislation through the senate is always a challenge
2615900 i have had discussions with some of the cross bench senators theyll continue and we will continue to argue vigorously for fuelwatch
2615901 this is really giving motorists the chance to call for a tender for their petrol and really the conservatives in the senate should get out of the way and let motorists have that opportunity
2615902 where medical ethics deals with the behavior of doctors in their professional lives vis a vis their patients bioethics focuses on the relationship between medicine health and
2615903 pages 4 5 this means that the hippocratic method of doctors doing what is best for their patients first in fact many if not most doctors do not even take the hippocratic oath anymore is being abandoned for the bioethical ideals of what is best for society

2615918 teen ink is a print magazine and web site written completely by teens for teens we dont have any staff writers or assign story ideas we simply accept submissions and publish the best work in our magazine and on our web site
2615919 admittedly what most readers leave for the writers they bother to comment on is praise usually wholly unconstructive because if they didnt like it they would either leave no comment at all or instead flame it leaving an equally unconstructive but negative review
2615920 one major advantage of putting fan fiction on the web is that it makes fan fiction incredibly cheap now anyone can write publish and read fan fiction from all over the world in dozens of languages

2615942 the shotgun wielding suspect in sundays mass shooting at the tennessee valley unitarian universalist church was motivated by a hatred of the liberal movement and he planned to shoot until police shot him knoxville police chief sterling p owen iv said this morning jim d adkisson 58 of powell wrote a four page letter in which he stated his hatred of the liberal movement owen said liberals in general as well as gays adkisson said he also was frustrated about not being able to obtain a job owen said the letter recovered from adkissons black 2004 ford escape which was parked in the churchs parking lot at 2931 kingston pike indicates he had been planning the shooting for about a week
2615943 officers recovered 76 shells for a 12 gauge semiautomatic shotgun inside the church among those shells were three spent rounds he had carried the shotgun inside the church in a guitar case owen said he certainly intended to take a lot of casualties the chief said adkisson is accused of killing two people and injuring seven others he is charged with first degree murder in the death of greg mckendry 60 also killed in the shooting was linda kraeger 61 who was visiting the church from westside unitarian universalist church

2615946 people really are selling their talent in a way that can make them money
2615947 they really know that if they work with the government theyll benefit
2615948 he went from being this renegade making films that were banned and an eyesore for the chinese government to kind of being the pet of the government in some peoples eyes
2615949 now the government wants directors to promote the countrys economic development
2615950 and the directors need money and fame and they can earn even more money with government support
2615951 most enemies of the people during that time fell into the category of the five bad elements
2615952 so those 10 years from 1966 until 1976 i lived under the shadow of tragedy and hopelessness
2615953 but he once told me that people are shackled by politics
2615954 i dont want to say much now but we spent the whole night sleepless because of that event i trusted zhang yimou i felt he cared for his nation
2615955 at the end of the film ju dou has a huge fire and that represents our emotion
2615956 if you insist on doing nothing to support the film but keep on delaying and cutting down the movie and eventually destroying it i cannot imagine how the chinese government and the whole chinese population will think of you and miramax
2615957 i truly believe no one could stop their anger you will be hurting not only me but also the whole chinese population
2615958 why would he continue to make movies that challenge the political system
2615959 for a century this is the most important time for the chinese to host all of the guests coming from all over the world
2615960 i took this job to a great extent because i wanted to do something for the chinese people
2615961 today was the best pace we have had offensively all camp roberto wallace is starting to stick out and have a nice camp aaron brewer our new long snapper is very good i want to give some props to both of whom are running well
2615962 noob prez allows convicted terrorist to be released after 5 months

2615964 the pentagon must be very proud of itself today it was able to obtain a conviction of arguably the least culpable among the 80 detainees it intends to prosecute as war criminals it convicted a truck driver of being guilty of driving a truck
2615965 executive privilege claims that form the foundation of the executives resistance to the committees subpoenas are not foreign to federal courts either
2615966 in the thirty four years since united states v nixon was decided the courts have routinely considered questions of executive privilege or immunity
2615967 is not merely an investigation into the executives use of his removal power but rather a broader inquiry into whether improper partisan considerations have influenced prosecutorial discretion
2615968 defies both reason and precedent to say as the executive does that the committee which is charged with oversight of doj generally cannot permissibly employ its investigative resources on this subject
2615969 unique ability to address improper partisan influence in the prosecutorial process n o other institution will fill the vacuum if congress is unable to investigate and respond to this evil
2615970 the 110th congress expires on january 3 2009 unlike the senate the house is not a continuing body
2615971 on the committees side the entire house and thus any outstanding subpoenas will lapse on january 3 2009 and the basis of this lawsuit will cease to exist to be sure the incoming house of representatives may elect to re issue similar subpoenas but that remains speculative at this juncture similarly the incoming executive administration may decline to pursue the assertions of immunity and executive privilege that form the foundation of this dispute
2615972 a former president may still assert executive privilege but the claim necessarily has less force particularly when the sitting president does not support the claim of privilege
2615973 as with the incoming congress there is no way to predict whether the new administration will support the assertions of privilege made in this case there is also the likelihood of appeal of this decision and given the significance of the issues involved a stay pending appeal is at least possible thus although proceedings before this court could be concluded prior to january 2009 any appeals process may not run its course before that date at that point the case would arguably become moot nevertheless the court concludes that this concern does not counsel against entertaining this case
2615974 lets get all this behind us so that the congress will not be fooling around with bush once the new president arrives
2615975 she wanted to try for a baby after the spice girls finished touring
2615976 but shes put her plans on hold while she sees what can be done to help her she knows she is putting her health at risk if she dismisses the advice of her doctors and has another c section

2615992 a significant amount of testimony was provided through the admission of a videotaped diagnostic and forensic interview that was conducted at the childrens advocacy center at saint francis hospital and medical center after the alleged victim complained about the sexual assault
2615993 a statement made for purposes of obtaining medical treatment or advice pertaining thereto and describing medical history or past or present symptoms pain or sensations or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to the medical treatment or advice
2615994 the medical treatment exception is not limited to physicians and has been extended to include social workers as long as the social worker is found to have been acting within the chain of medical care

2615997 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2615998 local military sources confirmed the incident and said the military forces have been put on alert
2615999 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2616000 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2616001 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear
2616002 i believe he can recommend charges or action be taken against the police as a whole as well as individual officers
2616003 the early stages of the investigation led by detectives in portimao really were very poor
2616004 a number of people had touched the window and entered madeleines and the twins room prior to the arrival of the gnr local police
2616005 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2616006 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2616007 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2616008 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2616009 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2616010 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2616011 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2616012 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2616013 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2616014 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions

2616016 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2616017 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2616018 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2616019 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2616020 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2616021 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2616022 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2616023 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2616024 the program is scheduled for thursday october 20 2005 at 1 30 p find the best rates here featuring a complete the truth about internet marketing
2616025 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2616026 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2616027 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2616028 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2616029 assaults on foreigners are rare in beijing site of the 2008 olympic games
2616030 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2616031 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2616032 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2616033 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2616034 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2616035 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2616036 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2616037 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2616038 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2616039 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2616040 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2616041 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2616042 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2616043 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2616044 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2616045 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2616046 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2616047 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2616048 under the circumstances it was a torrid week we learned a lot about people some good and some bad but we were able to generate enough enthusiasm and desire to play a good football side and win
2616049 i dont know about more satisfying it was good to beat a side that was 10 wins and eight losses when you are 9 9 because the overall context of the victory means we draw level with st kilda and have actually got our noses in front in terms of percentage
2616050 that is the pleasing thing about it and now we have got to keep our foot on the accelerator and approach next weeks game with the same intensity we had in this one
2616051 i was encouraged by the form of our leadership group and i said to them they really had to stand up this week
2616052 i dont think any ruckman totally gets over a pcl posterior cruciate ligament injury its always in the back of their mind but its just about taking away the pain and having the confidence to jump
2616053 but josh played his best game in 12 months and that is every encouraging because he is such an important player for us and he is our vice captain
2616054 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2616055 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2616056 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2616057 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2616058 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2616059 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2616060 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2616061 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2616062 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2616063 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2616064 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2616065 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2616066 just so you all know we did set a record
2616067 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2616068 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2616069 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2616070 im not afraid of the people its better to submit to the people than to certain domestic and foreign interests
2616071 we hope they find an agreement either before the referendum or immediately afterwards on just one interpretation of the rules
2616072 this referendum is illegal there is no room for a referendum in the constitution if the president looses he can call for an election but if one of the governors looses he will have to leave right away
2616073 the situation in bolivia is that what i do is legal and what my enemy does is illegal so right now nobody respects the laws
2616074 security as to how their votes will be counted and how the results will be defined
2616075 most people think the referendum is a distraction from the problems we have and i dont think itll change anything really
2616076 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2616077 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2616078 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2616079 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2616080 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2616081 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2616082 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2616083 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2616084 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2616085 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2616086 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2616087 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2616088 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2616089 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2616090 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2616091 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2616092 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2616093 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2616094 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2616095 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2616096 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2616097 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2616098 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2616099 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2616100 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2616101 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2616102 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2616103 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2616104 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2616105 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2616106 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2616107 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2616108 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2616109 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2616110 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2616111 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2616112 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2616113 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2616114 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2616115 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2616116 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2616117 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2616118 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2616119 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2616120 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2616121 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2616122 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2616123 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2616124 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2616125 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2616126 ese voto nos permitir nos obligar a un reencuentro de las autoridades a una reconciliaci n del pueblo boliviano y por eso la participaci n de todos y de todas es importante
2616127 reconfigura la correlaci n de fuerzas territorial y pol tica en bolivia
2616128 al mejor escenario para sentarnos a dialogar para acordar los puntos de vista entre el nivel nacional y el nivel departamental
2616129 el d a de ma ana domingo es decisivo para crear las bases reales de un encuentro de un acercamiento pol tico sincero entre las fuerzas pol ticas
2616130 se lo vamos ha exigir al presidente evo morales que el d a once tenemos que sentarnos para buscar una pacto de reconciliaci n
2616131 m s all de ser revocado o ratificado como prefecto santa cruz le va exigir ese pacto
2616132 nos entristece lamentamos esa medida que se ha asumido por algunos dirigentes c vicos pero no tiene justificativo econ mico ni regional ni t cnico
2616133 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2616134 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2616135 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2616136 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2616137 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2616138 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2616139 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2616140 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2616141 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2616142 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2616143 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2616144 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2616145 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2616146 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2616147 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2616148 what what was that i got that one you saw me i did
2616149 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2616150 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2616151 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2616152 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2616153 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2616154 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2616155 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2616156 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2616157 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2616158 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2616159 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2616160 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2616161 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2616162 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2616163 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2616164 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2616165 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2616166 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2616167 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2616168 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2616169 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2616170 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2616171 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2616172 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2616173 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2616174 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2616175 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2616176 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2616177 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2616178 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2616179 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2616180 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2616181 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2616182 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2616183 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2616184 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2616185 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2616186 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2616187 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2616188 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2616189 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2616190 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2616191 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2616192 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2616193 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2616194 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2616195 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2616196 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2616197 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2616198 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2616199 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2616200 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2616201 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2616202 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2616203 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2616204 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2616205 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2616206 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2616207 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2616208 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2616209 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2616210 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2616211 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2616212 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2616213 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2616214 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2616215 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2616216 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2616217 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2616218 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2616219 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2616220 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2616221 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2616222 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2616223 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2616224 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2616225 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2616226 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2616227 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2616228 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2616229 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2616230 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2616231 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2616232 at a place within the archdiocese of milan but as i infer outside the see city in addition to the mass celebrated each sunday at san rocco al gentilino
2616233 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2616234 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2616235 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2616236 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2616237 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2616238 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2616239 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c

2616243 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2616244 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2616245 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2616246 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2616247 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2616248 voc foi o maior dos meus casos de todos os abra os que nunca esqueci
2616249 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2616250 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2616251 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2616252 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2616253 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2616254 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2616255 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2616256 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2616257 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2616258 bring it on those kind of people are easy they say one lie after another hes a typical self hating ignorant jew
2616259 science can analyze a pork chop and say how much of it is phosphorus and how much is protein but science cannot analyze any mans wish for a pork chop and say how much of it is hunger how much custom how much nervous fancy how much a haunting love of the beautiful

2616262 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2616263 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2616264 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2616265 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2616266 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2616267 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2616268 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2616269 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2616270 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2616271 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2616272 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2616273 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2616274 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2616275 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2616276 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2616277 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2616278 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2616279 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment

2616281 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2616282 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2616283 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2616284 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2616285 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2616286 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2616287 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2616288 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2616289 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2616290 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2616291 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2616292 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2616293 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2616294 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2616295 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2616296 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2616297 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2616298 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2616299 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2616300 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2616301 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2616302 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2616303 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2616304 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2616305 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2616306 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2616307 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2616308 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2616309 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2616310 i will continue that practice should i become prime minister
2616311 new zealanders are generous people and john key is a good example of that
2616312 we have eliminated all the likely ones down to the point where there are not the records that are able to help us identify him
2616313 if we dont get any joy with the dna we might look at a reconstruction but that is way down the track
2616314 we are going to try everything else we will go down the dna path first and that will take a couple of months
2616315 if we dont get anything from the dna then we will make a decision whether or not we are going to go down the reconstruction path or whether it is going to have to be filed as a john doe

2616317 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2616318 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2616319 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2616320 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2616321 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2616322 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2616323 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2616324 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2616325 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2616326 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2616327 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2616328 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2616329 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2616330 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2616331 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2616332 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2616333 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2616334 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2616335 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2616336 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2616337 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2616338 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2616339 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2616340 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2616341 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2616342 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2616343 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2616344 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2616345 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2616346 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2616347 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2616348 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2616349 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2616350 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2616351 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2616352 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2616353 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2616354 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2616355 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2616356 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2616357 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left

2616359 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2616360 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2616361 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2616362 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2616363 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2616364 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2616365 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
2616366 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
2616367 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2616368 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2616369 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
2616370 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
2616371 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the

2616382 the supreme court held yesterday that the second amendment right is exercised individually and belongs to all americans
2616383 these lawsuits will ensure that state and local governments hear those words
2616384 this is a great moment in american history it vindicates individual americans all over this country who have always known that this is their freedom worth protecting
2616385 our founding fathers wrote and intended the second amendment to be an individual right the supreme court has now acknowledged it the second amendment as an individual right now becomes a real permanent part of american constitutional law

2616391 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
2616392 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
2616393 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
2616394 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
2616395 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
2616396 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
2616397 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
2616398 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
2616399 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
2616400 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
2616401 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
2616402 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
2616403 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
2616404 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
2616405 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
2616406 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2616407 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
2616408 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2616409 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up

2616425 when it comes to exceptional or extreme drought exceptionally high temperatures the historical assumption that this occurred once every 20 years has now been revised down to between every one and two years
2616426 now this is a serious revision of the impact of climate change on drought
2616427 therefore there is no credible basis for the claims of increasing frequency of exceptional circumstances declarations made in the report these results are consistent with other studies finding lack of adequate validation in global warming effects modeling and lack of skill of climate models at the regional scale except in the few cases noted above the model simulations have no resemblance to patterns of observed droughtedness in the last century we conclude the models have failed internal validation and no further testing is warranted

2616438 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2616439 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2616440 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2616441 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2616442 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2616443 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2616444 now kitten this town aint seen nothin good for a while now we lost the klan convention and the great tradition of negro chasin has died out since they dont even come through here now although you know as well as i do that the kracker barrel aint related to the restaurant convenience store is a mighty good place to pick up some youngins porn all legal of course things have been gettin a might bit slow
2616445 what an all do ya suppose we do bout all this nothin here in almont
2616446 well you know as well as i do leana that folks around here have certain well you know attractions what with those cold snowy winter nights an all when there aint nothin to do but sit around the fire place as a family sometimes a man can start lookin at his daughter with new eyes specially if shes just comin into that fine bloom of young wimmin hood
2616447 ah know how lovely it cayn be when you touch me down there daddy but people outside of our kin just wouldnt understand our practices
2616448 but they do understand good porn leana why there are scenes out there of ten guys lettin their load loose on some jap ladys face and they love it too
2616449 ass to mouth ass to mouth all of it sells these days
2616450 i figure if some little chinese girl can get attention from lettin a whole mess of folks gang bang her on film that we here in almont can git our own share of attention by puttin our unusual proclivities to use

2616453 especially when the wind blows like it was friday and is today
2616454 i played a great first shot then a perfect 9 iron from 140 yards it bounced in the front of the green but like the wind blows just in the moment and it went down to the water
2616455 then again i had tried to make a good shot but again a lot of backspin again to the water and after that i got mad and i played very disconcentrated not very concentrated the whole rest of the round
2616456 i was fighting for the lead of the tournament then i was just trying to make the cut
2616457 i have a chance tomorrow and well i have to wait
2616458 i dont know if its to bomb it as far as you can or get it in the fairway i dont know
2616459 it was tough during the suspension as i lost all support
2616460 he has been achieving this 280kg in training but the rules allow for a lifter to start with 20kg lower than his entry declaration
2616461 i dont know if either one of us has a lot to be proud of today
2616462 i think both of us will be looking to get some momentum in the morning hoping it will carry us through on whats going to be a long day
2616463 im just going to go out and play my game and give it my best shot
2616464 im putting better than i was last year which is good
2616465 the only real difference that i might have kind of forgotten about last year was that it is 36 holes and its so important to stay patient just because i think its easy to get frustrated or worried but 36 holes is a lot of golf and really anything can happen im just going to make sure that i stay very patient
2616466 i didnt hit the ball as well as i have been at the beginning my driver was going a little left and the rough was just so thick that it kind of can be a little trickier
2616467 this was a really neat experience her game really taught me a lot the fact that she is a long hitter now i am going to work a little harder to hit it longer too i was a little nervous playing against her side by side but from the very first tee i was confident that i was going to do well today
2616468 it was really hard because i mean shes my best friend
2616469 it was really weird but i guess it is what it is we couldnt change who i was playing
2616470 i knew it was going to be a really hard match today because i knew she was playing awesome
2616471 i had many chances but many putts stopped just short of the cup
2616472 my coach said if youre in annikas group during the final round ill drive five hours from oslo norway and watch you play
2616473 i hope my coach will be here although i will not play with annika
2616474 on some holes you feel it more than others on the 18th they did the wave
2616475 the only noise i heard was somebody getting hit by a golf ball and they were grunts
2616476 this tournament is not going to be won by 1 under par
2616477 its such a tough golf course that they dont need to trick it up
2616478 the fairways are running 30 to 40 yards the greens are like concrete its not enjoyable to play theyve taken an ok golf course and turned it into a lot of crap
2616479 if we had it like this once a year ok
2616480 but it seems like we have this 15 times a year
2616481 nothing is ever going to get as tough as royal birkdale you could put an asterisk next to it
2616482 when youre playing a par 3 you should have a chance if you strike a good shot to get it somewhere within 15 feet
2616483 the only way to keep it on the green is to hit 75 feet away
2616484 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2616485 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2616486 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive

2616489 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that

2616494 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2616495 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2616496 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2616497 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2616498 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2616499 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2616500 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack

2616741 these are the first gdp figures to come out and they anticipate a general setback in europe
2616742 even if italy is suffering from a more unfavourable situation than germany or france we have every chance of seeing a contraction of about 0 3 percent or more in the whole of the eurozone
2616743 even the german gdp expected next week is likely to show a fall of 0 8 percent
2616744 indicate a continued weakening outlook for all the major seven economies
2616745 the latest data for non oecd member economies tentatively point to expansion in china and brazil and a downturn in india and russia
2616746 this slowdown can be explained mainly by a contraction of internal demand with consumption depressed and a fall of exports weighed down by an unduly strong euro
2616747 these factors can only contribute to a serious slowing in the eurozone as the president of the european central bank jean claude trichet recognised on thursday when speaking of very weak growth in coming quarters

2616801 the need for a patrol station in hurriyah has always been there
2616802 it is such a huge area in baghdad for such a small number of ip
2616803 between the cfs brigade combat teams ptt and ip they determine where they want to put a station to increase security in a certain area
2616804 the new patrol station will now allow the local police to concentrate more on community policing
2616805 while allowing the patrol police to concentrate on providing overall security by patrolling and conducting checkpoints in hurriyah
2616806 when there is heightened violence and militia in a certain area there becomes a need for more ip in the area
2616807 iraqi community councils feel more comfortable with having ip closer to them
2616808 we feared some people would find out we were building an ip station there and they wouldnt like the idea
2616809 in the last three to four months security has really improved in hurriyah
2616810 for the most part the ip are doing their jobs
2616811 they are doing their jobs and they are getting better at doing it they are more professional and in the last 12 months they have been through quite a lot with the attacks in march during the criminal uprisings in baghdad and the truck bomb that killed more than 60 people a month ago in hurriyah
2616812 the truck bomb a month ago opened up the ip eyes knowing that the vehicle probably came through one of their checkpoints
2616813 reports are always positive of new police stations have helped detour violence in areas where they are established
2616814 it is always better when a station is put up in an area where it is wanted and needed
2616815 the ip are very inexperienced but they are asking for more training and they are willing to do the training which is a step in the right direction
2616816 twelve months ago ip did not do a lot on their own
2616817 now the hurriyah local ip station runs pretty well on its own we are hoping the patrol station will be the same way

2616819 motorists have utter disregard for pedestrians in the city they occupy the zebra crossing unmindful of pedestrians even when the red light is on as a result pedestrians cross the road when vehicles are almost moving which is dangerous hence we have recently started penalizing violators to give pedestrians the right of way

2616875 my object in living is to unite my avocation and my vocation as my two eyes make one in sight only where love and need are one ive toyed with quitting and just taking a year or two off to travel the world and explore its something ive always wanted to do and can afford to do financially but the practical side of me says its a foolish thing to consider you dont have to quit your job and explore the whole world at once plan two week vacations and select a small part of the world you want to see tuscany and florence london and outskirts paris and amsterdam etc put your practical and systematic qualities to good use planning your experiences if you could get away for a few days every 6 months youd have something to look forward to and something to talk about plus youd be absorbing new information about the world and about yourself does your alma mater have an alumni travel program that would be a way to meet people and learn new things you might have a botanist guiding you through the amazon or an art history prof leading you through the louvre good stuff you do get vacation leave dont you i just got a big raise and my feeling is complete and utter ambivalence i didnt ask for it or lobby for it i just got it and shrugged my shoulders i guess its nice but i dont really need the extra money i already make plenty well you must be bringing value to the company or they wouldnt have given you an unsolicited big raise companies cant run without good accountants sounds like you under estimate your own value and the value of the accounting profession if you no longer like the activity of accounting see a career counselor if you like accounting but dont like your work environment figure out what you dont like and seek to change those aspects or move on i can think of plenty of things to do with your money aside from travel my avocation and my vocation as my two eyes make one in sight only where love and need are one and the work is play for mortal stakes is the deed ever really done for heaven and the futures sakes

2616918 if the management of the games goes well i think it will have a positive effect on chinas global diplomacy and confidence of the government it will probably make them more receptive to international cooperation and multilateralism
2616919 conversely if the government receives a lot of negative media coverage and the games are mismanaged or there is an incident it will only fuel the more xenophobic and less cooperative elements in the chinese government
2616920 it will spread over to the world and become an international nightmare because china will feel humiliated and this will add to that suffering
2616921 china will feel very defensive about the human rights issue and if anything it will start paying more attention to this issue and why this issue has attracted so much criticism from the rest of the world

2616953 your father loved you your brother and you mother very much
2616954 well its the least i could do after killing the poor man
2616955 what did lazlo tell you you didnt kill them the daleks did that
2616956 and it helps it really does i just have to process this
2616957 hitlers in germany right now planning his invasions and his final solution
2616958 and in my time this wondrous city will experience another invasion we dont need aliens to help us destroy each other
2616959 frank told me about you building the lightning rod to hold off the soldiers in the empire state building
2616960 couldnt have thought of it without you and old mister franklin could i
2616961 but as lazlo said they were already dead thanks to the daleks guess it was a mercy to them you know i think i will take your advice and have my tea in bed get a bit of shut eye as the yanks say
2616962 the other choice would have been let those poor soldiers kill lazlo tallulah and frank could you have done that
2616963 you did not make their deformity just as you didnt cause that bomb that harmed those children the daleks killed those people just as lazlo told you
2616964 im no good at war we either victims or killers you create a victim you create a killer to protect him
2616965 it is what happened this time it is what i became
2616966 half an hour in the car isnt sleep its barely a cat nap
2616967 mmm true maybe ill go back to sleep what kind of pillow do you make
2616968 were going to clear the road and divert you you should be able to turn around very soon so you better wake up sleeping beauty
2616969 my dads shop this used to be jones and son tailors this was it
2616970 my great granddad it was his father started the company hed been working over at some other place before that
2616971 cant say i have or if i have i dont remember it
2616972 oh well it was a lot like that except willy mossop was a cobbler not a tailor
2616973 i started working here saturday afternoons and school holidays when i was eleven sweeping up in the cutting room started ironing when i was thirteen cut my first cloth when i was fourteen
2616974 made my first sale when i was fifteen it was a silk tie navy blue with royal blue diamonds on it
2616975 no call for bespoke tailoring not here not these days and we couldnt compete on retail not with the big chains
2616976 dad got a very generous offer on the building it seemed too good to turn down
2616977 even the freehold all of it it goes way back cutting room sewing room up until the fifties we used to make shirts too storage rooms fitting rooms a full laundry it was a big operation and there was a flat at the top mam and dad lived there for a while when they were first married when my granddad was alive course when he died they moved into the big house with gran
2616978 no well with the business gone there was no point keeping such a big house in the city and mam gu had just died
2616979 mam gu is grandmother my mams mam she died when i was sixteen tad cu died long before i was born he was a miner
2616980 spain just outside alicante theyve got a villa sea view pool the lot theres even a separate little apartment for gran
2616981 shes in her eighties but very independent she rescues cats
2616982 i know which is way you need to go to bed and get some sleep
2616983 get you an aspirin come on time to go home
2616984 of course i told you i was going to take care of you come on into bed lots of rest and fluids thats what the doctor ordered
2616985 owen never said that mostly he just stop complaining and have a drink
2616986 i know but if he was here now and could see you hed have said it come on you look dead on your feet
2616987 well not if you dont count dying that kind of takes it out of you sometimes
2616988 of course never wear man made fibres next to the skin
2616989 im coming back okay in just a few moments ill be back ianto
2616990 im not leaving ill come back very soon just hang on
2616991 no youre not just let me take care of you
2616992 come on let go ill be right here im not leaving you
2616993 a friend of ours a doctor he was killed a few days ago
2616994 and youre sure it was only seventeen hours between you being in the sewers and the first sign of fever
2616995 when you said youve been in the sewers with his symptoms weils disease is the most likely cause but ive never heard of it coming on this fast according to the texts there have been cases of early symptoms after only twenty four hours but that was in people whod received a massive amount of bacterium in the first place
2616996 a disease spread by rats usually when you come into contact with water infected with their urine we did find a deep scratch on the back of his left leg
2616997 its odd it almost looks like something clawed at it
2616998 im sorry but just who are you are you a relative
2616999 i could be any number of things are there any relatives you can contact
2617000 hes going to have some more tests and then a scan weve sent a blood sample to hereford theres a specialist weils lab there shouldnt take more than two hours by courier and theyll give us the results in 24 hours in the meantime well do our own tests here unless the scan shows us something definite like say appendicitis well treat him with a broad spectrum penicillin based antibiotic pain killers fluids and monitor him
2617001 there isnt much more we can do im having him moved to the isolation
2617002 until we know for sure we have to assume its contagious you cant stay
2617003 i think its a bit late for that besides im not gonna get sick i never get sick
2617004 not ever trust me besides if i have got it you dont want me out there spreading it about right
2617005 well it looks like you picked up some kind of infection in the sewer
2617006 thats okay you keep them closed for now do you want a drink
2617007 you have a bit of a temperature we need to keep you cool
2617008 i know that was painful you did wonderfully well the good thing is that youre here so weve caught this early now youre going to hate me even more than you do now but im going to prescribe you some eye drops and im sorry but they are going to have to be instilled every two hours for at least the next two days
2617009 yes if we dont do this there is a risk his eyes could become permanently damaged
2617010 ill have the nurse instil the first ones as soon as possible they will sting a little at first but hopeful as the inflammation goes down itll hurt less and less the blurred vision you have now will improve as well
2617011 you tell me about the life and times of jack harkness and dont say theres nothing to tell i looked you up
2617012 thats classified even you dont have access to those files
2617013 thats on the computer the paper files are still in storage if you know where to look
2617014 didnt i tell you no one knows more about that place than me
2617015 you did i should never have doubted you so what did you find in the paper files
2617016 that youve been working for torchwood cardiff on and off for over a hundred years and you really are a captain but youre not jack harkness he was an american serving in the raf a flight lieutenant who disappeared in london during the blitz presumed killed you did serve in the raf in the war under the name jack harris harris
2617017 well it could be useful sometimes i used to hint i was his nephew
2617018 typical anyway you did do some flying sutherlands firstly out of pembroke dock
2617019 and then oban you were on the same flight as the duke of kent when he was killed
2617020 fair enough after that you were seconded to the newly formed sas by 1945 you were a group captain then you went back torchwood but before that before the raf you were in the army twice once in india as a captain and then in the trenches where you rose to the rank of major
2617021 not many good stories from that time now since you already know so much about me how about a little sharing here how about you tell me a little more about the life and times of ianto jones
2617022 oh now what about that shoplifting conviction how does nice polite respectable ianto jones from cathedral road end up in court
2617023 oh that yeah well i was young and stupid and infatuated
2617024 he lewis he was the coolest boy in school and i wanted him to like me he had a gang and he let me join well more like he tolerated me tagging along id seen them nick stuff before then one saturday we were all in hmv and i felt him put something in my pocket i knew it was wrong but id seen them do it and never get stopped and i really wanted to be part of the gang so i didnt say anything
2617025 it was two cds of course lewis and his mates were nowhere to be seen the shop had a policy they always prosecute
2617026 dad was mortified said id let him and the family down gran told him stop being so self righteous then said something about the arms park dont know what that was about but it shut him up
2617027 she just put her hand on my cheek and asked if id learned my lesson i said yes and then she said then well say no more about it then she gave my dad one of her looks and that was that
2617028 so how did you end up working for torchwood london
2617029 i still wanted to be a tailor so after i left school i applied for an apprenticeship at some of the big london firms in savile row i got three interviews but no job right experience right attitude wrong accent if you ask me
2617030 yup decided to stay for a while see the sights got job in a dry cleaners rented a room then at christmas i was a temporary postman
2617031 after that i worked as a security guard in a warehouse then as a stockman same place
2617032 then back to the post office this time i was at a sorting office in docklands the manager kept me on into the new year to help with the backlog he said if hed had a vacancy hed have given me a full time job but as it was i had to leave then i got a job at a coffee shop just around the corner from canada square ended up as assistant manager the rest you know got the job at torchwood met lisa
2617033 your turn tell me what it was really like to live a hundred years ago
2617034 yes you can im right here well get through this together
2617035 theres been no deterioration since yesterday but we have a long way to go yet
2617036 im sorry i wish there was a better quicker way to do this
2617037 ill see about getting you some dark glasses itll make it more comfortable to open your eyes
2617038 ive got sunglasses in the suv i could wear them
2617039 they are still running tests but this seems to be some mutation of the disease there is no way to tell how it will develop or respond to the medication because it is a mutation and we dont know what to expect were going to move you to a private room in the acute care ward there is some good news
2617040 it seems to be very responsive to the antibiotics we are already giving you which is something the swabs we took from the wound on your leg indicate that was the point of entry can you remember how you hurt it
2617041 because it really does look like some kind of animal scratched you
2617042 the thing is a couple of years ago there was an incident right here in the hospital there was a thing i saw it like a person but not a thing that looked like it could do that kind of damage a thing that smelled like a sewer a couple of others saw it too but we told ourselves it was a mask a prank rare deformity something like that but it wasnt was it
2617043 of course you dont just like you dont know about the patients we see in a amp e every now and again mostly homeless or drunks they look like a pack of dogs has been at them but i know dogs and those bites arent dog bites
2617044 i think you need to give us a few moments of privacy
2617045 we had to move it it was blocking the entrance
2617046 oh no people who abandon cars at a amp e usually have a good reason its around the back where we could keep an eye on it
2617047 we thought it best what with the blue lights and the tinted windows
2617048 we picked it up and put it on a truck like we do when we clamp them
2617049 right well im very grateful can it stay here for a bit
2617050 sure you know everyone is talking about the tall yank who charged into a amp e with this kid in his arms
2617051 really the way i heard it hes just a teenager hows he doing
2617052 first i had to find the car i kinda left it in a hurry when we arrived it got towed
2617053 not as painful as before but youre still just a blur
2617054 it didnt take you two hours to find the car did it
2617055 the convulsion was caused by his fever but hopefully weve got that back under control
2617056 but were going to have to put him on dialysis
2617057 its preventative so long as we can keep any major organs from being permanently damaged he should make a full recovery although
2617058 this is a mutated form of the disease and you cant be sure
2617059 precisely all i can say is this mutation seems to have sped things up its like its on fast forward incubation in less than a day when it normally takes a week or more the first phase of the illness over in hours now hes in the second phase this would normally take a week or more but its been only 24 hours
2617060 so far nothing we are dealing with is life threatening in particular there is no sign of jaundice which is the real danger in these cases the symptoms hes manifested so far are painful and they need treating but so far touch wood everything is responding to treatment well keep doing what we do and you keep doing what youve been doing namely being with him being positive optimistic and upbeat deal
2617061 he he he says someone has him and theyre going to slit his throat drain his blood and eat him
2617062 no no thats all over they cant hurt you he cant get to you again not ever im here ill protect you ive got you youre safe i am your cariad
2617063 the doc wants you to start eating proper food now knowing hospital food as i do and believe me 3000 years from now it wont be any better im going to get you some real food what do you want
2617064 you need to eat how about some breakfast weetabix toast orange juice i can get the freshly squeezed kind you like
2617065 you cant stay hooked up to that thing for ever
2617066 if you want out of here you have to prove you can eat otherwise its hospital gowns and instant coffee
2617067 i got here this morning and nothing damn things in the cells were creating hell looks like ianto hasnt fed them in days it stinks down there comms are off no messages your phone is off sos iantos ive been going crazy
2617068 jack are you still there just what the fuck is going on
2617069 can you go by his place get some stuff pyjamas toothbrush clothes you know the kind of thing
2617070 why do you people call it that there is no treacle in it its made with golden syrup
2617071 people say british cuisine has nothing to offer the world but you cant beat syru treacle tart it is sublime
2617072 i dont suppose you could spare me a corner would you
2617073 believe me he looks a hell of a lot better than he did
2617074 any of it owen tosh this none of it is your fault dont blame your self
2617075 i know you remember it wasnt your fault gray wasnt your fault
2617076 i was meant to look after him i was meant to hold on to him i
2617077 was a boy just a boy running for his life you did your best shit happens
2617078 im the boss if my team get hurt its my responsibility i was the one that led ianto down in to the sewers and look what happened
2617079 we deal with weevils all the time this could have happened to any of us at any time
2617080 you cant do it all just because youre immortal you cant take all the risks for us life it about risks
2617081 but hes so young hes just a kid he shouldve been back at the hub making coffee and cleaning up
2617082 no he shouldnt hes not a kid and he can take care of himself same as the rest of us and you know it
2617083 i know youre scared but wrapping him in cotton wool isnt the answer
2617084 right thanks the doctor thinks he might be able to come home day after tomorrow
2617085 look since hes sleeping so why dont i watch him for a bit and you go and get some rest take a shower change of clothes
2617086 lets just say that you dont smell as good as you usually do and you look like shit
2617087 the doctor said you had to have someone with you
2617088 no way firstly i know you youd be putting out coasters and washing the suv as soon as my back was turned and secondly spending all day and night in an underground vault with a stream running thought it is not what the doctor ordered
2617089 we cant leave it unmanned every night and you cant expect gwen to be there twenty four seven
2617090 theres only one bed your bed and its not that big
2617091 it pulls out takes up all the floor space of course but it is much bigger and who needs floor space in the bedroom anyway
2617092 well you just hold those thoughts for later when youre stronger
2617093 yes sir captain sir holding lustful thoughts for later sir
2617094 i got to thinking and then i just had to check it took me a while to find it
2617095 i have to be honest i didnt remember going there specifically i do remember being measured for it small man with a moustache and a gold tooth
2617096 se voc daqueles que acham que as coisas s podem piorar ent o voc est sendo otimista demais
2617097 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2617098 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2617099 the border between georgia and russia in short has been the driest of tinder
2617100 russia warned us then that it will set a dangerous precedent for secessionist movements across the former soviet union including chechnya and georgia
2617101 what does all of this say about the future of war and conflict specifically toward the us
2617102 russias aggression is a consequence of well disguised and implemented part of the plan
2617103 russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2617104 10 russian aircraft had been shot down and 30 russian tanks destroyed
2617105 how exactly do you explain how the russian military a 3rd rate land force mobilizes out of their motor pools faster than the us army can deploy a brigade of the 82nd airborne

2617109 dan wickett is a readers best friend not only does he read and trenchantly review new work but he looks back to books that deserve ongoing readership ive lost track of the number of times hes led me to boks that i overlooked or never knew about and that were a delight there arent many reviewers i will let shape my library but dan wickett is one
2617110 well with the bigger department stores like that people may just go in there to get something even if they dont need it just to get the gift card
2617111 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2617112 we thought it would be better for him to get on the bus because its a far drive
2617113 now he keeps saying that he should have driven himself
2617114 the strike authorization vote demonstrates members solid support for their bargaining team and their strong determination to achieve a fair settlement with qwest
2617115 the truth is our leaders want a contract not to call a strike
2617116 the fact they did authorize one doesnt make it any more likely
2617117 were hopeful we will reach an agreement in a timely manner
2617118 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2617119 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2617120 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2617121 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2617122 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2617123 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2617124 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from
2617125 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2617126 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2617127 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking for 1 000 years russia has belonged to such a category
2617128 an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving of the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
2617129 as late as 1966 he khrushchev sent me new years greetings which astonished me because i was on the brink of arrest perhaps in his disgrace he did not know
2617130 i couldnt come back after that because i was so mad
2617131 i think it should be played from there every day its a much better hole but its still not an easy birdie hole
2617132 it has to be right i dont think no 6 here makes sense
2617133 ive heard all kinds of comments like hes wearing a lions shirt so theres no way he can win id like to prove them wrong

2617190 you have covered me in my mothers womb i will praise you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made
2617191 then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed you in the belly i knew you and before you came forth out of the womb i sanctified you and i ordained you a prophet unto the nations
2617192 filled with the holy spirit even from his mothers womb

2617198 first of all records really never left they just got pushed to the side because of all the hype on cds
2617199 we then find out that cds arent all they were hyped up to be and the price really never came down like they claimed plus they are digital binary sound
2617200 the record industry did keep pressing records during this time except it was on a much smaller scale people who still owned turntables from the middle price range to high end always knew that a clean record lp was superior to the cd in sound if the record was an analog pressing in which almost all are
2617201 weve had a retail store for over ten years from 1988 2000 and went to the world wide web and decided after seven years to reopen the retail store im glad we did because i have previous customers from the past come in and i ask them what they have done for the past seven years and almost all say they still been spinning their vinyl and are glad we are back open thats a dedicated customer also weve made many new friends world wide who love the sound of records over cds countries in the u k germany sweden holland spain japan australia etc are all pressing and selling vinyl
2617202 im so amazed that almost all of my customers know that vinyl records are analog and cds are digital plus they know the difference that analog is a continuous sound wave and cds are sampled and chopped up in bits this can get a lot deeper but i dont want to get into that but you can just google in analog vs digital and it will give you the true scoop
2617203 finally i can say that most of the major record labels are up and pressing again not everything is getting pressing but lots of great artists
2617204 vinyl lps analog sound is primarily the reason lps sound better than cds it all comes down to a true continuous sound wave length vs digital sound bits with a gap between each sampled bit the system you play your records on is very important and there are quite a few variables that play a role in the sound you hear power source turntable speakers and more all come into play it can pretty deep and expensive if you want to go for the high end equipment
2617205 from what i understand is that if we took an analog pressing and tried to convert it from its source to a computer it first must go through a process converting it to binary numbers so the computer can read it so i would say yes your correct in saying that digital sound is a binary sound into bits
2617206 actually when i first open my store in 1988 i promised myself and the store that the store came first it paid my rent and let me buy more inventory to make a better store so really i personally dont have huge collection for myself i do have my favorite bands such as the rolling stones the doors beatles and pink floyd you get the idea classic rock
2617207 i have a bachelors degree in teacher college and couldnt find a teaching job in the area back in the 1970s 80s so i decided to open a retail record store
2617208 thrill and adrenaline rush that i get while crate digging what are your thoughts about record collecting
2617209 its like an easter egg hunt for me im always thumbing through record stores while on vacation looking for that rare find
2617210 i seem to always see something from the 60s or 70s i havent seen in the past
2617211 the internet is the tough place to grade records because in the retail store i leave the record open for the buyer to inspect i try to be tough on grading because i hate to have returns on the internet we grade record amp cover as a m extremely clean looks amp sounds like a new record vg possible small wear but looks and plays close to new vg minor scuffs possible small noise but no skips and plays ok vg usually end up in my 1 00 section or the goodwill
2617212 i would say that classic rock is really the best right now from college kids to the baby boomers they all seem to be playing this genre jazz and blues hold their own but i have to stick with the classic rock
2617213 our online inventory is about 6 000 records we have added a few more but since we opened the retail store ive kind of got a little behind on the data basing of our inventory we have a little over 15 000 items in the store
2617214 ebay is fine for what they do but i really dont sell much there ive had a few of the high dollars items and moved them on ebay but i really dont sell any of the 8 00 to 15 00 records there i would rather sell them on our site at www backtrackrecords com or www musicstack com or www gemm com
2617215 one of the best finds was an original 1958 buddy holly
2617216 five years from now i see vinyl records still holding their own in the market
2617217 high end tube equipment seems to coming into the scene more and more
2617218 an audiophile record is mastered at better equipped mastering plants such as mobile fidelity classic records speakers corne and the like
2617219 regular records sound good on a middle range turntable high end turntables and equipment need high end quality records you are wasting your hard earned cash if you play a high end record on a low end turntable

2617222 today the bar group launched something genuinely substantial a four part speaker series on the application of law in virtual worlds that counts as continuing legal education
2617223 very often if there is one thing that i have learned in my thirty years in high tech is sometimes concepts are a little bit too early but when they do take off they take off with tremendous speed and efficiency
2617224 this where i think it is important especially for the business communities and the entertainment industries to understand what is possible because
2617225 i would compare it to the first stages of the internet if you look back to the predictions made by cisco and others in the early nineties and mid nineties almost all of them not only came true but ended up being even lower then we expected in terms of underestimating the market opportunity
2617226 so i think when you think about interfacing to your customers interfacing to your family interfacing to your peers and the communities of interest we will have both in our business world and our personal life i think we are at the very very beginning stages of what is possible

2617360 essa estrat gia deliberada de agress o chegou a uma interven o militar em alta escala envolvendo todas as regi es da ge rgia
2617361 as ive been competing more and getting my stride pattern down my times have gotten faster
2617362 i ran my fastest time of the year so that really boosted my confidence
2617363 being a veteran i know what i can do and what i need to do
2617364 what i did not know in 2004 was how to run the races to position myself for the finals i know i have to run well in my heats to get a good lane assignment
2617365 running through all the hurdles is my biggest goal ive had trouble with my stride pattern all year and im just getting that down
2617366 i havent run a clean race yet and thats why im so encouraged because i know i can still run a faster time
2617367 i know what i can do i definitely dont want to place fourth again
2617368 next time use clippers a little closer around the feet
2617369 she just gleaned head to toe you can see the white and pink on the knees and the tails nice and clean
2617370 its open to contest ants in the whole state but most are from fauquier county now only one or two dairy farms are left in prince william county
2617371 how clean they are how well theyre clipped just general appearance
2617372 a good holstein will give between 80 and 90 pounds of milk a day
2617373 and good jerseys will do the same brown swiss and ayrshires theyre a little bit less and jerseys give the most pure they give the richest milk it has the most butter fat
2617374 cows udder can hold 25 to 50 pounds of milk
2617375 i hope it wont stop me having another child but it does worry me
2617376 what light is to the eye illumination is to the mind
2617377 men seem to look at me and think she went out with
2617378 an unshakable premise the scheme of the conquest of mythos by logos
2617379 that olden times the world of myth unreflective life not yet analyzed away by consciousness in a society closed to nature the world of christian chivalry all these acquire a romantic magic even a priority over truth
2617380 the fulfillment of the enlightenment as the last step in the liberation of the mind from the trammels of dogma the step to an objective knowledge of the historical world
2617381 erects a weekly bastion against the commodification of time against reducing time to money reducing time to what we can get out of it against leaving no time for god or beauty or anything that cannot be used or purchased it is a defense against the hurry that desecrates time
2617382 i must emphasize that i am not simply praising abrams style i am making what i take to be a much more risky claim that a style that is good in the way abrams style is good not only tends to carry us with him it ought to it carries a legitimate warrant for the authors theses to write well in this way helps prove your case though of course it cannot go it alone the fact that if a subject whatever that means enables a critic to write well about it without requiring him to rely on easily separable blandishments and charm the mere production of hundreds of pages of well written sense about it constitutes as good a test as we have for his these if the theses were very weak we have a right to conclude a man like abrams as implied in his style would have discovered the weakness as he tried to write honest sentences about them and if he became dishonest and tried to fake it would somehow show
2617383 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2617384 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches
2617385 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day
2617386 road bike aficionados are much like trout simultaneously enthralled and mortified by anything shiny and new that enters their environment

2617390 ah ha theres the trick of the mind that makes it seem there is some spiritual reality

2617392 the abstractive operator results for mt he operations of the parietal lobe in the brains left hemisphere
2617393 exists to assign an emotional valence to all elements of perception and cognition
2617394 a man in new york is ran over by a car every fifteen minutes and boy is he getting tired of it
2617395 what is most important and what in terms of the inner life is more deeply and profoundly true the power of myth lies beneath its literal interpretation in the ability of its universal symbols and themes to connect us with the most essential parts of ourselves in ways that logic and reason alone cannot
2617396 alper uses a socratic technique to brilliantly and flawlessly argue that our concepts of spirit and god are derived from the mechanics of our brain enormously important full of scientific and philosophical truths
2617397 this is a miracle that people have this experience because it couldnt happen unless god did this directly
2617398 in appendix i and elsewhere in this essay i have spoken of unitive perception i
2617399 the measureless gap between the poetic perception of reality and prosaic unreal commonsense
2617400 in six months on jan 20 2009 we will have a new president but it is not
2617401 i start from a different premise i believe that the iraq war was a major
2617402 and then there are the more tangible costs the war has resulted in over 4 000
2617403 but these costs have already been paid nothing we can do today in june 2008
2617404 the surge has produced a considerable decline in violence in iraq general
2617405 he is right all todays gains could disappear when american troops leave and
2617406 as the iraqi security forces get stronger and get better then we will be able to continue drawing down our troops in the future
2617407 and i think that this transition of control and of responsibility primary responsibility for security is a process thats already well under way and based on everything that im hearing will be able to continue
2617408 there hasnt really been any discussion of numbers and its definitely based on conditions on the ground
2617409 are a lot more favorable than in december or april or even two months ago
2617410 we have clearly seen an increase in violence in afghanistan
2617411 at the same time weve seen a reduction in violence and casualties in iraq and i think its just part of our commitment to ensure that we have the resources available to be successful in afghanistan over the long haul
2617412 we will continue discussions with the iraqis on our shared goals of a reduced u s troop presence
2617413 an artificial timetable based on political expediency would have led to disaster and could still turn success into defeat
2617414 out beyond ideas of right doing and wrong doing there is a field
2617415 may the all powerful lord grant us a restful night and a peaceful death
2617416 huxley in hollywood the good the bad and the ugly
2617417 i was completely stunned heartbroken it was a blow to the stomach
2617418 here we are celebrating our sport at its all time high its never been this big this great to play this game world participation is in over 200 countries
2617419 but i dont believe thats a reason you look at basketball you look at gymnastics all those sports were dominant
2617420 theyve moved the mound back three feet theyve changed the ball from white to yellow so theyve done so many things and moved back the fences
2617421 in 2004 we out scored opponents 50 something to 1 at the same time we were hitting the ball so i dont think its the rules
2617422 its supposed to be about excellence the olympics is about doing amazing things
2617423 its too good of a sport not to be there you know numerous stadiums are built a softball field is not that big a deficit
2617424 for me if youre voting on something you should know what youre voting on
2617425 we need to get these ioc members out to games and have them look these girls in the eyes and see that theyre voting their dreams away
2617426 george allen told me i was too much of a luxury for the redskins to have
2617427 but i didnt think i could accomplish anything by going elsewhere you always believe youll be intelligent enough to know when to give it up but youre really not i had the itch to keep playing i still get the itch
2617428 george allen told me he wanted to go with billy kilmer and joe theismann in 1975 but kilmer wanted to be traded and if that happened george said i could stay thats when i knew it was over for me i had to live with it
2617429 maybe he can adjust but it wont be the same it never is
2617430 help ive lost my laptop and my thesis novel music collection that ive been working on for years please return the laptop ill give you money
2617431 but we think weve set ourselves up to be successful in both
2617432 it takes a toll on your body for sure and maybe sets you back a few more days than usual in recovery
2617433 they are making progress but the one thing you cant emulate is what it is like to play in a game
2617434 when we do raise it to that intensity they are behind a little bit with the soccer part and the physical part we are going to have to continue to work them hard to get them back to where they need to be they are still rusty
2617435 its going to be interesting how you get everyone back on the field now
2617436 life is not about waiting for the storm to pass its about learning to dance in the rain
2617437 guess words out how much better my press conferences are good to see
2617438 id just like to beat the guy for a change

2617441 in europe there is a greater propensity to consider something that is not from a traditional vendor

2617443 for shuttleworth ubuntu isnt just a business mission its a personal mission
2617444 porque yo no tengo donde publicarlas yo no tengo revista
2617445 do not cut the head of religion except with the sword of religion
2617446 i am like a royal falcon for whom the wide arena of the world for all its breadth is too narrow for flight
2617447 my brothers open the eyes of perception and look in order to learn a lesson arise from the sleep of neglect know that the islamic people were the strongest in rank the most valuable in worth they were very high in intelligence comprehension and prudence they faced up to the most difficult things with respect to work and endeavor later this people sank into ease and laziness
2617448 you spend no thought on this question of great importance incumbent on every intelligent man which is what is the cause of poverty indigence helplessness and distress of the muslims
2617449 it was afghanis genius to be able to adapt islam to radically new needs and conditions and to introduce modern ideas without renouncing or breaking with those with a more traditional outlook
2617450 the practice of reinterpretation of koranic texts by modernist intellectuals became very popular
2617451 that the belief in an omniscient prime mover was a natural delusion that arose when man was in a primitive state of evolution mans intellection capacities progressed after that however until they reached the knowledge that all these beliefs are kinds of delusions and confused dreams originating from mans fear of death and his desire for immortality
2617452 there is evidence that jamal ad din saw himself as something of an islamic luther and was moved by a conviction that religious reform was the only way to introduce material reform and self strengthening into the islamic world
2617453 if thou wilt not arise to help this people and wilt not unite them in purpose and pluck them forth by the power of the holy law from the hands of this sinner verily the realms of islam will soon be under the control of foreigners
2617454 in the name of god the merciful the forgiving today the use of tonbaku and tobacco in any form is reckoned as war against the imam of the age
2617455 thus an alliance of ulama merchants modernizers and the city populace had for the first time in modern iranian history engaged in a coordinated movement that shook the foundations of the government and forced it to change course
2617456 science however beautiful it is does not completely satisfy humanity which thirsts for the ideal and which likes to exist in dark and distant regions which the philosophers and scholars can neither perceive nor explore
2617457 we are just taking it day by day but so far it is ahead of schedule i want to take it day by day and practice more and more and just try to get back in shape and have everything ready to play
2617458 it has been positive every time i went to the doctor and i am very excited about the situation and the team
2617459 it has been unbelievably exciting time for the team it went all the way down to the last game to make the playoffs and it was tough it was even tougher to sit outside and watch you want to be in there playing but it is exciting
2617460 i will be able to just go out and play without hesitation or any restriction it feels good and i hope it continues
2617461 i dont think its in anyones interest whether it be telstra or anybody else to be continuously associated with workchoices
2617462 in het begin hadden we moeite om naar de juiste kleur te spelen na twee drie balcontacten leden we al balverlies op het eind van het duel was er eigenlijk geen sprake meer van een wedstrijd door alle wissels maar als je die begin en eindfase eraf haalt wisten we een half uur te controleren in de tweede helft zijn we meer gaan voetballen het was een leerzame wedstrijd
2617463 i came across a rosebush in one of my hunting trips some forty years ago there was one perfect yellow rose and the sight of it still in bloom bespoke something very significant not a day have i passed without having thought of its beauty
2617464 as if he had read the thought of his servant the king explained
2617465 when you dont think you have anything to write about just start writing
2617466 its a wonderful opportunity to stand side by side with locals in goolwa and other south australians and say enough is enough we actually need urgent action
2617467 its not good enough for the federal government to sit on its hands and say its too hard
2617468 to save the river we need water and we need it now
2617469 but the reality is i am contracted to the swans next year and i intend to fulfil that
2617470 while ill listen to any opportunity for the future my focus is on the swans
2617471 weve been approached by some nfl clubs to talk to barry to see if hes interested in coming over
2617472 we very much regard the pakistan afghanistan border area as the current hotbed of international terrorism
2617473 certainly what we dont want is an ongoing period of instability in domestic politics in pakistan
2617474 were very concerned about the pakistan afghanistan border area we think thats not just an issue to be resolved bilaterally between pakistan and afghanistan but its an issue that has regional international implications
2617475 we want to engage in a much more constructive dialogue with pakistan generally but also indicate to them as i have privately that we stand ready willing and able to offer relevant assistance to them as they come to grips with what is a very difficult circumstance in the so called fata areas
2617476 the point ive made to my counterpart the pakistan foreign minister is that however the pakistani government is constituted we think its very important for pakistan to understand that the difficulties that they find in the border area with afghanistan has very serious adverse implications for australia
2617477 i think we were too young to realize we werent supposed to be winning games
2617478 the fans adore the athletes who play in this city i never found that anywhere else maybe its because it was my first stop but i dont think so
2617479 just getting to go to the ballpark with eddie murray and cal ripken so it wasnt a downer for me
2617480 it was like all right my stuff really does work
2617481 to steal a line from top gun i needed to have my hair on fire
2617482 i wasnt awake until i put myself in a tough spot
2617483 right now im getting the opportunity to play and thats all i wanted
2617484 its hard to develop any consistency when youre not playing every day
2617485 ive told him you have a place of value if you accept what it is
2617486 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2617487 super duper ive been busy as a bee creating loads of brand new goodies for sale you can sneak peek right now on my
2617488 ill warm some water up and ladle it over your heads
2617489 yeah that was the night we all kind of gave up and just spent the night in our tents
2617490 sabemos que o ebay um timo lugar para barganhas embora neste caso concordamos que o conte do do pacote foi um tanto fora do usual e n s auxiliaremos em qualquer investiga o que a pol cia deseje fazer
2617491 let us suppose that the village barber advertises that he shaves all men in the village who do not shave themselves
2617492 i am trying to give you a paradox to consider that is why
2617493 ah but the barber only shaves those who do not shave themselves how can he shave himself if he is not a man who does not shave himself
2617494 it is not fair to move the goalposts like this master lu
2617495 if the barber cannot shave himself for logical reasons and if similar logical considerations prevent someone else from shaving the barber then logically no one shaves the barber
2617496 why the barber could be a woman no contradiction there or it could just be a man with a large untrimmed beard
2617497 i think you are missing the point of this exercise
2617498 perhaps he lives outside of the village and commutes to his barbershop that way he isnt shaving a man in the village
2617499 you know what i will rephrase one more time a male clean shaven barber who has the ability to grow facial hair and who lives in the village where he works places a sign in his window saying that he shaves all those men in the village and only those men in the village who do not shave themselves now in this situation who shaves the barber
2617500 you are not very good at considering paradoxes are you acolyte wei
2617501 it is funny master lu i was about to say the same thing to you
2617502 no nos marcamos un objetivo concreto en cuanto a n mero lo que queremos es que los racinguistas que quieran ser abonados no encuentren m s que facilidades buenos precios dos meses las taquillas abiertas uefa si vendemos 16 000 ahora bien si llegamos a los 19 000 en verano mejor por supuesto
2617503 empezamos bien el partido pero el cansancio nos hizo bajar el ritmo tuvimos un baj n f sico seguramente debido a que llegamos demasiado tarde al partido y no nos dio tiempo a calentar en condiciones las l neas estaban muy separadas y hab a otros fallos pero para eso esta la pretemporada para corregir los errores estamos ya muy justos de fuerzas y la verdad es que a uno ya le apetece volver a casa y tener unos d as de descanso junto a la familia
2617504 hoy a salido el partido bastante mal puede ser debido a que hemos llegado 40 minutos antes del partido tambi n el cansancio acumulado todo va haciendo mella la verdad es que no hemos tenido lucidez ni en acciones defensivas ni para llegar a la meta contraria tambi n sorprende que nos hayan sacado tantas tarjetas no hemos llegado a tiempo casi nunca asenjo ha hecho dos buenas intervenciones pero l sabe que ha tenido alg n fallo
2617505 si es para mejorar lo que hay habr m s fichajes
2617506 mi idea es viajar esta noche por ayer a la isla v a madrid y firmar mi contrato con la uni n deportiva
2617507 conocemos las intenciones de los dirigentes del aragua y me parece normal que quieran sacar tajada pero nosotros estamos muy tranquilos nos hemos asesorado bien en este tema
2617508 la verdad es que voy para all con mucha ilusi n y ganas de triunfar
2617509 as the burglars walked downstairs carrying an item they had taken in the burglary mcclellon from a hiding place shot mcfadden with a handgun
2617510 la verdad es que la noticia me ha pillado de sopet n
2617511 le he dicho al m ster que yo pod a haber sido el extremo que l quer a me parece que se ha tomado la decisi n demasiado pronto estamos muy cansados casi al 50 de nuestro rendimiento yo estaba seguro de que podr a haber empezado la liga como un avi n
2617512 ha sido una derrota merecida hemos regalado dos goles y el equipo ha jugado cansado sin tensi n y sin velocidad ahora se puede subsanar porque estamos en pretemporada pero en la liga no igualmente estoy enfadado el reus ha trabajado muy bien y ha hecho buen partido
2617513 billed as a streamlining move but it has raised questions of job security
2617514 i have questions about the legality of part of this process
2617515 if that were the case i would be very concerned
2617516 it stands to reason that you are not simply going to be able to fit five employees into four slots without having some mechanism whereby a fair selection can be made
2617517 we were hearing from people that they didnt have any place to play video tapes any more
2617518 it was happening more and more often equipment would fail and we could not replace it
2617519 at times we have had over 300 and that starts to be very difficult
2617520 they could decide that heaps of 8 pebbles are correct
2617521 and while ultimately theyd be no righter or wronger than us still our civilization says we shouldnt build such heaps it is not in our interest to create ai unless all the computers have bombs strapped to them so that even if the ai thinks a heap of 8 pebbles is correct we can force it to build heaps of 7 pebbles instead otherwise kaboom
2617522 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2617523 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2617524 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2617525 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2617526 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2617527 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2617528 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2617529 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2617530 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2617531 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2617532 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2617533 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2617534 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2617535 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2617536 hemos hablado con el chico y espero que lo haya metido en su disco duro
2617537 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2617538 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2617539 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2617540 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2617541 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2617542 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2617543 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2617544 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2617545 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2617546 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2617547 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2617548 who are open to doing something on the production side
2617549 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2617550 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2617551 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2617552 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2617553 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2617554 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2617555 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2617556 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2617557 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2617558 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2617559 whats this for are you trying out for a game show or something
2617560 if you do youll have to talk you know you cant just stand there and not say anything
2617561 hey he shouted across the room to another boy ake look at this
2617562 hey david check out this book this girl thinks shes gonna be on a game show or something
2617563 hey can you answer this what did the philosopher soccerts drink when he committed suicide
2617564 its pronounced socrates not soccerts simmons talked about him just last week werent you paying attention
2617565 nah its just a gymnast dude who looks nothing at all like zach
2617566 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2617567 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2617568 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2617569 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2617570 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2617571 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2617572 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2617573 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

2617590 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2617591 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2617592 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2617593 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2617594 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2617595 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2617596 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2617597 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2617598 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2617599 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2617600 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2617601 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2617602 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2617603 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2617604 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2617605 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2617606 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2617607 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2617608 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2617609 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2617610 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2617614 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2617615 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2617616 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2617617 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2617618 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2617619 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2617620 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2617621 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2617622 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2617623 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2617624 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2617625 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2617626 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2617627 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2617628 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2617629 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2617630 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2617631 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2617690 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public

2617698 maybe its five stars because my girl friend and i had a great time
2617699 i took brian glanvilles book the artist type from the library it seemed to sum up everything about the sophisticated life i wanted to live looking back the people in it were absolutely shocking a right bunch of shaggers and monsters but i thought thats the life for me and i guess it was really so ive got brian glanville to blame it is a brilliant very louche book
2617700 i had a brilliant childhood i was allowed to do what i liked i was an only child but from the time i was 12 i thought of myself as an older person born into a childs body mentally i was a 30 year old divorc e i just wanted to get away take drugs and have sex i wanted to be a bohemian my parents were very respectable great people but it bored me
2617701 in many peoples eyes what ive done has been a horrible way for a person to behave but i havent had a single moment of regret
2617702 ive got no interest in seeing my first son and im sure he has no interest in seeing me some people just dont take to each other im not going to lie about it id rather be a monster than a hypocrite
2617703 my parents were decent people my father was almost saint like and yet they had a certain element of antisemitism and they never met any jews i would say that the way my husband talks about israel contains an element of anti jewish suspicion and my husbands a wonderful person
2617704 when i see that jews can do things so well everything across the board from having shops to winning nobel prizes i think wow how fantastic
2617705 theres the old line that jews are communists and yet theyre capitalists theyre cliquey and yet they spread their influence everywhere
2617706 the muslim extremists are not hypocrites they really tell us how much they despise us its the guardian people who say oh no they dont really mean it it is incredibly patronising to claim to translate to us what islamic radicals really mean the guardian people say about iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad he doesnt mean it when he says he wants to wipe israel off the face of the earth hes doing it for his own people that some white guardian journalist thinks he can see inside the mind of man from a totally different culture is extraordinary
2617707 and they wanted someone to write about punk i didnt know a damn thing about punk black music was the only kind i liked when i actually heard a punk record i thought oh my lord this is not music this is just shouting
2617708 i had to pretend to be a punk so i dressed the part looked the part went to horrible punk clubs i made up a load of crap and said how great it was so i was a hypocrite at the beginning and now ive become someone dismantling hypocrisy my writing was terrible i got the job because i was 17 and working class theyd never seen anything like that before
2617709 tony parsons bothered me constantly and i married him at 19 to shut him up
2617710 jewish argument pushing at you all the time is quite sexy
2617711 coming from a stoic gentile household when i encounter people getting into a state around the dinner table it seems to me enormously attractive though when i first married into a jewish family and saw it happening every night i thought shut up shut up cosmo and i had a fun marriage a brilliant time but his problem is that he doesnt think hes got any problems
2617712 cosmos book makes his parents into strange anti heroes like victor meldrew he portrays them as awful people but they are so excited about the publication their desire for fame even in their 80s far overrides their desire for a good reputation
2617713 with lots of old people i play shuffleboard with them and take them out on the bus were all going to be like it one day i dont find it depressing at all
2617714 i see myself as semi retired i just want to be with my friends and have fun my dream is to just do my voluntary work as i get older

2617716 i just loved that place when i came back i was obsessed with living there and i made my husbands life hell for a month he said i dont want to go to tel aviv im scared of being blown up a few weeks later they blew up the carmel market
2617717 israels attitude to matters sexual is a breath of fresh air in a deeply rancid region
2617718 israel dismantles all the dirty prejudices fostered over the centuries of diaspora and reveals them as born again beauties standing proud in the sunlight of self determination
2617719 the jews are an exceptionally intelligent race a quick glance at the number of jewish nobel prize winners compared to the small number of them left in the world establishes this
2617720 no country ever boasted such a rainbow of beauty from the black skinned falashas to the blonds of scandinavian extraction
2617721 not for nothing does my enchanting collaborator chas newkey burden refer to his first trip there just short of a week as the six day phwoar
2617722 i cant help noticing that over the years a disproportionate number of attractive kind clever people are drawn to jews those who express hostility to them however from hitler to hamza are often as not repulsive freaks
2617723 the state of israel for all its faults is the only country in that barren region that you or i or any feminist atheist homosexual or trade unionist could bear to live under

2617726 you have to understand i have come into a new club where there are a lot of things different to what i am used to
2617727 it takes time to get the place running how i want it to its early days but these things will get sorted out quickly and we will move on i was at blackburn for four years and i knew exactly how things were done the lines of communication what have you
2617728 at the moment its not quite as it was at blackburn every operation is a different operation its a case of understanding that and working with it
2617729 weve had no bids for stephen this time of year people get ahead of themselves and interpret certain things i have spoken to stephen and he is fine with it
2617730 we are working to that end to conclude deals there is not that much of the window left but you can do business right until the last minute and that is what we will try and do
2617731 it was a great goal a fantastic finish and you saw his enthusiasm he is desperate to do well and play well he has got to keep fit and keep well and keep on the field of play if he does that he will be a real impact player for us this season

2617737 obama has criticized bush for his fiscal irresponsibility and now hes using bushs baseline as a yardstick by which to measure fiscal responsibility
2617738 congress hasnt agreed to extend the bush tax cuts because they dont have the money to pay for it
2617739 its not unreasonable to say were inheriting a budget thats going to have substantial deficits into the future
2617740 said a democratic congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity so he could speak candidly
2617741 leaving some of the tax cuts in place would cost us a small fortune
2617742 i dont know that any blue dog has a good way to pay for that

2617829 gab2 is a signaling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
2617830 gab2 performs a number of signaling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
2617831 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
2617832 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
2617833 as gab2 plays key roles in signaling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
2617834 our next step will be to obtain more structural information about how 14 3 3 shields gab2 once we know that it should be possible to design drugs to combat gab2 activated diseases in novel ways

2617836 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2617837 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2617838 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2617839 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2617840 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2617864 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2617865 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2617866 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
2617867 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
2617868 we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
2617869 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist
2617870 what clinched it for us was that the name mihai means who is like the lord
2617871 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer
2617872 many people think that the antichrist will be a evil seeming leader but in fact the bible tells us that he will be charming
2617873 ispo winter 07 will go down as a record trade fair in ispo history in addition to increased amount of area and number of exhibitors we can now also report a visitor record the increasing participation and the growing interest from the textile and shoe retail sectors confirm the continued development of ispo as a unique platform for the range of offers for sport oriented leisurewear in addition to functional clothes and clothes with technical features the mood at the trade fair was positive despite the difficult winter season manufacturers presented a lot of novelties at the trade fair and trade visitors were very interested in the new trends products and collections
2617874 ispo has developed very well and the atmosphere in the halls is full of positive energy i especially liked ispovision which has beautiful brands and products last winter i discovered orage for the first time and this winter i really like the collections from luis trenker and hell is for heroes
2617875 the trade fair was significantly better for us overall and the mood among retailers is better than expected we had a lot more visitors at our booth on the first two days especially on sunday we were able to establish a lot of new contacts especially to eastern europe
2617876 the mood at ispo was very positive above all the quality of contacts was very good and very international we were able to establish a lot of contacts to new customers especially from eastern europe usa and canada visitor frequency improved considerably overall
2617877 we had expected a much worse mood due to the poor snow conditions this winter but we didnt notice anything of the industry internal pessimistic mood described in the media to the contrary we were able to record a lot of visitors and got extremely positive feedback from retailers at ispo winter 07 the number of international visitors also increased for example more traders and customers from eastern europe and south america asked for information about our products we consider the tendency to all mountain topics and to typical niche products as new stimuli for example ladies collections are continuing to increase in popularity
2617878 unfortunately retailers are very uneasy this year due to poor weather conditions but we are still very satisfied with the quality of our contacts at ispo winter 07 basically all important traders and customers were at our booth so that we can speak of a positive overall result in the end with respect to new trends and ideas we were able to ascertain that the various textile brands are becoming increasing similar especially in the selection of materials at the same time this means that we have to concentrate more on technical details in our products we can only stand out from our competitors in this way in the long term
2617879 fortunately the trade public was not reticent despite unfavorable weather conditions for winter sport fans
2617880 despite the lack of snow we have had positive results of course retailers were a bit more reticent and cautious in the areas of ski and hardware than we would have liked but in principle interest is still there and the mood was very pleasant and positive our expectations were completely fulfilled and the quantity and quality of contacts were also very good we are leaving this event with a very positive impression we find nothing at all to criticize about the holding and conception of the trade fair as in the past years we are very satisfied both with our booth and the surrounding area
2617881 we had fewer visitors at our booth overall this year than previously but a bit more space always provides a better overview too and consequently we are very satisfied with the course of this years trade fair despite poor snow conditions the quality of contacts was completely positive in addition to numerous current customers we were able to establish a lot of new contacts and stimulate the interest of many retailers whom we really did not have in our planning previously we were also surprised at the completely positive mood in the industry as result ispo winter 07 has taught us that there are still chances for business deals even when the climate is mild and that things are never as bad as they look
2617882 the atmosphere at our booth was good in spite of the difficult winter especially because the fashion sector is not affected by that the demand and the need in this product area are very strong the quality of contacts is very good at the trade fair and we were able to establish a lot of international contacts and get new customers mainly from the usa and korea

2617886 we very much regard the pakistan afghanistan border area as the current hotbed of international terrorism
2617887 certainly what we dont want is an ongoing period of instability in domestic politics in pakistan
2617888 were very concerned about the pakistan afghanistan border area we think thats not just an issue to be resolved bilaterally between pakistan and afghanistan but its an issue that has regional international implications
2617889 we want to engage in a much more constructive dialogue with pakistan generally but also indicate to them as i have privately that we stand ready willing and able to offer relevant assistance to them as they come to grips with what is a very difficult circumstance in the so called fata areas
2617890 the point ive made to my counterpart the pakistan foreign minister is that however the pakistani government is constituted we think its very important for pakistan to understand that the difficulties that they find in the border area with afghanistan has very serious adverse implications for australia

2617927 el bar a no puede encajar dos goles en un partido y eso ha sucedido en los dos ltimos amistosos

2617959 retirada de las fuerzas rusas y georgianas a las posiciones anteriores
2617960 los ataques se producen en regiones de georgia alejadas de la zona de conflicto en osetia del sur la violencia amenaza la paz regional
2617961 pedimos el fin de los bombardeos rusos y que ambos bandos regresen al statu quo del 6 de agosto antes de la ofensiva georgiana
2617962 georgia es un pa s soberano y su integridad territorial debe ser respetada
2617963 ya es casualidad que despu s de tantos a os se decidan este verano a mejorar la carretera de tor
2617964 hace dos o tres veranos cuando la novela de carles porta fue traducida a varios idiomas y empezaron a verse por el pallars los primeros ingleses muchos con el libro bajo el brazo
2617965 porque en cuanto supieron que desde aqu no se pod a llegar al pueblo decidieron entrar por andorra
2617966 con qu autoridad el gobierno puede despu s exigir a los ciudadanos que cumplan con leyes de menor rango que el estatut
2617967 el presidente m s falso de todos los presidentes que ha tenido el estado espa ol
2617968 cuando en un estado de derecho se falla a la democracia y a la ley se est fuera de lugar pero si el que lo hace es el gobierno entonces es muy grave
2617969 si a alguien en catalunya le tiemblan las piernas que piense en el pa s y no en sus intereses electorales
2617970 la tentaci n permanente de ir poniendo palos en las ruedas
2617971 ciu est en un momento de cierta indefinici n y se siente inc moda a la hora de dar apoyo al govern en la financiaci n
2617972 siempre me ha preocupado mucho sobre todo porque es una herramienta que preciso usar ahora bien qui n es el responsable de ello creo que b sicamente los propios catalanes a la gente le da igual la lengua que habla c mo la habla e incluso si deja de hablarla catalunya es un pueblo que no tiene voluntad de ser ese es el problema
2617973 le amo tanto que me pondr a unos esqu s y bajar a desnuda el everest con un clavel en la boca si l me lo pidiera
2617974 por este motivo se cortar la circulaci n del lado mar de este tramo de la avenida la finalizaci n de las obras est prevista para el mes de diciembre del 2009
2617975 como una obra en casa porque se sabe cuando llegan los obreros pero no cu ndo se van

2618000 esa diferencia no es nada puede explicarse por la diferencia de puntuaciones que existen entre la competici n de la ma ana y la de la tarde
2618001 salimos todos desde la misma posici n estamos bastante igualados lo m s importante en una final ser hacer un ejercicio limpio y t cnicamente perfecto es en lo que habr que poner m s empe o
2618002 gervi ha estado como se esperaba y ha logrado una marca muy parecida a la que le dio la medalla de plata en el ltimo mundial
2618003 hab a llegado un poco preocupado porque hasta ahora no hab a bajado del 1 15 para completarlo pero hoy me han sobrado 2 o 3 segundos y eso es buena se al es un margen de tiempo muy f cil de ajustar para nosotros
2618004 me alegro por la final de gervi porque ha logrado su objetivo pero creo que he hecho mejor ejercicio que l
2618005 si no para superarle para hacer una buena nota y no me la han dado lo he hecho bastante bien como para meterme en final tranquilamente y por eso estoy decepcionado

2618053 bagi allah dan bagi kitab nya bagi rasul nya bagi imam imam kaum muslimin dan mereka kaum muslimin pada umumnya
2618054 dan orang orang yang berjihad untuk mencari keridhaan kami benar benar akan kami tunjukkan kepada mereka jalan jalan kami
2618055 dari mana atas dasar apa pent kita mendatangkan manhaj salafus shalih
2618056 dan barangsiapa yang menentang rasul sesudah jelas kebenaran baginya dan mengikuti jalan selain jalannya orang orang mukmin kami palingkan dia kemana dia berpaling dan kami masukkan dia ke dalam jahanam dan jahanam itu seburuk buruk tempat kembali
2618057 dan barangsiapa yang menentang rasul sesudah jelas kebenaran baginya kami palingkan dia kemana dia berpaling dan kami masukkan dia ke dalam jahanam
2618058 kemudian jika kamu berlainan pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada allah al quran dan rasul nya as sunnah jika kamu benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir yang demikian itu lebih utama bagimu dan lebih baik akibatnya
2618059 dan bahwa yang kami perintahkan ini adalah jalan ku yang lurus maka ikutilah dia dan jangan kamu mengikuti jalan jalan yang lain karena jalan jalan itu menceraiberaikan kamu dari jalan nya
2618060 sesungguhnya jalan yang bisa menuju pada allah subhanahu wa taala adalah satu dan jalan jalan yang lain adalah jalan jalan yang menjauhkan kaum muslimin dari jalan allah subhanahu wa taala
2618061 dan kami turunkan kepadamu al quran agar kamu menerangkan kepada umat manusia apa yang telah diturunkan kepada mereka
2618062 al quran bila diibaratkan dengan sistem peraturan buatan manusia adalah seperti undang undang dasar dan as sunnah bila diibaratkan dengan sistem peraturan buatan manusia adalah seperti penjelasan terhadap undang undang dasar tersebut
2618063 dan bahwa yang kami perintahkan ini adalah jalan ku yang lurus maka ikutilah dia dan jangan kamu mengikuti jalan jalan yang lain karena jalan jalan itu menceraiberaikan kamu dari jalan nya
2618064 dan bahwa yang kami perintah ini adalah jalan ku yang lurus maka ikutilah dia dan jangan kamu mengikuti jalan jalan yang lain karena jalan jalan itu menceraiberaikan kamu dari jalan nya
2618065 ini adalah jalan jalan dan pada setiap pangkal jalan itu ada syaithan yang menyeru manusia padanya
2618066 yahudi terpecah menjadi 71 golongan dan nashrani telah terpecah menjadi 72 golongan dan sesungguhnya umatku akan terpecah menjadi 73 golongan semuanya ada di neraka kecuali satu
2618067 dia adalah apa yang aku dan shahabatku berada di atasnya
2618068 dan barangsiapa yang menentang rasulullah sesudah jelas kebenaran baginya dan mengikuti jalan yang bukan jalan orang orang mukmin
2618069 aku tinggalkan bagi kalian dua perkara yang kalian tidak akan tersesat selama berpegang teguh dengan keduanya yakni kitabullah dan sunnahku dan tidaklah terpisah keduanya al quran dan as sunnah sampai keduanya datang kepadaku di haudl
2618070 ya rasulullah seakan akan ini adalah nasehat perpisahan maka berilah kami wasiat
2618071 aku wasiatkan kepada kamu sekalian untuk tetap bertakwa kepada allah azza wa jalla dan senantiasa mendengar dan taat walaupun yang memimpin kalian adalah seorang budak barangsiapa hidup berumur panjang di antara kalian niscaya dia akan melihat perselisihan yang banyak oleh karena itu wajib atas kalian berpegang teguh dengan sunnahku dan sunnah khulafaur rasyidin yang mendapat petunjuk yang datang sesudahku gigitlah sunnah itu dengan gigi geraham kalian dan jauhilah perkara perkara baru yang diada adakan dalam urusan agama pent karena sesungguhnya setiap perkara yang baru itu bidah dan setiap bidah itu sesat dan setiap kesesatan itu di neraka
2618072 barangsiapa di antara kalian yang hidup berumur panjang setelahku maka dia akan melihat perselisihan yang banyak
2618073 dan ketika dikatakan pada mereka supaya jangan berbuat kerusakan di muka bumi ini dengan perbuatannya mereka berkata tapi kami adalah orang orang yang mengadakan perbaikan tapi sesungguhnya mereka adalah pembuat kerusakan namun mereka tidak menyadarinya
2618074 simpanlah dulu usaha usaha dakwah semacam itu di rak rak kalian sampai situasi politik kita memperbaikinya
2618075 karena orang orang kuffar itu telah merebut tanah tanah kaum muslimin
2618076 tidak ada yang salah padamu ini semua adalah tanggung jawab orang orang kuffar sehingga semua ini terjadi karena mereka menolak hukum allah
2618077 jika kamu tidak berusaha untuk menegakkan khilafah maka kamu musyrik
2618078 ini bukanlah saatnya untuk melakukan dakwah kepada hal tersebut sekarang
2618079 hal terpenting sekarang adalah usaha untuk menegakkan kembali khilafah sedangkan memanjang jenggot adalah perkara qusyur kulit yang dapat kita buang
2618080 setiap nash yang ada dalam al quran dan al hadits maka tidaklah para ulama itu kecuali saling ber ikhtilaf dalam memahaminya
2618081 dan tidaklah allah menciptakan manusia dan jin kecuali untuk menegakkan khilafah dan menegakkan hukum hukum islam
2618082 sesungguhnya allah tidak akan merubah keadaan suatu kaum sampai mereka menegakkan khilafah
2618083 kami pergi ke iran dan mengusulkan agar khomeini menjadi khalifah umat ini
2618084 bukan berarti khomeini itu tidak mempunyai kesalahan tapi sekarang ini bukanlah waktunya untuk membahas hal itu tapi pergunakanlah waktu itu untuk hal lain
2618085 kami telah pergi menemui khomeini dan menyerukan padanya agar menjadi khalifah dan khomeini pun mengatakan bahwa dia akan memberikan jawabannya pada kita apakah dia bersedia atau tidak
2618086 kami telah menunggu untuk jawabannya itu tetapi kami tidak mendapatkannya dia tidak memberikan jawaban
2618087 sesungguhnya allah tidak akan merubah keadaan suatu kaum sampai kaum itu merubahnya ar rad 11
2618088 kami atau kita umat islam jatuh karena ketidakpatuhanmu pada allah
2618089 allah telah menjanjikan kepada kita umat islam kejayaan dan kemenangan lalu kenapa setelah dia memberikan hal itu kemudian menghancurkan kita mereka tidak akan menjawabnya
2618090 jika kalian bersabar dan bertaqwa maka yang demikian itu sungguh merupakan hal yang patut diutamakan
2618091 ya allah jauhkanlah aku dari setiap bala yang timbul akibat dosa dosa
2618092 berhentilah memakai hal hal yang berbau emosional itu dalam berdakwah dan mulailah untuk mengajari umat ini dengan apa yang harus pertama kali mereka ketahui yaitu at tauhid
2618093 pertama salah satu prinsip kami adalah mencari dukungan kepada kuffar agar mereka memberikan bantuan kepada kita dalam menegakkan khilafah maka pada tahun 1978 mereka meminta kepada qaddafi agar membantunya dalam menegakkan khilafah
2618094 baik kita katakan pada mereka kau bersama kami walaupun kau tidak shalat
2618095 subhanallah dia berjuang melawan syaithan terbesar yaitu amerika maka kami bersamanya
2618096 bagi allah dan bagi kitab nya bagi rasul nya bagi imam imam kaum muslimin dan mereka kaum muslimin pada umumnya
2618097 dan orang orang yang berjihad untuk mencari keridhaan kami benar benar akan kami tunjukkan kepada mereka jalan jalan kami
2618098 dari mana atas dasar apa pent kita mendatangkan manhaj salafus shalih
2618099 dan barangsiapa yang menentang rasul sesudah jelas kebenaran baginya dan mengikuti jalan selain jalannya orang orang mukmin kami palingkan dia kemana dia berpaling dan kami masukkan dia ke dalam jahanam dan jahanam itu seburuk buruk tempat kembali
2618100 dan barangsiapa yang menentang rasul sesudah jelas kebenaran baginya kami palingkan dia kemana dia berpaling dan kami masukkan dia ke dalam jahanam
2618101 kemudian jika kamu berlainan pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada allah al quran dan rasul nya as sunnah jika kamu benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir yang demikian itu lebih utama bagimu dan lebih baik akibatnya
2618102 dan bahwa yang kami perintahkan ini adalah jalan ku yang lurus maka ikutilah dia dan jangan kamu mengikuti jalan jalan yang lain karena jalan jalan itu menceraiberaikan kamu dari jalan nya
2618103 sesungguhnya jalan yang bisa menuju pada allah subhanahu wa taala adalah satu dan jalan jalan yang lain adalah jalan jalan yang menjauhkan kaum muslimin dari jalan allah subhanahu wa taala
2618104 dan kami turunkan kepadamu al quran agar kamu menerangkan kepada umat manusia apa yang telah diturunkan kepada mereka
2618105 al quran bila diibaratkan dengan sistem peraturan buatan manusia adalah seperti undang undang dasar dan as sunnah bila diibaratkan dengan sistem peraturan buatan manusia adalah seperti penjelasan terhadap undang undang dasar tersebut
2618106 dan bahwa yang kami perintahkan ini adalah jalan ku yang lurus maka ikutilah dia dan jangan kamu mengikuti jalan jalan yang lain karena jalan jalan itu menceraiberaikan kamu dari jalan nya
2618107 dan bahwa yang kami perintah ini adalah jalan ku yang lurus maka ikutilah dia dan jangan kamu mengikuti jalan jalan yang lain karena jalan jalan itu menceraiberaikan kamu dari jalan nya
2618108 ini adalah jalan jalan dan pada setiap pangkal jalan itu ada syaithan yang menyeru manusia padanya
2618109 yahudi terpecah menjadi 71 golongan dan nashrani telah terpecah menjadi 72 golongan dan sesungguhnya umatku akan terpecah menjadi 73 golongan semuanya ada di neraka kecuali satu
2618110 dia adalah apa yang aku dan shahabatku berada di atasnya
2618111 dan barangsiapa yang menentang rasulullah sesudah jelas kebenaran baginya dan mengikuti jalan yang bukan jalan orang orang mukmin
2618112 aku tinggalkan bagi kalian dua perkara yang kalian tidak akan tersesat selama berpegang teguh dengan keduanya yakni kitabullah dan sunnahku dan tidaklah terpisah keduanya al quran dan as sunnah sampai keduanya datang kepadaku di haudl
2618113 ya rasulullah seakan akan ini adalah nasehat perpisahan maka berilah kami wasiat

2618115 barangsiapa di antara kalian yang hidup berumur panjang setelahku maka dia akan melihat perselisihan yang banyak
2618116 masyarakat itu akan tegak dengan keduanya aqidah dan akhlaqul karimah dan islam menyerukan pada keduanya
2618117 kami membolehkan orang orang untuk membentuk hizb hizb berdasarkan pada firman allah
2618118 kamu adalah umat terbaik yang dilahirkan untuk manusia yang menyeru pada kebaikan dan melarang kejelekan serta beriman kepada allah
2618119 dan inilah yang terjadi antara kalangan sunni dengan syii yang sebenarnya ada orang orang yang berada di belakang perpecahan ini yang mempunyai maksud tertentu dan kami harus memerangi orang orang itu sebab tidak ada perbedaan antara keduanya dan siapa saja yang melakukan perbedaan itu maka akan kami lawan
2618120 sesungguhnya amar maruf nahi munkar tidak bisa dijalankan kecuali sebelumnya telah ditegakkan khilafah dan hukum hukum islam
2618121 dan hendaklah ada di antara kamu segolongan umat yang menyeru pada kebajikan menyeru yang maruf dan mencegah dari yang munkar mereka lah orang orang yang beruntung
2618122 tanah yang ditempati muslimin sekarang adalah darul kufr walaupun orang orang yang menempatinya muslim
2618123 semua orang selain yang tinggal di makkah dan madinah adalah bukan muslim dan wilayah tempat tinggal mereka yang tinggali pun bukanlah darul islam ad daulah islamiyyah halaman 55 mitsaqul ummah halaman 14 dan 44 manhaj hizbut tahrir halaman 10 11
2618124 andaikata kepala salah seorang dari kalian ditusuk dengan jarum besi maka itu lebih baik baginya daripada menyentuh wanita yang tak halal baginya
2618125 salah satu hukum allah adalah tidak berjabat tangan dengan wanita bukan mahram jika kalian tidak berhukum dengan hukum allah maka kalian tidak akan bisa menegakkan hukum allah

2618156 ahora me doy cuenta de que pascal es como un lejano sobrino de am rica alguien a quien no conoces realmente
2618157 y solo me enter de su ruta 68 comer en los 68 restaurantes del mundo con tres estrellas michelin tres o cuatro d as antes de que empezara el tour gastron mico
2618158 a n corro aspirando el aroma tras un autob s
2618159 a n corro aspirando el aroma tras un autob s
2618160 al pisar la ciudad el fr o me coge por sorpresa
2618161 todav a los espa oles cre s que lo nuestro es vuestro
2618162 si les para alguien como yo nada de hablar ni de dar confianzas ni decir de d nde sos ni cu nta plata llev is
2618163 a n corro aspirando el aroma tras un autob s
2618164 hemos dejado la mayor a los que obligan a tener agenda responsabilidad presentar planes o estudios seguimos con nh lavazza borges juli y yo decidimos que en el 2008 se iban a acabar los negocios por obligaci n pero queremos cuidar al equipo y fruto de esa preocupaci n nace la cerveza inedit con damm obra de juli con los sumilleres ferran centelles y david sitj o las texturas de albert adri si ahora puedo viajar m s es porque casi estoy retirado de los negocios
2618165 el bulli tiene que crear caos no podemos caer en la rutina es un monstruo muy complicado incontrolable y seguiremos dando solo cenas nadie va al teatro al mediod a concibo el restaurante como una ceremonia nocturna
2618166 lo haremos lo estamos hablando estuvimos all cuatro d as en primavera y nos pareci muy interesante
2618167 a n corro aspirando el aroma tras un autob s
2618168 muy a menudo el viajero tiene la sensaci n de estar m s en un continente que en una isla
2618169 el paisaje cretense se parece a la buena prosa bien trabajado sobrio exento de riquezas superfluas poderoso y contenido
2618170 ten a aspecto de haber viajado mucho de simbad el marino
2618171 un coraz n vivo una gran alma en bruto no cultivada unida todav a por el cord n umbilical a su madre la tierra
2618172 a n corro aspirando el aroma tras un autob s
2618173 no podemos caer en la rutina hay que buscar nuevos retos y queremos trabajar el producto de oto o no s qu pasar en el 2010 aunque la previsi n es abrir en invierno y seguir as cuatro o cinco a os
2618174 un trabajo que cambiar la cocina no tiene nada que con lo visto hasta ahora ha querido mostrar la belleza del oficio
2618175 es un viaje creativo para teorizar ver 50 000 cosas comer me explicar n vendr oriol castro y nos acercaremos al amazonas
2618176 pr cticamente somos extranjeros en nuestra propia tierra en nuestro pa s hoy en d a m s de 35 mil ind genas migrantes que vivimos en la zona metropolitana hemos venido aqu a buscar una mejor alternativa y condiciones de vida
2618177 sin embargo estos derechos pr cticamente son pisoteados d a a d a por parte de diferentes autoridades de diferentes niveles de gobierno por esa raz n nos hemos estado organizando los ind genas migrantes con el fin de buscar alternativas para que nuestros hijos puedan estudiar en una universidad
2618178 queremos hacer convenio con los gobiernos de los estados de origen por ejemplo simplemente en la cuesti n de la certeza jur dica para sacar un acta de nacimiento de sus hijos se las piden y muchos de ellos no las tienen podemos hacer el tr mite ac junto con el registro civil de gobierno del estado sin embargo eso tiene un costo y qui n lo va a pagar
2618179 this is downright criminal the government should get involved its like being forced to spend 10 on a deniro movie where he does 30 of the scenes and a stand in takes over
2618180 breaststroke this is the closest thing phelps has to a chink in his individual medley armor its the only stroke hes not capable of dominating but hes hardly bad at it

2618185 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
2618186 theres just a tremendous sense of gratitude for the blessing that god has given to the work and for all those whove helped to make it possible it has just turned out to be something much more than i ever imagined but i can see how the hand of god has been at work in it throughout
2618187 why our lady of guadalupe because our blessed mother this is her appearance on our continent in mexico city but she made it very clear when she appeared to st juan diego that she was coming for all the children of america
2618188 im deeply convinced that she will draw all of america together and integrate or unity help us to overcome any kind of racial prejudice or hatred there might be and to form a stronger american continent
2618189 i believe it will become a major shrine in the u s with time i just think because of the attraction of our lady of guadalupe and because of the very beauty of this area and the very shrine itself that many will come here on pilgrimage
2618190 could the 25 million better spent its very typical of shrines to inspire in pilgrims a deeper devotion to the churchs works of charity and to our educational mission so to those who somehow believe that this shrine has somehow taken away something from those missions i would just ask them to look again and see no in fact it will inspire those missions very much more
2618191 all i can say is the shrine has no debt it has a firm principal it doesnt borrow money it only does what it can through the donations of those who are devoted to the work so well continue to develop as we have the gifts to do it
2618192 i managed a book store in a seminary in the vatican i was a seminarian at the time studying preparing for ordination but i also served in the vatican from sept 1989 to feb 1995 and im going back to serve in the same office
2618193 im very humbled and grateful for the holy fathers confidence in me and i will do my best to serve him
2618194 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

2618205 that she is glad that there are more voices being added to the political discourse in america
2618206 im a huge fan of political diversity whether or not they get a lot of votes american democracy should have a lot of depth
2618207 we are also aiming to expand the reach of the green party beyond its traditional base with the goal of obtaining five percent of the national vote which would propel the green party to major political party status
2618208 it is in the interest of the other two major parties to put the green party in a box and say they are only interested in the environment but the green party has taken a stand for reparations and for descendants of the enslaved in this country they have taken a stand against police brutality and racial profiling they have acknowledged the fact that this country was built on genocide of the indigenous people in this country so the green party is also a justice party a peace party a democracy party of course it is a party for respect for this planet that gives us life but that is not all that this party is

2618214 but after a couple of hours of pointless torture it occurred to me that i was behaving like a stage mother instead of enjoying my offsprings success and being proud of her achievements i was dwelling on how i might have done it differently no wonder directors are notoriously reluctant to have authors on the set

2618328 the campaign faltered with his premature death but in the last couple of years it has been resurrected by irb officials syd millar and mike miller
2618329 the irb entourage is in beijing there is a level of confidence that there is a reasonable chance rugby will be reinstated for the 2016 olympics and a real possibility it will be an exhibition sport in 2012

2618373 la batalla de trevi o est pura y eso es bien importante para una obra que tiene m s de cien a os
2618374 el cuadro nunca hab a salido de europa hasta que vino por un corto periodo de tiempo para la exhibici n ac como parte de la subasta de arte latinoamericano s lo le hicimos una leve limpieza de polvo porque estaba en un estado exquisito
2618375 el proceso de limpieza no es invasivo no altera nada s lo se remueven part culas de polvo y sucio en el informe de condici n que hacemos indicamos su pureza
2618376 la versi n que se subastar tiene por medidas 37 x 66 pulgadas y esa es una de las cosas que m s ha llamado la atenci n a los que la han visto no es una copia de la versi n peque a nuestra teor a y osiris delgado est de acuerdo con ella es que esa versi n peque a le antecede esta es la versi n m s panor mica de la batalla y el pintor le da rienda suelta a su imaginaci n no s lo en la representaci n de la batalla sino adem s en el paisaje que sirve de trasfondo a ese momento
2618377 el cuadro lo hace en un momento importante de su ltima estad a en europa a principio de 1870 cuando lo hab an nombrado pintor oficial de la corte espa ola el tema de esa batalla le va bien a su nombramiento y al hecho de que se ocupe de representar temas hist ricos
2618378 y en el trato oller le dio igual importancia a ambos aspectos
2618379 creo que hay mucho de relatos que le hicieron y mucho de su imaginaci n no podemos olvidar que el coronel conteras y oller eran amigos y contempor neos
2618380 pensamos en oller como paisajista pero para entender esta obra hay que ver esos aspectos en su vida personal que le sirvieron de motivaci n para acercarse a ese tema

2618396 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2618397 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2618398 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2618399 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2618400 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2618401 there has been no direction on how to deal with this problem
2618402 people meet in private but nothing gets further than that if the election happens i think the trustees coming in with a mandate would be in a position to give leadership
2618403 they have turned our great religion into a small club of just 69 000 people
2618404 there is a motive for our action and that is to save our religion in india i want my religion to survive in india we believe that zoroastrianism should survive even if parsis dont
2618405 we are more orthodox than those who oppose us we follow all the rituals in their totality we are trying to bring it back to what it was before they made it into a racist religion to us the religion is more important than the question of race but to our opponents its the other way around it has become ingrained with parsi psychology
2618406 i think what we are seeing is redistribution of parsis around the world
2618407 parsis are emigrating to the us the uk australia and the middle east if you look at the numbers the 1982 census said there were 71 630 parsis and the latest census showed 69 601 so you have 2 000 fewer parsis in india but i think that more than 2 000 have emigrated in those 20 years
2618408 it is the ethnicity that has kept this religion alive for more than 3 500 years
2618409 what we need is early marriage and encouraging people to have families

2618415 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2618419 one of our finest moments occurred eighteen years ago when president george h
2618420 last summer i joined with my friend majority leader steny hoyer to introduce the ada restoration act adara
2618421 clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination on the basis of disability
2618422 the adara was originally drafted as a response to a number of supreme court cases that chipped away at the broad protections of the ada
2618423 the courts have created a situation in which disabled americans can now be discriminated against by their employers because of their impairments but these citizens are not considered disabled enough by our federal courts to invoke the protections of the ada
2618424 the substitute amendment that i am joining chairman conyers in offering reflects a hard sought compromise between members of the disability community and members from the business community
2618425 as in the original ada that passed congress in 1990 the substitute keeps the requirement that an impairment must
2618426 the substitute also contains a non exhaustive list of examples of major life activities it further notes that major life activities also include major bodily functions and contains a non exhaustive list of examples of major bodily functions
2618427 the substitute amendment contains language making it clear that the
2618428 the ada has been one of the most effective civil rights laws passed by congress
2618429 the substitute amendment before us today is the result of hard work and countless hours of good faith negotiations between staff disability advocates and business groups i look forward to passage by this committee today and expect broad bipartisan support when this bill reaches the house floor

2618436 i dont think its in anyones interest whether it be telstra or anybody else to be continuously associated with workchoices
2618437 its a wonderful opportunity to stand side by side with locals in goolwa and other south australians and say enough is enough we actually need urgent action

2618442 the attacks are occurring in georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia and mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2618443 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2618444 whatever site is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this site is not safe and they should know this
2618445 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2618446 mr saakashvili must do two things he must withdraw all forces from south ossetia and sign a legally binding document to never use force against south ossetia again
2618447 have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out
2618448 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2618449 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2618450 if there must be trouble let it be in my day that my child may have peace

2618489 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2618490 our unomig military observers report ongoing military preparation by the abkhaz de facto authorities for a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2618491 for about the last 20 years the conventional view for policy makers in washington is that any activity in the arctic and antarctic is basically related to science
2618492 i expect that sometime in the near future there will be an issuance of what they call a national security presidential directive to lay out new policy in the arctic
2618493 this will deal with more issues of sovereignty security presence and things like that
2618494 the question is what do we want to project up here
2618495 the primary mission right now is the maritime boundary line with russia keeping foreigners from stealing alaskan fish
2618496 the way we do that is either put ships or airplanes or both on the boundary line and we do a barking dog routine
2618497 the fleets are further north than ever because the species are moving north
2618498 ill lecture him on it when hes getting too much up in here
2618499 hell see a look on my face and say yes i know rielle
2618500 rielle wanted me to know all these things because she wanted me to write about them
2618501 if you let me see the films we can talk about that
2618502 she does not give off good energy she didnt make eye contact with me
2618503 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2618504 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2618505 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2618506 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2618507 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2618508 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2618509 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2618510 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2618511 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2618512 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2618513 well do what it takes during these tough times to keep the doors open
2618514 were all in this economy together we would like to be able to continue to offer our beautiful surroundings despite the high cost of gas
2618515 i knew we had a good car but it was going to be tough

2618518 i came up just a little bit short on fuel
2618519 i was hoping a yellow would come out that we could stay in front
2618520 it seems like every time i finish second scott dixon finishes first
2618521 penske had the right strategy but came up half a lap shy

2618561 bachmans is in the business of helping families express their sentiments in times of joy and in times of sorrow
2618562 we are simply overwhelmed with the gratitude and the outpouring of sympathy and well wishes from all over the world the calls and e mails were receiving are from peoples hearts and they speak so well of this extraordinary man
2618563 certainly a steady hand and a calm hand at the wheel at all time
2618564 i can only offer the deepest shock and sorrow we all feel here because the bachman family was always so close to our program
2618565 they still came back to support her former high school teams
2618566 it was just a great great couple supporting the programs and supporting the school
2618567 he never wanted to be above anybody their comments were always positive it never appeared to me in all these years ive known him that he was above anybody else i never got that kind of impression they were great human beings
2618568 he was just so incredibly supportive as a father of an athlete some people can get a little worked up at sporting events but he was just there in the stands waving his flag whether it was for team usa for ucla or for lakeville
2618569 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe

2618575 if you could wave a magic wand and the lawsuit was dropped we would go to work on getting a race and try to change their mind
2618576 im not bitter im just dissatisfied and unhappy and i feel bad that the team that we had the race track that we had they have both completely been put into a second class kind of atmosphere
2618577 with the opportunities weve been given we did as good a job as we can
2618578 we started 20th moved up to 12th and were running really well i could have easily driven up another few spots

2618613 the committee to protect journalists is deeply concerned that dhondup gonsar an american citizen of tibetan ethnicity who works for the u s government funded broadcaster radio free asia rfa has not yet received press accreditation from olympic organizers that would allow him to enter china to cover the olympic games which begin friday gonsar and radio free asia officials in washington have told cpj that rfa was informed in writing by the international olympic committee ioc in july 2007 that rfa had been allocated two sets of press credentials by the ioc but only received one for rfas mandarin service reporter

2618619 i still want to have this job in 20 years thatll only happen if there are still fish
2618620 to make sure that we werent put out of business as a one ship operation
2618621 and if things dont go our way we can end up with only half as much fish the next year
2618622 unfortunately the iuu is in fact out of control in some areas

2618625 it usually isnt clear who exactly is behind these operations in many cases they are backed by bogus companies
2618626 its such a wonderful profession and i dont regret it for a minute
2618627 but i cant say whether anyone will be doing it after us
2618628 there are no radicalized peasants among my main collaborators and those who have been encouraging or carrying out farm invasions in the last few days are not justified

2618633 hello i hope you are having a wonderful life and im keen to share that joy with you have a nice day
2618634 we hope they find an agreement either before the referendum or immediately afterwards on just one interpretation of the rules
2618635 security as to how their votes will be counted and how the results will be defined
2618636 im not afraid of the people its better to submit to the people than to certain domestic and foreign interests
2618637 most people think it the referendum is a distraction from the problems we have and i dont think itll change anything really
2618638 the governors who are recalled with less than 50 percent of the vote will make it known theyre not happy very very quickly and i think if morales is not ratified by a big margin we could see a deepening of the political crisis

2618646 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2618647 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2618648 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2618649 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2618650 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2618651 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2618652 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2618653 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan
2618654 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2618655 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that
2618656 they will be times that we hope they can be out by they will be based on conditions on the ground not according to hard deadlines
2618657 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
2618658 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
2618659 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native
2618660 in my mind were not really pushing any environmental laws or rules its just a natural thing very natural to the farm were not shooting guns or anything of the other things that the birds require
2618661 you might move them from one blueberry patch to another you might even move them out of the area
2618662 but falcons are a scare tactic and we always want to use an integrated approach we want to have a whole tool bag full of methods any and all methods that are effective and safe and i view falconry as one method that could have some use
2618663 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2618664 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2618665 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2618666 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2618667 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2618668 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2618669 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2618670 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2618671 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2618672 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2618673 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2618674 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2618675 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2618676 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2618677 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2618678 this has a greater significance than anything ive ever been part of
2618679 it will be the highest energy game ive ever been part of
2618680 if they dont understand this they dont know what theyre talking about its simple youre playing for your country

2618685 the market has opened up now well see how the league responds to it
2618686 we dont want people to have the wrong impression that we are selfish and cant play team basketball
2618687 we have to change the way people look at us
2618688 for the next president simply reversing this administrations policies is not the answer
2618689 compared with the flutters and flurries of the near daily polls in the presidential race one set of numbers has stayed fixed for months even years president george w bush now enters his 23rd consecutive month with an approval rating under 40 percent it currently stands at 32 percent no matter what he does or what happens in the world the public seems to have decided that bush has been a failure as a result both candidates are promising a change from the bush presidency barack obama of course promises a wholly different approach to the world but even bushs fellow republican john mccain has on several issues suggested that he would depart from the administrations policies mccain was last seen with the president at a fund raiser more than two months ago at which no reporters or photographers were allowed
2618690 to carry out wide scale attacks on physical and human targets
2618691 when i first asked for help at the va i got kind of a bad attitude from one person so i ended up leaving and not registering
2618692 a year later the stress was getting to me i started secluding myself from my family not wanting to do anything
2618693 my mom and my aunt eventually got me to talk with my county vso he got me registered with the va and since then i havent had a problem ive gotten a lot of help and every question ive gotten answered
2618694 it should be a national scandal that here our men and women in uniform who are protecting our freedom who are exposing themselves to harm are being denied the most basic civil right and that is the right to vote
2618695 y ou could not take a picture without bringing a camera along even if you owned any high class cameras system

2619013 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2619014 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2619015 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2619016 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2619017 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2619018 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2619019 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2619020 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2619028 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2619029 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2619030 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see

2619042 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2619043 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2619044 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2619045 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2619046 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2619047 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2619048 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from
2619049 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2619050 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2619051 how do you ensure that we have no income tax unless you limit the spending that is backing us into one

2619054 its important for us to get some momentum to get out there and play some live football you dont want to be going through the pre season and feel like you have work that needs to be done in games 3 and 4
2619055 i dont consider any of them major were just running into our fatigue injuries which most teams run into at this point
2619056 like i need all those choices in the toolbar like words arent hard enough on their own now i can choose colors and shape to try and make them mean what i want the result being i will probably be misinterpreted even more outrageously
2619057 i dont understand how someone can listen to this song and not be moved that key only works when i close the circuit with my finger i wish and i wish

2619066 they certainly have had some financing issues in recent months but i dont think there is any evidence non bank lenders are going to disappear completely and they will continue to provide some competition
2619067 any future cuts are a matter for the rba we certainly would expect a reduction to be passed on

2619101 here you can have my bottle i can easily get another one
2619102 i think its because so many of us spend so many hours of so many days online doing things that make us feel ashamed of ourselves
2619103 it means that gay men who were once socialized in brick and mortar establishments surrounded by other people are now being socialized online
2619104 when guys go to bars theyre going to be with their friends not to meet new people
2619105 larger than the membership of every major gay political organization combined

2619116 when we were teenagers when straight people were learning how to connect we didnt learn that
2619117 we learned that we had to survive on our own that means inside ourselves many of us dont have an innate belief that other people can meet our needs which means that we dont believe we can connect with them which means i have to rely on myself i have to live on my own and there i am in my bedroom all by myself and the computer is in the far corner and all i have to do is turn it on
2619118 the nightmare that gay people always have just underneath the surface the fear that im just my dick im just my body im just my age it reduces everybody to statistics youre presuming that nobody will love you for yourself if youre offering yourself as just a bunch of statistics

2619146 companies choose coldfusion to create complex and robust mission critical applications for internal and external access while there are a number of ways to integrate web content with relational data it is a simple task with coldfusion and the support for modern technology ajax net and java is a valid reason to consider using this product
2619147 so many positives the application administration interface is simple and intuitive
2619148 i believe the ability to dynamically generate pdfs is indispensible anyone that ever had to handle source and version control for documents at any company will be pleased that they can keep just one version of each document and let coldfusion create pdfs as needed very nice
2619149 this is a good product for companies already using older versions of coldfusion or companies looking to move older legacy systems to a newer more robust solution that easily integrates the application and relational database data the interface is intuitive just like adobes other products and i did not encounter any errors during my tests i have used other adobe products to create and support web applications but like that coldfusion lets me build applications not just linked html pages for use on the internet

2619204 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2619205 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2619206 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2619207 probably respresents compression rather than invasion although the latter cannot be totally excluded

2619220 indeed i must confess that as to the people of lilliput brobdingrag for so the word should have been spelt and not erroneously brobdingnag and laputa i have never yet heard of any yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being or the facts i have related concerning them because the truth immediately strikes every reader with conviction and is there less probability in my account of the houyhnhnms or yahoos when it is manifest as to the latter there are so many thousands even in this country who only differ from their brother brutes in houyhnhnmland because they use a sort of jabber and do not go naked i wrote for their amendment and not their approbation the united praise of the whole race would be of less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate houyhnhnms i keep in my stable because from these degenerate as they are i still improve in some virtues without any mixture of vice do these miserable animals presume to think that i am so degenerated as to defend my veracity yahoo as i am it is well known through all houyhnhnmland that by the instructions and example of my illustrious master i was able in the compass of two years although i confess with the utmost difficulty to remove that infernal habit of lying shuffling deceiving and equivocating so deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species especially the europeans

2619316 literature by women about families always has these larger considerations
2619317 with years of studying texts it becomes almost second nature to look beneath the surface at social and economic forces gender relationships and how they are played out in an arena that in my writing happens to be the home but then all sorts of things happening outside do affect what is happening inside the home
2619318 in my work i aim to show rather than tell
2619319 when there was this idea that india was just not a place to be in you had to get out nobody could get anywhere here its something i grew up with too kapur herself studied in halifax for a few years in the early 1970s but unlike many migrating indians of the time she did return and we all have family and friends who have had those nri experiences of course once i had the period and setting ready i had to have some kind of crisis
2619320 in this case i didnt want nina to get pregnant and then i had to have a reason for that baby is out why is baby out infertility wasnt enough of a reason and i didnt want anything as extreme as impotence there was more dramatic potential in a lingering dissatisfaction which led me to anandas sexual problem
2619321 that one word meanders inspired me to cut 30 000 words from the manuscript
2619322 rushdie i tried to write like that but in my hands it seemed inauthentic and laboured and so i gave it up intuitively i took the raasta of not standing between the reader and the story i wanted to make it as transparent and seamless as possible
2619323 and lots of other stuff i thought was very innovative but it all had to go eventually
2619324 its hard for me to see writing as a social stepping stone
2619325 its such a solitary activity whereas being in society means being gregarious of course younger people have more energy and if they can party and write good for them but if it interferes with your writing i would say just dont do it as a writer you have to serve your art old fashioned as it may sound and personally i do this by not meeting anyone
2619326 but it might be interesting to see what its all about my maids daughter works at a call centre i know a lot of young people who do and i am all for anything that promotes reading among people who arent habitual readers its a wonderful habit it encourages introspection and thinking
2619327 not just to keep up with contemporary fiction but also to expose yourself to what words can do to remind yourself that theres always a new goal to reach
2619328 having had a few books published im more confident with my writing now
2619329 and it had become difficult to write and work at the same time
2619330 during holidays i would do the huge revisions shaping tightening trying to bring together everything in my head during term time when my head was full of teaching i would work on first drafts you need to put down those words in the first place that would be easier to do to come home and just write 500 or 1 000 words that could subsequently be modified but the fashioning or making the thing into an artistic coherent whole
2619331 my daughter studies at the india habitat centre library and has to take along a shawl

2619359 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2619360 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2619361 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2619362 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2619363 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2619364 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2619365 could you finally build a successful online business if those with large lists busy websites and products that actually sell told you exactly how they do it
2619366 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2619367 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2619368 i have signed a decree imposing martial law and shall send it to parliament for confirmation since georgia has been attacked by russia sic

2619370 the aggressors sic wish to sow panic in georgia but they shall not get it since all of society is mobilised against the aggressors sic and the georgian government is acting with a clear intent
2619371 we are in contact with all our friends and there have been two sessions of the un security council devoted to georgia where the us and its allies blocked an equitable russian motion for an immediate ceasefire editors note yesterday i talked with chancellor angela merkel of germany president nicolas sarkozy of france is involved in the negotiations and in a short time i am talking with president bush of the us on the telephone yesterday i spoke several times to us secretary of state condoleezza rice i have had contact with all these presidents and prime ministers i am calling not only on behalf of georgia but to protest this well planned cheap provocation sic everyone knows that we did not invade tskhinvali and today abkhazia is accusing us of preparing to invade there as well

2619390 oh you might very well oh mr stearn wants to know all the details to see if there was any mischief involved

2619394 i will ask you one more time joanna what can you tell us about this incident if you have something to say spit it out girl
2619395 i did see someone near the cabin sir but i couldnt tell who it was
2619396 outrage shame i gave you a chance to be honest joanna and see it was of no use we know it was you this was merely to give you a chance to own up your lying has doubled your punishment
2619397 me sir but but it was meant to be a joke i had no idea what would happen
2619398 fortunately for you no one was seriously hurt or else this would be a matter for the police no instead this will be dealt with in house right here right now
2619399 joanna marvel for the heinous crime of burning down camp crystal lake for terrifying and singeing miss anderson for not owning up to your mischief and for ruining our drama camp you shall be punished with two hundred stripes with the strap
2619400 quiet two hundred stripes one hundred delivered by me and one hundred delivered by miss anderson furthermore you shall receive six stripes with the cane to drive the point home any questions
2619401 i know you wont joanna but there are still three to go ready
2619402 it is done the punishment given and taken joanna you are forgiven your crimes go in peace but mind you do not fall back into these wicked ways or you will get more of the same
2619403 will be using these in the next year or so
2619404 that wasnt bad but it was only a heat so hopefully i can get another good one in the final
2619405 i wasnt nervous that is how i am normally for the heats but i am sure i will be a little jittery in the morning
2619406 it was one of my best prelim swims things were playing on my mind a little bit you cant come here and not feel the pressure
2619407 there were a few nerves again today but they werent too bad
2619408 it was one of my best prelim swims things were playing on my mind a little bit you cant come here and not feel the pressure
2619409 there were a few nerves again today but they werent too bad
2619410 i was very nervous and excited all at the same time it was good just to get rid of all those butterflies and get out there
2619411 i am looking forward to the challenge in the final
2619412 nobody expects too much of you out there but i am going to bring some fire from the outside
2619413 it was good i was hoping to go close to my best time but the fact i am into the final is absolutely wonderful
2619414 what happens if some it comes into our real life
2619415 great i remember the turtles from when i was a young buck thisll be easy
2619416 you finish a movie and youre home for a couple of days and you start thinking what am i going to do with the rest of my life i mean im not a person who wants to go to the bahamas and lay out in the sun so maybe there are a couple of things i want to catch up on maybe i go to a show or a ball game or do something with my kids i hadnt had time to do but after a couple of days go by you think maybe itd be fun to make a murder mystery or a musical and before you know it youre doing it
2619417 i wouldnt say yes to every city that would call because youre committing yourself to writing a script that works in the city and living there for three months or something
2619418 but wed been to barcelona several times and my wife loves it and its a great place for the kids its right on the water
2619419 when i finish a film and im in the room at home and ive got to think of another film
2619420 then i got a call from penelope cruz who i didnt know from a hole in the wall she said i understand youre making a film in barcelona and i would like to participate so great that was a good start i wanted to have some spanish people in it otherwise just to put an american film in barcelona is nothing
2619421 they want to find me in it they want to find whats autobiographical in my movies they always fall into the fallacy of that movie was funny were you in a good mood in your private life then or that movie was sad were you in a dark place personally but going back when i made take the money and run and bananas this was not a happy time of my life at all whereas when i made cassandras dream and match point it was one of the best times of my life i was completely happy but people need with many filmmakers but certainly with me to a great deal to find a correlation with my mood in the film and the characters
2619422 we did have many many indications of interest but the committee has set the bar extremely high so the number of candidates interviewed would certainly be a very very small number
2619423 clearly the public service needs to take a look at why the salary is pegged so low but i do think it is a sufficiently prestigious position that there are good candidates who are canadian inside and outside the country
2619424 everybody sat there frozen afraid to say anything there hasnt been such a thing as dialogue for many years at least not when you have the senior players in the same room
2619425 deeply regrets the recent events and is pleased that he and mr th berge whom he regards as his supporter are now moving forward
2619426 everybody knows were older than we were then but its just not important to have to go around wearing a little pin that has your age on it
2619427 when we first started if you were like over 25 that was it you know
2619428 you could accept jazz musicians in their 60s and 70s but you couldnt think of the beatles you know paul mccartney still doing it in his 60s or the stones the whole things completely changed
2619429 when you see some of the bands in there its a bit pathetic
2619430 everybody thought we were doing black magic and that crap onstage
2619431 i was saying the satanists were the politicians a lot of people misinterpreted that
2619432 everyone was sick of people coming on with flowers in their hair and peace man and all this crap
2619433 we were a different generation we rebelled against that because we knew it wasnt going to be peace man and all that
2619434 i think you have to use imagery thats going to sell your product
2619435 i dont think we ever set out to be dangerous we were just like musicians expressing what we were seeing around us
2619436 i mean raps completely different thats like theyre going around shooting people and raping women and dissing hos thats not what were about at all
2619437 were not here to espouse heroin use or crack use or anything like that because weve grown up and done all those other things and realized its very counterproductive for your lifespan of course and for your brain
2619438 but you know you gotta smoke a little pot thats part of life
2619439 it was different stuff then it was a different time
2619440 once we get one show under our belt ill feel better
2619441 touring is just very difficult especially when youd like to be home
2619442 weve done this all of our lives and after a while it just becomes very difficult to travel the physicality of it is very difficult at times but its such a joy to be able to play the music that it just washes away all that that hour and a half to two hours a night just makes it all worthwhile
2619443 theres still rock and roll but the sex and drugs
2619444 whats it like being a young boy stuck in an old mans body
2619445 but musically im still doing the things i was doing particularly from the early traffic days i came out of the spencer davis group and made a conscious effort to try and combine different elements of music to make a music that was peculiar to me
2619446 i still think im doing the same thing ive been doing for 40 years
2619447 making a record now is more a means to give people a taste of what theyll get if they come see me live
2619448 where before playing live was more to give people a taste of what theyd get if they bought your record its probably turned right around
2619449 yeah weve built up a bit of a repertoire now
2619450 a good few hours of stuff its good though we can make a very strong hour set
2619451 in england and europe im known as much for playing guitar as organ because on the early hits i had over there which werent hits here i was playing guitar
2619452 being a jack of all trades might work against me i suppose i get forgotten sometimes
2619453 i suppose i shouldnt undersell myself ive been very lucky
2619454 i do try i think in rock n roll at the moment lately it can be very dark i try and lift peoples spirits rather than dampen them
2619455 i did not threaten to sue i just asked corrente to obey the law
2619456 attempts to turn neighbor against neighbor in an overhaul of his intelligence services
2619457 if you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen
2619458 obama has an incredibly compelling story to tell women in terms of his background his own economic struggle his single mom going to school relating to their concerns
2619459 a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away
2619460 heres where the rest of the rope would go if we had any more rope
2619461 aieeeeeee it hates nasty george bushes hates them hates them aieeeee
2619462 but those days do appear to be gone as best i can make it out
2619463 i believe that whatever doesnt kill you only makes you
2619464 but in the way of audience relation so what are we to feel and whose vocabulary are we to use in talking about it or are the two the same really or is there any difference anyway hey dont underestimate
2619465 the allegations are false and we believe the jury will conclude they are false
2619466 what another sex scandal great thats just what we need
2619467 tell me it was at least heterosexual were getting hammered on that lately no pun intended
2619468 this negotiation is an on going process it has not come to a halt tonight and will be resumed tomorrow in the course of the morning
2619469 right now as we speak russian bombers are bombing the poti port which is the western port of georgia as well as senaki airfield which was bombed numerous times today and of course it was quite anticipated from my side that we should have some kind of provocation in abkhazia as well we are seeing the bombing of kodori region of upper abkhazi
2619470 how else can we call it when hospitals are being destroyed schools residential areas when scores of thousands of refugees are leaving the republic
2619471 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2619472 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2619473 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2619474 russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible
2619475 we appeal to our friends and allies to call on russia to cease hostilities immediately
2619476 georgia is a peace loving nation but today we are being attacked north to south east to west
2619477 russian troops russian tanks that moved into south ossetia on their way expelled the whole ethnically georgian population of south ossetia
2619478 theyve committed as of this morning ethnic cleansing in all areas they control in south ossetia
2619479 russian forces have been specifically targeting civilian quarters they specifically attacked and blew up the whole civilian quarter in the town of gori far away from the place where the conflict area is and where direct friction between forces is they attacked civilian installations in the western part of georgia theyve attacked residential quarters all around the country theyve attacked civilian hospitals and most of the casualties are among civilians
2619480 close to the artillery base located near the entrance to the city we saw a dreadful sight
2619481 aside from the base itself two apartment blocks were on fire the yard was full of bodies
2619482 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2619483 they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered
2619484 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6
2619485 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2619486 from a legal point of view russias actions in south ossetia are totally legitimate
2619487 i think there are various mechanisms that the united states can use when dealing with russia both in a bilateral format individually as well as collectively together with its european colleagues
2619488 this is precisely what we are hoping for that the russian federation will be pressured to stop the bombardments the aggression against georgia i would not be able to speak about any concrete talks and consultations that are under way but i can confirm that the united states has assumed this function of a mediator
2619489 our task is to help overcome the consequences of the humanitarian catastrophe
2619490 carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to peace
2619491 russian propaganda channels are saying that 1 500 people have died in south ossetia this is total nonsense this is being done deliberately to prove that georgias armed forces killed many which is a total lie in fact apart from the militants our forces have killed no one during the attack against us in tskhinvali the fire opened in response brought virtually no casualties among civilians i say this with full responsibility
2619492 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace they are also responsible for protecting the population
2619493 over the past one and a half days more than 30 000 people have crossed the border
2619494 al principio no ten amos idea de lo que era pod a haber estado en nuestro sistema solar o en los l mites del universo
2619495 el propio cu sar ya no es visible pero su luz contin a viajando por el espacio y el hannys voorwerp no es sino un eco masivo de su luz extinta
2619496 for us to refrain from any further sanctions in the un security council for them to refrain from any other nuclear activity that is what we are asking which we call freeze for freeze
2619497 its something very sensible to engage in the process of negotiation its as simple as that
2619498 we are not fighting peaceful towns and are not conducting military strikes against civilians we are only seeking to ensure peace
2619499 acting within our peacekeeping mission and in line with the mandate issued by the international community russia is engaged in the task of forcing the georgian side to accept peace while defending the lives and property of its citizens as is required under the constitution and laws of the russian federation and the legal standards of any civilized country
2619500 i do not rule out that the hague and strasbourg courts and institutions in other cities will be involved in investigating these crimes and this inhuman drama that has been played out
2619501 were killed by their own georgian partners in the peacekeeping forces
2619502 there is a russian battalion an ossetian battalion and a georgian battalion and all of a sudden the georgians georgian peacekeepers begin shooting their russian colleagues this is of course a war crime
2619503 we are not fighting peaceful towns and are not conducting military strikes against civilians we are only seeking to ensure peace
2619504 im deeply concerned about the situation in georgia the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2619505 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6
2619506 we are not fighting peaceful towns and are not conducting military strikes against civilians we are only seeking to ensure peace
2619507 mi aiuti devo trovare un lavoro per guadagnare i soldi per curare la mia mamma che tanto malata
2619508 people who i usually like do be doin rude things like cutting people out of chat circles not being nice to each and every person nd stuff they do be actin like theyre dead cool and being quite ignorant and unempathetic with the shy people and the people that dont really know anyone
2619509 simon blint director of visitor relations at the sfmoma is a first rate asshole
2619510 it brought tears to my eyes because bernie mac has always been my all time favorite entertainer and comedian it pains me to have to report that
2619511 he even had dancers called macaronis that was my first exposure to how talented bernie mac was and after that show thats when hollywood started beating down his door
2619512 there is not currently much danger of a counter coup that is largely because mauritanians are used to military coups but also there is no figurehead from which the opposition can really rally around and that is the reason why the military have still kept president abdallahi in custody and why the prime minister is still in custody as well to neutralize the effect of a possible counter coup
2619513 i think that the international community at the time of the elections were very much encouraging of the transition even with the european union calling it a model transition
2619514 mauritania was re engaging with international donors it was also welcome back into the african union fold of course it is difficult for the country to have all the institutions in place to ensure that the transition was going to last but the rapidity with which things have deteriorated in the country cannot be overstated
2619515 i think the georgian leadership has not done the right thing here by not alerting anyone ahead of time by not highlighting any rise in tensions i think in any case that there is no alternative to a peaceful resolution of this issue
2619516 armenia is in the region where the conflict is at this moment and there is no doubt it worries us we really hope that a solution will be found very quickly because at this moment it is true that no solution has been found in the area of security but i think the problem must unequivocally be resolved by peaceful means
2619517 azerbaijan supports georgias territorial integrity and the south ossetia conflict should be solved only within this framework at the same time georgia has every right to restore its territorial integrity provided by the norms and principles of international law including the un charter and therefore all the steps taken by georgia in this direction are in accordance with international law
2619518 these provocations are aimed to destroy georgias strategic plans to become a full fledged member of the north atlantic alliance in a few years
2619519 it is a situation where ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgeries are taking place in corridors people are hiding out in their basements
2619520 there is no electricity no communications no access to basic supplies so it is a worrying situation and we also in addition call on all sides to respect international humanitarian law and to not target civilians to ensure that medical transport and medical facilities can treat wounded as necessary
2619521 this morning a unhcr staff member there reported that many buildings and houses have been destroyed and that only military personnel are moving on the streets water is also in short supply that is a chronic problem and it is being worsened by recent events most transport has stopped and shops are running out of food
2619522 the sides of the conflict have been playing a kind of cat and mouse game for a couple of years now and theyve always kind of pushed each other to the brink but then pulled back
2619523 unfortunately thats not what happened in the past 24 hours and what weve seen is a large scale military offensive throughout south ossetia
2619524 a unhcr staff member in that area has reported that many buildings and houses have been destroyed and that only military personnel are moving in the streets
2619525 water is in short supply most transport has stopped and shops are running out of food
2619526 russia has about 100 000 troops in the region just because its so heavily militarized from chechnya and the other insurgencies that are going on next door
2619527 if this is a long war georgia will be in a considerable amount of trouble just because its forces are so much smaller it only has about 27 000 soldiers and it would rely also on these militia groups that it is starting to reactivate as well but in a long war georgia would be in trouble
2619528 are now carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to peace
2619529 what russia has been doing against georgia for the last two days represents an open aggression unprecedented in modern times
2619530 it is a direct challenge for the whole world if russia is not stopped today by the whole world tomorrow russian tanks might reach any european capital i think everyone has understood this by now
2619531 we see panic rising among the population and the number of refugees trying to save their own lives and the lives of their children and families growing
2619532 the united states calls for an immediate cease fire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2619533 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2619534 i understand that the russian federation is a permanent member it is very hard to counter or oppose a permanent member in the security council but what i offer you is to have very solid statement to get to the government of the russian federation and as well the opposing parties that this kind of action should stop
2619535 the bombardment of the sovereign territory of georgia should stop and we call for an immediate cease fire
2619536 pull back from the brink of a full fledged war
2619537 not allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2619538 let nothing you affright this day is born a saviour of a pure virgin bright to free all those who trust in him from satans powr and might
2619539 how come i cant find my way back to reality while for most of the arab youth they either live without dreams or dream without living
2619540 no more talk about youth and what they can or cannot it is time for us to starting doing instead of just being a subject for discussion
2619541 if nabil al khameri doesnt surrender himself to justice we will kill his nephew and kidnap many other people from his family until he responds
2619542 but when they got out of sanaa the companions and the car were released while the son was taken to bani dhabian tribe
2619543 al barakani has to respect the power he has and not change the issue into revenge killing because if it changes into revenge killing he will be the first victim
2619544 in addition to the various activities are many simple and traditional games that children will love and which also can help develop their mental skills
2619545 i want to help show yemenis the culture that i love
2619546 practicing humanitarian and lawful duties defending suspects before the court
2619547 a violation of their rights to defend the suspects and also an infringement on the syndicates duties
2619548 its also considered a prejudice to justice and a crime according to valid laws
2619549 we apologize to the detainees and their families because we cant continue
2619550 going to this court has become a risk for us the judge is a foe to the detainees so only with a real court and a normal judge can we defend the detainees
2619551 the judge refused to hand us the case file and when one of us tried to talk to the judge he said shut up otherwise i will force you out
2619552 otherwise the syndicate will inform all its members to stop dealing with the specialized criminal court
2619553 social affairs greatly affect population issues considering the fact that the family represents society in general because it is a cornerstone in building a healthy society thus any trouble affecting the family could reflect negatively on all segments of society
2619554 our ministry will work to integrate population issues into its plans in a scientific systematic and planned manner in order to create a starting point to develop scheduling and reorder priorities resume meetings with the various concerned parties and share views with the other development partners in an effort to arrive at a more explicit vision that may achieve the desired integration
2619555 integrated within the ministrys annual program will be activities involving three components gender issues population development and reproductive health
2619556 regarding the population component our operating programs are formulated and implemented in coordination with the national population council and have the technical support unit for that purpose
2619557 one component of unfpas country program is to build human capital and improve social protection networks performance in such a way as to assist us in achieving the millennium development goals via the programs main components as the ministry of social affairs and labor is a key partner in executing this program
2619558 defending islam against rallies and celebrations that pollute the minds of our sons and daughters through singing impudence and mixing of the two sexes
2619559 pay us 5 million if it wants these attacks be stopped in the country
2619560 the security apparatuses identified the attacker who was killed in the operation
2619561 but they avoid mentioning his name at present to secure the secrecy of the investigation
2619562 this is based on the idea that those who are pro america are against islam and consequently they are legitimate targets to attack
2619563 hadramout governorate is home to al qaeda cells and its ideology
2619564 regional and international hands stand behind these terrorist attacks that aim to hinder investment and development in hadhramout which is considered the bridge to the development of all the other governorates
2619565 a security sector should be established in the governorate to detect and collect data about security issues
2619566 additionally the process of establishing local police force should be hastened and supported
2619567 the decision to end the war is a courageous one reflecting the political leaderships concern to cease bloodshed and restore security and stability to the governorate
2619568 the state and its political leadership care much about fostering development and reconstructing those areas damaged by the war
2619569 i contacted the political security organization more than once to release my husband but i was told to go to president saleh
2619570 without people like mr hamdan bin laden would enjoy no support he would not enjoy protection and he probably would not have been able to elude capture up to this point
2619571 ska du inte b rja klaga p allting och s ga hur mycket du hatar att vara h r
2619572 this exceptional growth is fuelled by a marked increase in advisory service line participation in addition to healthy growth on the assurance side
2619573 that we can produce such results in a climate of a global downturn is a testament to our ability to be always one step ahead
2619574 this part of the world is fast becoming more important to our network and we have well developed plans to move people and invest in our business here
2619575 while our middle east firm is already growing at a fast pace in excess of 30 a year the nature of the things we do is pushing us to put ever deeper skills into our areas of specialty
2619576 our peoples continued focus on excellence and their demonstrated ability to work together across geographies to meet our clients needs is fundamental to our success our results show that our client centric business model built upon a global culture of consultation and collaboration and delivery through strong member firms with global connections is a winning strategy
2619577 its the right thing for all businesses to play their part in the overall corporate responsibility agenda at deloitte middle east we recognize corporate responsibility as a strategic priority and strive to significantly elevate our impact on a regional level
2619578 these are clearly uncertain economic times our focus on innovation together with our strong global culture and diversity of skills will enhance our ability to assist our clients as they compete in these turbulent times at deloitte we remain focused on our long term success and will continue to invest in our people new products and services and maintain our long standing commitment to corporate responsibility
2619579 more than mere words and visits are needed to free nour from his prison cell and open a space for free expression in egypt
2619580 congress and the bush administration must use all tools at their disposal including direct assistance to dissidents foreign aid and diplomacy if they are to have any real impact in the middle east
2619581 all the world knows that mr nour was imprisoned on trumped up charges because he had the temerity to present himself as a candidate for president of egypt in 2005
2619582 while his lengthy incarceration is an affront first of all to the people of egypt who desire to live in a democratic society it must also be seen as an indirect slap at the united states for urging mubarak to relax his grip on the political system
2619583 the president did not talk to the field leader of the diehard huthi fighters
2619584 the huthis have opened the blockades of most of the garrisons that were besieged before the truce
2619585 the huthis have actually taken over several positions and villages which were not in their domain before
2619586 we dont have anything to eat and the water is undrinkable
2619587 we drink from ponds and live in deserted old homes schools or mosques because we dont have tents all of the places we live in are crowded with other families who have suffered a similar fate
2619588 many homes were destroyed and looted after residents left their farmlands and businesses we now live in a miserable and unsettled situation
2619589 i still remember that day when i was with my family and being subjected to gunfire during the battle between the two sides
2619590 i couldnt believe we had survived until i was about a kilometer away from the battlefield
2619591 the disaster that has befallen those in these warring areas is unforgettable
2619592 several soldiers looted homes taking everything inside gold guns anything valuable
2619593 i went to harf sifyan with one officer when i arrived at my house i was surprised to see that it was open with around 20 soldiers inside i entered and saw that everything was destroyed
2619594 we demand that our houses be rebuilt our property returned and that we be compensated for what weve lost we need nothing more than this
2619595 as a consequence of this war i lost my ability to study this year because part of my school was dest access to potable water and health services are poor and infrequent royed and my family now is dispersed
2619596 even though i now may return to my home i wont find anywhere to live because my home is destroyed
2619597 these people urgently need food and others suffer the same problem but we cant reach them because armed groups looted three red crescent relief campaigns on may 25 in the ghamr area of amran governorates houth district
2619598 the saada community has witnessed massive deterioration since the beginning of 2008 due to this war on one hand and food price hikes on the other
2619599 were concerned about affected families and their situations and we ask the two sides to facilitate aid
2619600 many peoples homes and farms were destroyed so were now working to enable them to resume their normal lives
2619601 there was a script i read recently where i was like ooh this horrible thing happens and its really good because theyre all dead
2619602 no visions can encompass him but he encompasses all visions
2619603 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
2619604 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses

2619606 even when i was going up in gymnastics you tend to get a little nervous you think i gotta hit this set i gotta do this something that was resonating for me was there is no way this can go wrong the way this team is doing it was just boom one guy after another its just feeding off each other it was absolutely awesome
2619607 in training my sets have been going really well and that is why they put me up second to last i had a little bobble here and there and going into the dismount i got a little rushed
2619608 i was honestly the most proud of parallel bars it is very intricate event to me a lot like pommel horse for some people its easier to hold back theres a lot of hand placements for me to go out there and hit a longer routine with a higher start value is a great feeling it was awesome

2619610 the rule of law is the rule by the laws that govern a true democracy they are the laws that provide for a proper balance between the protection of human rights and the interests of the state laws which an independent and responsible judiciary can enforce to protect all members of society from abuse of power
2619611 it means rules and procedures that are transparent and rules of evidence that make sense and are fair these basic principles apply universally and without them the rule of law means little or nothing
2619612 for the first time in its history the united states sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment us held captives making torture the official law of the land in all but name
2619613 rules and procedures that are transparent and rules of evidence that make sense and are fair
2619614 while our government condones guantanamo bay the world is perplexed about our approach to the rule of law
2619615 you may ask how will it help in regard to the continuing outrage at guantanamo bay for our government now to condemn it the answer is that it would at last be a powerful signal to the world that britain supports the international rule of law

2619618 in briefing the age i said that there was no visible tension between international and local students but the two populations are largely separated and there is potential for backlash and resentment down the track if we dont draw local students into internationalisation
2619619 yet the headline describes ghettos and resentment as if these are established facts
2619620 in some editions of the paper the article more accurately reports me as saying that there is no problem just a potential problem
2619621 the benefits of studying in australia such as the quality of the education experience the challenge of living and learning in a foreign country and the personal growth and development in adapting to challenging circumstances far outweigh the perceived issues identified by recent media coverage
2619622 international education enriches students by enabling them to experience a new culture develop understanding of a new community and make lifelong friendships that transcend national borders

2619625 the basic elements of contemporary right wing thought can be reduced to three first there has been the now familiar sustained conspiracy running over more than a generation and reaching its climax in roosevelts new deal to undermine free capitalism to bring the economy under the direction of the federal government and to pave the way for socialism or communism a great many right wingers would agree with frank chodorov the author of the income tax the root of all evil that this campaign began with the passage of the income tax amendment to the constitution in 1913 the second contention is that top government officialdom has been so infiltrated by communists that american policy at least since the days leading up to pearl harbor has been dominated by men who were shrewdly and consistently selling out american national interests finally the country is infused with a network of communist agents just as in the old days it was infiltrated by jesuit agents so that the whole apparatus of education religion the press and the mass media is engaged in a common effort to paralyze the resistance of loyal americans
2619626 we capture every thought and make it give up and obey christ
2619627 peter took jesus aside and told him not to talk like that

2619631 we had run out here and the truck started catching on fire
2619632 we pulled one guy from the truck and busted the window out of the other one and greg pulled that guy out he was wedged in there pretty good
2619633 hes just doing some individual stuff were bringing him along slow we really dont know whats going to happen this week well see where hes at its good to see him out there though
2619634 i thought they were okay thats why we went in spiders pads and tomorrow well do special teams and then go through a shorter practice in the afternoon then well put the pads back on monday
2619635 i think it was more of a teaching mode today we put in some more things on offense and defense they reviewed the tape and looked at themselves there is a lot of improvement but weve got to do a lot of things better i think they know that especially after they watched the tape
2619636 well be a physical football team i believe that i believe the way we go about our business in practice showed up in the chicago game with that being said i told them well go pads once in practice the next three or four days then in the morning well meet and then well go hard in practice now practice in the afternoon may be a little bit longer but i think its the way youve got to handle it when you only have 80 guys
2619637 the physical part the physical part not the mental part weve still got a lot of improvement and we have a lot of young guys making mistakes mistakes you can correct toughness you have to find out about in practice they proved that and the key was how we played chicago that was the key
2619638 we needed to go hit em and be physical and i thought we played pretty physical
2619639 yeah hes a guy who can go both sides and were going to give him some reps with the first group and see how that works out there are a lot of positions still open on this football team a lot of competition going on we want to make sure we get the guys at the right positions that want to do it the way we want them to do it we told them very simply youve got to do it the way we want you to do it if you do it that way youve got a great chance to play for us
2619640 there are always some things you expect certain things out of certain players sometimes especially the veteran guys you expect to play a certain way most of them did okay but they were a little rusty too but i thought they did some decent things some guys i was a little more disappointed than others i never mention names
2619641 if youre defensive guy its practice and it works that way sometimes brodie was trying to throw the ball away and i should have blown the whistle
2619642 yeah the first series of 16 plays youre glad about going 91 yards and overcoming a bunch of third downs
2619643 those penalties were caused by us we had four plays and three penalties and went backwards you cant do that
2619644 absolutely and its just little things that come up and weve got to correct those things
2619645 i thought special teams covered fairly well i thought the kickers kicked the punt coverage teams were okay the protection wasnt as good as you would like i thought the punter punted very well
2619646 they only got one shot theyre not going to kick it in the endzone we know that i thought our coverage teams were pretty good what they did to us and we havent practiced that a whole bunch they kicked it in the corners a whole bunch and it was hard to get a decent return weve got to work on that but i think we have some return guys i really do i think we have some guys who can return the football especially on the kicks now weve got to see about bj sams and whoever else we have
2619647 its close and there are three games left hopefully we can get in better field goal position but ill take touchdowns though if we score three touchdowns and one field goal ill take 24 points every week if we can get it they just didnt have a lot of opportunities so you try to measure what you see in practice
2619648 i dont know thats a tough call i think you just have to go with what your gut tells you if its close then youve got to rely on them and see what happens

2619802 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2619803 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense

2619812 mass circumcision campaigns will result in hundreds of thousands of complications and could make the hiv crisis worse
2619813 there are already numerous reports of males lining up to get circumcised so they no longer will need to use condoms
2619814 male circumcision is a dangerous distraction in the hiv battle even if circumcision does offer some degree of reduced risk per sexual incident individuals engaged in high risk behavior are still at risk for hiv and circumcision does not protect women giving circumcised males and their partners the false impression that they are protected will make the situation worse by increasing risk taking behavior further mass circumcision campaigns will likely overwhelm the already overburdened african healthcare infrastructure and divert resources away from other needed and more effective hiv prevention strategies
2619815 alliance of organizations dedicated to protecting the normal anatomy of males females and the intersexed that was formed to coalesce the many activist organizations each with a specific focus into one common voice
2619816 male circumcision is too costly to justify in the hiv battle even if circumcision does offer some protection against heterosexually transmitted hiv condoms clearly provide more protection at a much lower cost
2619817 we found that it just doesnt make sense to perform mass surgeries in a region of the world struggling to meet the most basic healthcare needs especially when there are more cost effective plans for achieving the same results

2619819 four mexican army soldiers entered southern arizona and pointed their rifles at a u s border patrol agent early this week the border patrol said the incident sunday was the mexican militarys 43rd incursion across the u s border since october the agency said however it was unusual because firearms were involved
2619820 we are deeply concerned by the biases and one sided view being given to aids experts around the world
2619821 data showing circumcision is not cost effective and that circumcision may cause serious harm in the hiv battle have been ignored before the world health community spends millions if not billions of dollars on male circumcision programs aids policy makers need to carefully consider all data on the risks and potential benefits of the use of male circumcision not just selective data

2619823 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2619824 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2619825 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2619826 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2619827 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2619828 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market
2619829 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2619830 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2619831 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2619832 when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them

2619834 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home

2619836 that was probably the hardest bout ive ever fenced in my career
2619837 were just chipping away at a number of things weve got quite a few things to work on but i thought we executed pretty well
2619838 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2619839 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2619840 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2619841 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2619842 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2619843 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2619844 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2619845 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2619857 next you think about your r4 or r5 you definitely need to score for your maths science and mother tongue and that leaves you a space for one or two subject to score how many subject do you have 7 then i suggest forgo one subject im not telling you to fail miserably i knew i am scoring for my bio combined science a maths e maths and history and i am forgoing my literature because its not worth my time spending time for it when i know i have a higher chance to get as for the rest and true enough alhamdullillah i scored as for the other 5 subjects and still got a b4 for literature i didnt fail miserably after all
2619858 so you see guys you study smart not study hard i dont expect you to remember 100 on chemistry 70 is good enough and try to score full marks for your mcq and practical it gives you a fighting chance against the rest of the other good schools in singapore
2619859 you have to understand you are competing with your cohort in the whole of singapore and not whether the paper is easy or difficult if your cohort are hardworking you will lose out
2619860 whatever it is you need your science and now the competition for poly courses are getting fiercer and fiercer because students who can go jc are opting for poly my sister failed her science and wanted to go to design school where you dont need science at all but she didnt meet the criteria you see its all competition and you cant run away from it

2619890 en cuanto a la disponibilidad de terrenos se ha mencionado en autos que los operadores de telefon a m vil enfrentan crecientes dificultades para instalar nuevas antenas en zonas densamente pobladas atendida la escasez de terrenos o por los efectos urban sticos y ambientales que producen as se ha dicho en autos que lo anterior podr a incrementar de manera significativa las dificultades al ingreso de competidores a las zonas m s densamente pobladas y particularmente atractivas para el desarrollo de este negocio o impedir a que stos entreguen una cobertura competitiva con la de los incumbentes en el concurso al respecto este tribunal considera que si se hubiera demostrado que existen lugares en los que no sea posible instalar nuevas antenas de modo que las existentes constituyeran facilidades esenciales ser a razonable obligar a sus titulares a compartir su uso a cambio de un precio de mercado transparente y no discriminatorio si hubiere factibilidad t cnica para ello y fuere imposible para un potencial entrante realizar inversiones razonables para duplicar la infraestructura existente para dar cobertura en dichas zonas

2619894 el alto precio del petr leo est dando las se ales adecuadas y los incentivos necesarios para que los agentes econ micos destinen esfuerzos y recursos a su sustituci n por eso es un error intentar bajar su precio mediante subsidios pues stos recubren de opacidad las se ales de precio que el mercado requiere para operar apropiadamente tampoco es correcto eliminar los impuestos espec ficos que lo gravan pues stos se fundan en la necesidad de internalizar los costos de las externalidades de contaminaci n y congesti n que provoca su uso
2619895 una explicaci n posible para el componente intuitivo de los ltimos fallos es que ello obedecer a a que el sistema de protecci n de la competencia no posee los instrumentos legales que permitan verificar lo que intuyen
2619896 aprobar cambios a la ley de competencia que dieran mayores facultades de investigaci n a la fne e incluyeran la posibilidad de arrepentimiento eficaz eso podr a permitir que los fallos del tdlc estuvieran fundados en argumentos t cnicamente muy rigurosos a diferencia de la situaci n actual

2619898 que est haciendo el tc respecto de los derechos econ micos y sociales y las revisiones de precios ver
2619899 que como puede apreciarse de la sola lectura de la regla impugnada y referida en el considerando anterior en ella se consagra un derecho en favor de las isapres que consiste en la facultad de fijar o aumentar unilateralmente el valor de sus planes de salud al mismo tiempo que regula y restringe esa facultad la que s lo puede ejercerse dentro de los m rgenes que la propia ley determina en caso alguno podr a estimarse que esta f rmula legislativa por el solo hecho de permitir la alteraci n unilateral pero regulada de un precio resulte contraria a la carta fundamental esta no proh be en precepto alguno que la ley permita la modificaci n unilateral del precio de un contrato dentro de ciertos l mites y m rgenes establecidos por el propio legislador esta f rmula es por lo dem s habitual en los contratos dirigidos de tracto sucesivo que t picamente vinculan a privados que proveen un bien esencial de consumo masivo que satisface necesidades b sicas algunas de las cuales como la educaci n la salud el transporte y los servicios esenciales como la electricidad o el agua potable constituyen adem s consumos que satisfacen derechos constitucionales conforme a criterios de econom a social de mercado el estado ha dejado de producirlos por s mismo y permite conforme al principio de subsidiariedad que los provean los particulares por precio y ganancia aunque regulada ello no es contrario a la constituci n la que no obliga al estado a proveer esos bienes y servicios b sicos para obtener que los particulares produzcan y provean tales bienes esenciales lo habitual es que la ley permita alzar los precios unilateralmente al proveedor dentro de ciertos l mites que se establecen por la autoridad en base a c lculos acerca de las alteraciones en los costos de producci n del bien o servicio que el particular provee si la autoridad no permitiera al proveedor alzar unilateralmente los precios y exigiera para ello la concurrencia de la voluntad del usuario nadie se interesar a en proveer estos bienes o servicios de consumo masivo que resultan necesarios para satisfacer derechos constitucionales toda vez que los costos de producirlos y proveerlos s cambian la participaci n de los privados en proveer estos bienes que la carta fundamental no proh be se har a imposible el alza unilateral en el precio de los contratos s lo podr a estimarse como prohibida en un esquema constitucional que prohibiera la participaci n de los privados en la provisi n de bienes y servicios p blicos lo que ciertamente no hace nuestra carta fundamental en consecuencia la constituci n no proh be la alteraci n unilateral pero regulada en el precio de un bien esencial aunque tales bienes o servicios faciliten el goce de derechos constitucionales

2619932 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2619933 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2619934 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2619935 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2619936 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2619937 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2619938 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2619939 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2619940 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2619941 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds

2619951 we dont know the answer to that question thats why were here
2619952 as it dropped off the bridge rail the bus rolled to the right where it came to rest
2619953 certain irregularities about whether the bus was operating under the name angel tours or iguala busmex it is important to note that neither of these domestic entities is authorized to operate as a u s passenger carrier in interstate commerce at this time
2619954 as being a high risk carrier due to safety violations detected during roadside safety inspections and was subjected to an fmcsa compliance review in may 2008
2619955 this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours operations out of service
2619956 to date angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service
2619957 fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements
2619958 and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling not a safe feeling
2619959 i feel a little bit shaky but i just let myself at peace and then go to sleep
2619960 as i opened my eyes i see the chair falling off and i was sitting right below the tv and i felt that somebody was laying on my leg and then right next to me there was a lady she got her arm really crushed up and on top of her there was another lady she cannot move
2619961 as a matter of psychology i think most of us value investors think we have plenty enough bargains already and may not be able to handle that many more
2619962 until the values can be defined i think youre somewhat taking your life into your hands
2619963 a lot of value investors went into financials in the spring and theyre now getting killed
2619964 a small portion of our losses will not be recovered we underestimated the speed and severity of credit deterioration and overestimated some companies ability to cope with credit and liquidity problems
2619965 salim hamdan was working for a bad organization and he knew that
2619966 i think we all had to reconcile that before we got on the plane
2619967 the defense would say the accused made the mistake of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
2619968 the prosecutors would give the image of him being a hardened terrorist
2619969 it came down to the evidence that we were allowed to see
2619970 i thought it was unusual considering the crimes he was accused of i know there are people who hate people or entities
2619971 the reality is he didnt have to get up at all he could have just sat there
2619972 the penalty should be so significant that it forecloses any possibility that he renews his ties with terrorism
2619973 unless you can say we should have hanged him are you going to make that same statement of every individual
2619974 just as we adhere to the geneva convention and we try to set the standards with the sanctity of human rights
2619975 you have to trust the government to a certain degree
2619976 i would take their word for it because yes i do believe in the government

2619979 its a wonderful opportunity to stand side by side with locals in goolwa and other south australians and say enough is enough we actually need urgent action

2619981 to save the river we need water and we need it now
2619982 all the politicians have to do is show the will to buy the water and send it downstream
