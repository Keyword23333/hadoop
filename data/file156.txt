1560051 r ight now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1560052 an ion or charged particle that consists of an atom of chlorine surrounded by four oxygen atoms it is an oxidant that releases oxygen but it is not a powerful one
1560053 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1560054 if confirmed the result is exciting because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
1560055 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1560056 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1560057 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates
1560058 quarterback controversy in the making hardly should brennan have stayed in canton an extra day to be measured for a hall of fame bust certainly not but just to be sure coach jim zorn and his coaching staff have moved quickly to stomp out the brennan hype hell have to time to work on the flaws the most probable scenario for 2008 is that brennan spends the entire season holding the clipboard as the no 3 quarterback
1560059 hey i remember watching that guy back in the day
1560060 fact ive never heard of a band so limited get so much love the sex pistols dont stand the test of time and are more famous for the whole sid and nancy murder mystery than anything else other bands were far better and far more punk than this group of assholes with gimmicked names no redeeming qualities at all and i gotta believe that anyone who thinks the sex pistols are punk legends arent saying so because they actually believe it or are even punk fans but rather because its a name they know and think dropping it will make them look smart yeah fuck the sex pistols
1560061 okay i dont think you are thinking about the sex pistols in the correct way
1560062 theo oh wise one why might this concern me i care not for what these developer minions have to deal with

1560067 i can pretty much guarantee to you that if bioshock wasnt successful there never would have been another game like this
1560068 i dont even know how we convinced people to pay for bioshock these games had never made any money everybody told us when we were pitching bioshock sounds like a great idea youll sell 150 000 units next
1560069 how many of these type of games do you think are going to be made now compared to how many were going to be made before
1560070 how many people had played these kind of games before 300 000 400 000 maybe now millions of people because of this game have played this type of game
1560071 before as great as system shock 2 and deus ex were nobody bought them we wanted to crack that i think now the skys the limit for how deep these games can go
1560072 it is very important and will help our lads a lot people may think differently though we have players who like carrying the ball so its a great boost obviously it will suit kerry too as it is their second home now but im delighted and i think well relish the open spaces

1560086 a gente j vive num medo cotidiano t o desagrad vel que o cinema oferece maneiras de expurgar a situa o com mortes digamos criativas as pessoas se incomodam muito com o sucesso desses filmes n o me importo porque fica claro que tudo ali divers o se voc tem um parente atropelado na rua n o tem gra a alguma no cinema voc tem a experi ncia da morte sem risco como a da montanha russa por que algu m passeia nela para ter emo es intensas

1560088 all along i had a feeling in my gut that there was something wrong with that boy

1560090 we know we are close to bangladesh as a team we dont fear them and it will be great to test ourselves against them again and against india the world champions both games will be fantastic
1560091 having to share the trophy was a disappointing way to end this tournament but we achieved our main aim of qualification and we played some good cricket over the three days

1560094 in the rehearsal period gill brought in a real live psychic and ive never actually gone to a psychic before so i was pretty fascinated by the process this guy was really quite believable he was very low key i wanted to know what it felt like when youre channelling or doing whatever it takes to get to that state of mind so he kind of changed my whole perspective on it i would love to be able to contact people on the other side if i could speak to my grandmother tonight id be doing it so i do believe im not one of those people who say poo poo to it i truly believe in it
1560095 no but i wish i could have a psychic to remind me of my lines laughs no nothing peculiar happened one guy really cracked me up in rehearsals though and i was completely unprofessional he was a houdini fanatic and god bless him he was very knowledgeable but he was one of those kinds of trainspotting people who knew what kind of underwear houdini wore so i kind of lost if for a while when we were in this meeting and i had to excuse myself i couldnt look at the man
1560096 i think the fact that we both had celtic accents helped us referring to irish actress saoirse ronan its quite amazing how really different the accent is my problem was to stop being very lilty
1560097 oh definitely it was great to be back and i was lucky to have the family with me it was just on the summer break and just to be working there with a whole bunch of the crew i knew from many years ago was fantastic actually the dolly grip came in once and showed me a picture of when i was 19 which was during the return of the native which was quite shocking i was like okay you can put that away
1560098 i dont miss the weather i can tell you that right now laughs but i do miss my family and my friends and i get a real kick going back i actually appreciate it now more than i ever did before when you live in a place so long you always take it for granted now when i go back i have a new appreciation for it i miss the rambling hills of wales and i miss my family but im very settled where i am now
1560099 oh yeah they go home and get spoilt then it takes me three weeks to get them back to normal which is pretty much what every grandparent does to their grandkids the great thing about living in bermuda is that theyre away from all the kind of hoopla that goes on in this industry im very very cautious about that they go to school and theyre just regular kids except for my son who went to his first drama lesson and he turned to the drama teacher and said dont worry im a really good actor its in my genes oh great his first day of drama class great
1560100 until somebody actually tells me hes 25 years older i dont actually think about it its just one of those connections i really dont think about that i guess hes been through the mill a bit if he can put up with me were not vying for equal rights in our careers because hes michael douglas hes spent all his life doing that and he can take a back seat in a way and not feel so crazed about the consciousness of his career it works very well with the children him being at home and me working and vice versa
1560101 it was a bit of a blur because i gave birth nine days later i had to watch the rerun to see what i said because i had no idea just being nominated is whats important and then when you have to actually get up there and take that little statute it is pretty insane then you take it home and nothing changes
1560102 i havent actually reached my sexiest point yet laughs i dont think im going to be nora batty any time soon but obviously im not going to be rip roaring in corsets playing a 19 year old because im not one im 38 years old and im actually really lucky and glad these other roles have come along where i can play a mother this is the first time ive had a daughter actually in a movie so good or bad im not going to be playing old grannies any time soon
1560103 they spelt night wrong they released it as the dark knight learn to spell noobs
1560104 i believe spelling and grammar should play an important part in films and will not stop until this problem is rectified the film should be withdrawn from cinemas and re released as the dark night
1560105 holy sh t dude you are so right i cant believe i didnt catch this maybe you should call someone and tell them
1560106 i already have and they said they would look into it i cant believe no one noticed this before
1560107 no no no night not knight cant you tell most of this movie happened during night time very obvious
1560108 llliiiesssss everyone knows double entendre is french for sea biscuits
1560109 actually im a 40 year old english teacher who refuses to stand for this blatant disregard for proper spelling the writer of the comic book clearly did not know how to spell night
1560110 do not listen to this evil propaganda it is night not knight people who contradict this are clearly enemy spies

1560156 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama

1560158 we are looking for a clear positive response from iran and in the absence of that were going to have no choice but to pursue further measures against them
1560159 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1560160 the inflation fight probably will have to wait until 2009
1560161 conditions at this point do not seem to dictate an immediate tightening
1560162 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1560163 we will have anything to do with section 8 or government assistance housing that is not our intention

1560165 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1560166 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1560167 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1560168 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1560169 its a great ruling for the teachers and the state employees
1560170 it essentially says the government cant use the pension fund as a rainy day fund
1560171 for the court to say the governors action was not necessary is not only legally wrong but mathematically impossible
1560172 instead of seeking a tax increase or cuts in other state programs that did not enjoy special constitutional protection defendants diverted the employer contributions to the retirement system
1560173 keeps retirement funds where they should be with retirees who have dedicated their careers to serving the public
1560174 she whispered in my ear the lawyers are asking for a bargain deal
1560175 it makes the jury believe the client is guilty of some offense
1560176 it is clear that someone indicated to a juror that a plea bargain was going to be entered
1560177 i appreciate you reporting the information to the court which is exactly what you should have done
1560178 i know people who have been caught and deported but most are never caught
1560179 to turn yourself in so you can go home and live in a village with no work if i wanted to do that i would have stayed in my village i wouldnt have risked my life to come here in the first place
1560180 for them its getting too hard to hide they have the stress of looking over their shoulders
1560181 they know theres a lot of law enforcement looking for them this is their way to go home
1560182 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
1560183 theres no mind control or anything that looks good on a hollywood screen
1560184 really people make it out to be much more sinister than it is

1560188 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1560189 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1560190 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1560191 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1560192 were happy they granted the request and now were going to go about raising as much money as possible to honor his legacy and what he stood for
1560193 but remember that scholarships and community outreach are also part of our memorial funds goals so while last night the vote was all about the baseball field at central our true mission to keep larrys legacy alive is much broader in scope
1560194 they did a good job with it it benefits young people in that there are scholarship opportunities it benefits the community not only for maj bauguess but it recognizes others who died in service
1560195 he was a leader and a team player you could take 12 or 15 like that and win the state
1560196 i think he would have been really humbled and would have probably said he didnt deserve this
1560197 i think he would have been honored and proud at the same time but would probably have said you guys could have honored someone else
1560198 i always was drawn to the area of public health and nutrition
1560199 my kids were going off to college and i was ready for something different
1560200 i learned about the extension service and thought that was something i would enjoy doing
1560201 i deal with anything that has to do with family in particular anything that helps families make consumer choices
1560202 food safety and food preservation thats where extension has its niche
1560203 some days you come in and do planning for programs or you might come in and some major thing has happened and youve got calls coming in like when the powers out and people are calling to see if its still safe to keep their food
1560204 she understands how easy it is to slip away from an exercise routine
1560205 we do things like set up fruits and vegetable stations and let kids try fruits and vegetables they may have never had
1560206 we had three classes on food safety in one we did the glow germ activity we put orange lotion on their hands then had them wash their hands then we used a black light to show them what areas they missed washing
1560207 janelle saw the need to teach nutrition in the schools and she got the grant for that
1560208 she just has an impeccable work ethic she really dots every i and crosses every t
1560209 janelle is very quiet and unassuming but she has lots of innovative ideas
1560210 she really has the people of stokes at heart because shes one of them
1560211 shes very reserved but when it comes to her programs that passion really comes out
1560212 i like helping people learn new skills theres never a dull moment

1560217 in the first years of the 21st century a third world war broke out those of us who survived knew mankind could never survive a fourth that our own volatile natures could simply no longer be risked so we have created a new arm of the law the grammaton cleric whose sole task it is to seek out and eradicate the true source of mans inhumanity to man his ability to feel
1560218 be careful because the role of the joker is so demanding it can kill you
1560219 i dont know what our government does period i diagnosis hypocrisy
1560220 low informati mccain ahead of obama nationally as america wants government out of the way
1560221 i just realized from my own knowledge that some o game set and match
1560222 i dont know what our government does period i diagnosis hypocrisy
1560223 low informati hard to believe statistics from june 6 1944 d day normandy invasion
1560224 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co

1560227 this reinforces what we have long known that the gun lobby will go to any lengths no matter how unethical to protect the profits of the gun industry in this country

1560232 studies have shown that microbes can survive the shock levels of being launched into space
1560233 and as more and more organisms are discovered under extreme conditions its become more plausible that things could survive in space for the time it takes to go from one planet to another
1560234 one hundred years ago people wondered if animals could go from one land mass to another
1560235 everything that is going on on earth occurred because the meteorites happened to land here but they are obviously landing in other places
1560236 if there is another planet that has the water and all of the things that are needed for life you should be able to get the same process rolling
1560237 the universe is mostly empty space but here and there are special places where complex things can happen clouds of dust planetary surfaces comets and asteroids
1560238 this is a first class facility and a symbol of the communitys commitment to these students
1560239 that message isnt going to be lost on the graduates of this program
1560240 in the gulf of california 32 per cent of the varieties of fish and crabs with commercial importance are related to the local abundance of mangrove
1560241 our data just didnt fit the current model of damage accumulation and so we had to consider the alternative model of developmental drift
1560242 weve just seen the first big win in the fight to stabilise the worlds climate its just possible that by the end of 2008 well have something approaching a de facto moratorium on new coal plants in the us weve crossed a tipping point on this issue and its amazing how fast it has happened this could be the first big win in the effort to stabilise the earths climate
1560243 governor parry isnt an environmentalist hes doing this because it makes economic sense so is texan oilman t boone pickens hes put 10 billion in a 4 000mw wind farm in the texas panhandle
1560244 i truly believe we are moving into an era of water scarcity throughout the united states
1560245 that by itself is going to force us to adopt more efficient management techniques
1560246 the new plan would also require that mining and forestry companies consult early with aboriginal communities before starting any projects in the other half of the boreal forest and give first nations a share of revenues from new projects on their traditional lands anywhere in ontario

1560263 there have been times when someone has made an argument to me that i found compelling that i am sure began to mold and shape my thinking
1560264 having at least a person in every hundred or in every thousand who have gone through their own adjustment reaction
1560265 if you think you can do something about global warming the fighting in darfur save the whales etc then know you can do something about protecting yourself during a pandemic
1560266 well you are not in the group that will get this or that
1560267 why worry you do not think a pandemic will happen
1560268 it is not a matter of wanting to withdraw from the fight and it is not silence from cowardice the door must be open in order to go through it i pray for open doors and the strength and fortitude to proceed

1560273 it isnt just the phoenix that rises from the ashes
1560274 there is no reason to believe any moratorium on the gas tax will be passed on to consumers thats first and foremost
1560275 second it will defeat everything weve tried to do to lower the cost of oil
1560276 even then i still slip and try to hand off my calling and responsibilities in a childlike way
1560277 if you keep your feet from breaking the sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day if you call the sabbath a delight and the lords holy day honorable and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words then you will find your joy in the lord and i will cause you to ride on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father jacob

1560295 the house republican leaders plan for flood relief is an utter embarrassment and flood affected iowans should be outraged
1560296 their proposal is another major warning sign that the republican party has veered terribly to the political right and is completely out of touch with mainstream iowa

1560306 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1560307 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1560308 we have an indisputable international law obligation that conflicts with state law
1560309 the supreme court has ruled the president has neither the constitutional power nor the legislative authority to overturn the state rules
1560310 its silence is no surprise the united states has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access
1560311 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1560312 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jose medellins execution goes forward
1560313 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1560314 my view has been all along and it remains that the fed is going to be on hold for a good deal of time
1560315 we believe that the fed will be in a position to hold rates steady well into 2009
1560316 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1560317 my view is that unemployment is going to go to 6 5 percent and that will be new information for the fed that will force them to keep rates unchanged for the next 12 months

1560346 past failures create insecurities because we are analytical beings we lose self confidence each time we make wrong choices this leads to what is usually called value judging what i recommend is casting the care of insecurity upon the lord each time one fails

1560370 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1560371 clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of the year
1560372 will be continuing to make investments in bringing more programs including movies to our users in hd
1560373 everything would suggest that torrey might be the easiest major course we play this year not that it was easy but augusta and birkdale british open were impossible
1560374 if the pins are on top of all these hills it could be borderline impossible to shoot anywhere near par but if you have pins down the bottom of the slopes and the tees up they will be a bit more playable
1560375 youd have to say its harder to win when hes in the field than when hes not in the field but i dont see this as any greater opportunity than last years pga
1560376 ive never played any good at akron its one of those places that just doesnt work for me
1560377 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1560378 earlier today a grand jury here in the district of massachusetts returned an indictment charging a defendant with participating in a massive identity theft case together we have charged a total of 11 people including residents of at least five different countries with various crimes relating to the theft and resale of credit and debit card account information
1560379 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data
1560380 in many cases the effects of these crimes can be felt for years after they are committed
1560381 if you do the crime we will track you down wherever you are in the world we will arrest you and we will send you to jail
1560382 if youre using only a few open software packages youre actually using a whole lot more applications because open software builds on things other people have done
1560383 a lot of people told me i couldnt do it ive been thinking about doing a project in china for over ten years
1560384 i call it hands across the ocean the idea is to represent through aquatic art all the water on the planet and invite kids from all 205 olympic countries to join me in painting these giant monumental canvases
1560385 over a 2 week period we painted over 54 giant canvases and we put them all around this beautiful lake in central beijing and all the kids joined hands
1560386 i believe we well may have sparked and inspired that generation to become youth ambassadors for the planet
1560387 wed just like to thank wyland for thinking of us were going to use that piece of art auction it off and use it to support special olympics hawaii
1560388 i think you can see that this brand new position by hsta as one of my deputies says does not pass the laugh test
1560389 shows that the leadership never intended to implement random drug testing never did instead they have put up excuses
1560390 we have remote control systems that allow us to turn buildings on or off or turn them down during off peak times
1560391 we can reduce the pressure on the tuition dollars cause all the student tuition dollars are used to pay for energy costs here
1560392 the new 23 seer versus the 13 seer conventional air conditioner will save about 38 percent of your air conditioning cost which equates to about 100 dollars a month
1560393 so if youre in your bedroom at night the compressor ramps down to a very low speed this equates to energy savings and lower sound levels
1560394 even though they may have been quite a way down the pipeline on this project they already knew that the state highway fund is dire straights
1560395 i mean the highway department is already projecting a deficit position by 2013
1560396 i just dont think this is a very good use of money at this time especially when the economy is hurting
1560397 eighty percent of our visitors will travel down this corridor and this is the first and last impression theyll see of hawaii
1560398 we do believe its a good investment and an important one for all citizens and tourists in hawaii
1560399 im really glad to hear the state is finally doing something to cleanup and to beautify that part of nimitz highway
1560400 the fact is that containers are basically legos for big boys they fit together they stack together and basically with the design that fritz johnson the architect came up with everything fits together in a pre planned way
1560401 basically the costs that we have experienced over the past few years are about seventy percent of the cost of standard construction and thats generally due to the fact that these are used as framing
1560402 strength durability and of course this particular project will be covered in a stucco finish and a steel roof
1560403 keeping it square the containers are built exactly to size 20 feet by 8 feet wide by 8 feet high so we have to keep it squared up
1560404 yeah its actually re cycling in the truest sense of the word theres a whole lot of uses for containers but the bottom line is that otherwise theyd be filling up landfills or going to scrap
1560405 hes looking to do a lot of interesting residential applications with this and has done a couple of preliminary models already for duplexes
1560406 shortly after departure the pilot radioed that there was smoke in the cockpit and that he needed to return to lax
1560407 something didnt smell right and then some smoke came through the cabin smoke alarms went off and there was clearly a bit of panic
1560408 yes we were scared unusual sense the plane there was something burning whitish color so it had a hazy look
1560409 we were back on the ground within 50 55 minutes after takeoff
1560410 the aircraft came to a stop and as they were assessing the situation the crew made the decision to go ahead and get the aircraft deplaned as quickly as possible
1560411 no serious injuries of any sort no one transported to the hospital
1560412 cause they were expecting that he would do it in three takes but it took him only one take so they were amazed and they were proud of him
1560413 thats called a backhand spring to worm not even i can do that
1560414 she was 15 months and she was 18 pounds she couldnt walk she didnt really talk she said two words
1560415 sleepless nights i mean just screaming not being able to sleep
1560416 we kept telling them you know shes regressing she ended up back in diapers
1560417 she came home one afternoon from her visit was on the back of my couch took her panties off
1560418 they kept pushing they kept pushing the social worker kept pushing
1560419 we didnt know what was going to happen but we knew something was going to happen
1560420 she was close to death and that they were going to pull life support and that her situation is critical its just critical she has severe head injuries a part of her skull was removed and part of her frontal lobe now im asking the state is it going to be covered up again
1560421 its time to stand up it really is time this nonsense with these children being returned to parents that are not capable of taking care of their children just because theres a kinship policy may not always be the best interest of the child
1560422 it doesnt matter who inflicted the injury thats not even the point the point is shes in the hospital and there was no one there to protect her
1560423 i do not think that looking at that only piece of data is a true reflection of what goes on at our school
1560424 we need to look at those numbers of target goals and see whos performing well and whos not and see what we might do about that
1560425 we are just in study mode at this point trying to figure out exactly the state of our schools and what our recommendations will be as it relates to curriculum instruction decisions
1560426 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1560427 as a result of the governments decision apparently those children may have continued to work at the plant and presumably at least some were arrested
1560428 we were all thinking of danger while our parents were away

1560457 a escasas horas del inicio de los juegos de pek n la seguridad es una obsesi n enfermiza de las autoridades chinas pero la necesidad de reforzar las medidas de seguridad no puede convertirse en el ltimo pretexto para imponer la mordaza
1560458 tanto el cio como los gobiernos internacionales no pueden cruzarse de brazos mientras se pisotea la libertad de informaci n
1560459 nada hay que decir sobre la coherencia del principio invocado sin embargo a todas luces la decisi n carece de sentido y consecuencias pr cticas y sobre todo del don de la oportunidad
1560460 hubiera sido m s comprensible que el juez pedraz hubiera esperado unos d as m s
1560461 en un estado democr tico la libertad de expresi n es un derecho fundamental
1560462 la decisi n del coe de prohibir a los deportistas espa oles que hagan declaraciones molestas para el r gimen chino durante su estancia en los juegos bajo la amenaza de retirarles la acreditaci n supone una intolerable coacci n
1560463 resulta intolerable que un organismo como el coe avale decisiones que atentan contra principios tan elementales como el de la libertad
1560464 es de una gravedad extrema que deber a obligar al gobierno a intervenir porque el coe sumiso hasta l mites que ofenden la propia dignidad no est por encima de la ley
1560465 faltan s lo dos d as para que comiencen los juegos ol mpicos de pek n y son muchas las dudas que se ciernen sobre el pa s organizador

1560470 tiene que ser terrible mirarse al espejo y ver que eres i aki de juana chaos y salir a la calle y que la gente te reconozca como el asesino de 25 personas
1560471 si encaja o no en los supuestos del delito de enaltecimiento es algo que deber n determinar los jueces habr n de hacerlo en funci n del texto y el contexto pero no del consenso generalizado sobre la desproporci n entre los 25 asesinatos y los 18 a os de c rcel a los que se sumaron otros tres por dos delitos de amenazas
1560472 se est diciendo que si la ley no es capaz de impedir la salida de prisi n de de juana habr que cambiar la norma ya se cambi pero la modificaci n no puede aplicarse retroactivamente
1560473 de juana chaos es un individuo siniestro un verdadero asesino en serie cuya puesta en libertad en cumplimiento estricto de la ley ofende la conciencia moral y el sentido de la justicia
1560474 con la soberbia propia de quien se siente fortalecido por el dolor ajeno y tambi n con una dosis notable de imprudencia el terrorista tard s lo 48 horas en demostrar el car cter odioso de su comportamiento
1560475 es muy l gico que la audiencia perciba indicios de enaltecimiento del terrorismo en ello
1560476 hay material de sobra para poner en marcha los instrumentos legales pertinentes
1560477 el contenido de la carta no ofrece lugar a dudas
1560478 el renovado clima de consenso en pol tica antiterrorista debe traducirse a corto plazo en medidas adecuadas para evitar este tipo de situaciones la respuesta legal al terrorista excarcelado debe ser inmediata y estricta
1560479 el cumplimiento de su condena y su consiguiente salida de prisi n otorgan una indeseable notoriedad a uno de los criminales m s sanguinarios de eta por eso el principal valor del homenaje tributado ayer por el ayuntamiento de san sebasti n a las v ctimas de de juana es recordar a los ciudadanos y a las instituciones qui nes son los verdaderos protagonistas en esta historia de terror
1560480 el silencio del gobierno vasco ven a siendo clamoroso en este momento
1560481 pero las palabras de la portavoz del ejecutivo de ibarretxe escogieron la peor de las direcciones la de atribuir a la justicia el prop sito de construir nuevas imputaciones contra el ex recluso
1560482 las declaraciones de la portavoz del gobierno vasco sugiriendo de forma gratuita que el estado de derecho podr a estar haciendo trampas para devolver a la c rcel a de juana no s lo son impropias de alguien que ocupa un cargo de esa responsabilidad sino que carecen de fundamento
1560483 una vez m s el gobierno vasco y el pnv pretenden mirar para otro lado para no coger por los cuernos el verdadero problema del pa s vasco que no es ni la pol tica centralista ni la justicia sino el terrorismo de eta

1560504 q4 was a very solid quarter especially given some challenges that we are seeing in the global marketplace
1560505 we have a strong desire to close the value gap between our operating performance and the market value of our shares and therefore we will be actively looking at options to accomplish that
1560506 it was our responsibility to see whether or not there was other interest in the marketplace
1560507 in general people see the strength and value of tns but they also see in wpp somebody with a very strategic reason to buy tns and perhaps the ability to increase their price
1560508 a lot of people dont want to get into a bidding situation
1560509 we need to consider wpp and gfk from an equal standpoint

1560513 obama has always said that he supports expanded drilling in existing open areas which include offshore areas his campaign figures there are 68 million acres currently open that are not being drilled on by oil companies he opposes lifting the moratorium on drilling in the outer continental shelf
1560514 we should invest in the technology that can help us recover more from existing oil fields and speed up the process of recovering oil and gas resources in shale formations in montana and north dakota texas and arkansas and in parts of the west and central gulf of mexico
1560515 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
1560516 for too long partisan gridlock and special interest influence has blocked progress on some of the most urgent challenges facing the american people and that is especially true when it comes to our energy crisis
1560517 todays announcement includes many of the policies ive been fighting for during my time in the senate and over the course of this campaign
1560518 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
1560519 but ive always believed that finding consensus will be essential to solving our energy crisis and todays package represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning in the coming days ill be laying out additional steps i believe we must take to bring down gas prices for good and truly free ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil
1560520 he is obviously thrashing about trying to grab on to the idea and catch up to the idea for the week it is obviously belated it is haphazard
1560521 i believe senator obama has just misunderstood and under appreciated this crisis it is going to need to be dealt with boldly and aggressively
1560522 the business community of australia are sick and tired of one of the most complex tax systems in the world
1560523 we also dont play many games on grass that is another difference but it is a good place to work on individual aspects of the game and allows us to work more closely with coach ryan cubit
1560524 you come in as a freshman and you feel like you are under fire but getting young guys in on the team action is so helpful it is all about getting experience for me things are getting better i feel more comfortable and things have slowed down but there is always work to be done and that is why we are out here

1560527 the timing of these leaks is particularly curious given that senator perata is serving his final and most critical year in the senate and is one of the most prominent elected officials in state office
1560528 we ask that the department of justice take this matter seriously and open an investigation in so doing we do not take a position on the underlying investigation of senator perata but we strongly urge that you take steps to ensure that whatever actions the department of justice feels it should take based on the facts are untainted by illegal leaks or whispering campaigns
1560529 given the bush administrations well documented politicization of the justice department it doesnt surprise me congressional leaders would be interested in learning more behind the timing and motive of these leaks
1560530 i think its perfectly appropriate that they ask some tough questions
1560531 oil prices climbed 100 percent but their profit was only up 14 percent
1560532 grave concern about the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the serious impact on civilians
1560533 there is also a crisis with respect to food prices which have gone up dramatically
1560534 we need the continued support of ngos and the international community if we are to prevent further suffering it is imperative they remain committed to afghanistan the needs of its people cannot be met by the government and the un alone
1560535 increasing use of suicide bombings and other indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas and the use of civilian property from which to launch attacks
1560536 searches conducted by afghan and international forces have on some occasions involved excessive use of force extra judicial killings destruction of property and or mistreatment of suspects
1560537 commons statement shows government is finally listening to the military planners who warned iraq was a costly sideshow
1560538 would include the presence of a number of british troops continuing to train and mentor the iraqi army
1560539 that is the planning assumption in the ministry of defence and elsewhere in whitehall it is a timetable and an ambition that ties in with the hopes of the iraqi and us governments particularly if barack obama wins the american presidency in november
1560540 sustaining two theatres at the level we are at the moment is a stretch on us
1560541 it will be a longer haul in afghanistan let us acknowledge that this is a long term and challenging enterprise we know that in afghanistan we are engaged in a generational struggle
1560542 overall finance approvals are now down a quarter since its peak earlier in the year
1560543 this obviously has been a key part of the reserve bank thinking
1560544 they would have had this data on hand with their decision yesterday
1560545 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1560546 falls in approvals are on a par with previous cycles
1560547 but it is much more concentrated in purchase for established dwellings
1560548 to have a 25 per cent fall in finance approvals in five months would have them a little bit worried
1560549 the deceleration is much more abrupt than they would like
1560550 as a leading indicator of building approvals and commencements the series suggest further weakness with housing likely to detract from activity in 2008 and into 2009
1560551 the construction sector is one of the largest employers accounting for around 10 per cent of total employment with the related property amp business services accounting for 12 per cent of total employment

1560555 spiralling food prices tipping millions in east africa towards catastrophe
1560556 this is a catastrophe in the making we have time to act before it becomes a reality the cost of food has escalated by up to 500 percent in some places people are increasingly becoming desperate we fear that the worst could be yet to come as the crisis deteriorates across east africa
1560557 somalia is at a dire crossroads if sufficient food and other humanitarian assistance cannot be scaled up in the coming months parts of the country could well be in the grips of a disaster similar to the 1992 1993 famine when hundreds of thousands of people perished
1560558 official estimates from donor agencies following recent nationwide assessments put the figure closer to 8 10 million people
1560559 the uns office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in ethiopia warns that the country is facing critical challenges those living in drought affected areas are resorting to extreme measures including slaughtering animals eating seeds meant for planting and migrating from their homes
1560560 ethiopia somalia northern kenya and uganda are the worst hit areas with around 17 million people in need of emergency food aid drought poor harvests and the continuing rises in food prices are the main factors driving a worsening humanitarian situation
1560561 if the current rainy season is also poor and the next harvest in a few months time also fails the crisis will become catastrophic in many areas there is a shortage of seeds to plant the next harvest food on sale at markets is unaffordable and livestock lacks grazing land
1560562 there is already an urgent need to help those faced with severe hunger now it is also equally important to act fast to help people to secure their next harvest and to maintain healthy livestock to prevent the crisis from deteriorating further
1560563 a perfect storm has now arisen long term problems affecting agricultural production have been exacerbated by other factors sending global food prices soaring and causing acute shortages of staple foods in at least 37 countries
1560564 in the first three months of 2008 all major food commodities hit their highest price in real terms for nearly 30 years
1560565 farmers have no access to credit so when prices go up they cant afford to plant
1560566 across sub saharan africa more erratic rainfall has led to drought and frequent crop failure evidence that the climate is changing is unequivocal
1560567 biofuel policies in some advanced economies are spilling over to the price of key food items particularly corn and soya bean imf estimates suggest that increased demand for biofuels accounts for 70 percent of the increase in corn prices and 40 per cent of the increase in soya bean prices
1560568 you have asked the question are institutional investors contributing to food and energy price inflation and my unequivocal answer is yes what we are experiencing is a demand shock coming from a new participant in the commodities futures market institutional investors
1560569 so popular has this form of trading become that several banks including barclays and deutsche bank have launched agricultural commodity index funds
1560570 the most productive land is then used to grow these crops squeezing out domestic food producers although the intention has been to raise the income of marginal producers such crops have reduced agricultural diversity and left countries reliant on importing staples

1560577 we seek negotiations based on legal principles leading to practical outcomes

1560579 mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with bright prospects
1560580 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
1560581 in the absence of a positive response we have no choice but to pursue further measures
1560582 could drive crude oil prices to more than 300 a barrel which even over a short period would be cataclysmic to the global economy and stock markets
1560583 there is uniformity across the us government about the way to proceed with iran everyone from this white house including the vice presidents office is in agreement that the military option is not the best option at this point and we should pursue diplomatic and economic pressures
1560584 the one plan that interested me the most was why dont we build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans thats the level of stuff were talking about provocation

1560586 i have imposed the foot patrols the young soldiers are very experienced they have been used in peace missions where they are confronted with situations which are more problematic than those to be found in our cities
1560587 lets do it this way we decide a law which envisages taking all fingerprints in order to dissociate us from the slightest suspicion of racism in the course of implementation priorities will be established and it could be that we find the fingerprints of roma children amongst the most urgent cases
1560588 a diversion to distract italians from the consequences of government measures which are crippling the country and its weakest layers
1560589 kids come to school from homes that have all sorts of problems and this affects their learning
1560590 sometimes there are drunks at home and there is no money no food no transport and no school bus
1560591 what we need is breakfast programs and support for kids to have uniforms and for stationery
1560592 at the moment there no holiday programs here for kids and no support for young people
1560593 i always remembered this and would never send my own kids to school without a meal
1560594 if we had money difficulties i would say stay home and if the kids had problems at school i wouldnt let them go until we talked it out people who just talk to you about your problems at school dont really understand this predicament
1560595 needs indigenous health workers who can speak to the kids in their language and see exactly what the problems are they can then take this back to the parents and tell them that they need to attend congress local aboriginal health clinic or the hospital

1560606 essentially humes criticism of the argument from design is that it leads in all its forms to blatantly chomsky conclusions

1560619 some think qualia should be quined or fostered but i think they should be wittgenstoned
1560620 he argued that on my view i dont know that im in pain but since hes not a good kripkographer i managed to outsmart him with a wittgenstone
1560621 we understand the words but not what it has to do with anything
1560622 i live here i just was wondering what was happening on my street

1560624 the house is staffed and operated by 25 volunteers some of whom were formerly homeless themselves the homeless women who stay there come form all walks of life races and religious faiths they range in age from 13 to 91 the sancta maria house provides beds for 10 women each night guests arrive at 7 in the evening and leave the next day at 8 after being served breakfast each guest can stay up to 7 nights in the month
1560625 ive worked with a lot of artists em and they all have a need that cannot be met by another human being
1560626 im not surprised that there is still unsatisfied demand out there there is demand but at what price
1560627 either this product is very good and underpriced or there was a lot of pre marketing efforts but which developer right now would not sell its product at a higher price if they can
1560628 for example they could tell their agents to go and source for potential customers with the cheques all lined up within the two hours they just do the administrative work
1560629 especially the tight pants and all the big muscles but i just couldnt understand why they were killing each other over 25 cents

1560636 they had no other duties for three years except to solve this case i told joan berry it would be solved and it was on aug 8 tyree will realize that he ran against jimmy jones and not tim hutchison
1560637 its a very significant kind of thing we are seeing
1560638 things are looking good now and if nothing else changes prices should continue to go down but developments around the world could change that anytime however now it is a welcome relief

1560641 con esta medida no s lo estaremos asegurando el respeto por los animales sino que adem s generaremos conciencia sobre la necesidad de cuidarlos y otorgarles un buen trato

1560651 wertiger denn je definiert die nun sechste golf generation das qualit ts und komfortniveau seiner klasse in weiten teilen v llig neu
1560652 wir kennen unsere golf kunden gerade beim kernmodell darf man da nicht zu viel riskieren sonst vergrault man die treuen k ufer
1560653 wir haben die kernelemente des golf in eine pr zise neue form gegossen
1560654 er ist akzentuierter dreidimensionaler als seine vorg nger mit exakt definierten linien und kanten mit fein proportionierten w lbungen und hohlkehlen
1560655 jedes detail ist kompromisslos darauf ausgerichtet die wertigkeit zu verbessern
1560656 of course the professional will not send their kids to the local schools with all the native brown kids no their child is too good talented gifted and needs to go to a school with majority white
1560657 all known wells within a one mile radius of the solway mulch facility were tested
1560658 the lab is not approved on drinking water samples for running anything but bacteria
1560659 were glad the county went out and did the testing the commissioners who wanted to call a special meeting to terminate our contract should gather facts first
1560660 we need to make sure we test the water quality under a variety of conditions to make certain
1560661 i still think there are issues here i dont think all of the information was presented to us to make a decision about renewing the contract
1560662 the guy made the offer to ed to get another car for him
1560663 ed didnt actually direct him to go steal one he just told him that he could handle any cars he brought in if we know someone is going to commit a violent crime were going to stop them period
1560664 fekete cocked the gun pointed it at hughes face and told hughes that if he did not hand over his keys fekete would blow his expletive head off
1560665 obviously he wants me out of the way as soon as possible
1560666 this lawsuit is pursued by a man who has filed over 80 lawsuits against knox county government our elected officials and our employees over the last 10 years this is pursued by a man who has recently been found to be unfit to practice law in the federal court this is pursued by a man who the chief federal court judge has declared to be an immediate danger to the public a judge who has suspended moncier from practicing law in federal court for the next seven years
1560667 i think its better for an orderly transition into office and i dont see the necessity of the law director taking office early
1560668 a person who is appointed to an office is appointed until a next election that is different from a person who is elected to an office that starts on sept 1
1560669 i dont understand the rush to be sworn in early for basically 10 or 11 days
1560670 we went through the appointment process and put our resumes out there the candidates that won the primary in the 4th district were asked to step in and serve and they chose not to they didnt want to be tainted with the appointment we tried to bring civility and diversity to the commission
1560671 i will serve at the will of the people im not so certain that our charter explicitly states that officers should take office as soon as the election is certified im not going to be upset if im not at the last meeting
1560672 you dont have the base of information to make intelligent decisions
1560673 personally im doing all i can as a commissioner i would be glad to serve
1560674 i would acquiesce to what their wishes are if they wish to be sworn in sept 1 thats fine
1560675 these are people who are actually signed up and are under block captains
1560676 we chase people out of the neighborhood who dont belong here
1560677 since the watch has been started we get better police patrols
1560678 from small gatherings of a few people on someones porch to large parties attended by a couple of hundred residents in some of the citys larger neighborhoods
1560679 obviously officers cant be everywhere we rely on neighborhood watch groups to be our eyes and ears
1560680 they send a message to criminals that the neighborhoods are organized and wont tolerate them
1560681 i love to try different things and this is just fun to do
1560682 you just fill the jar with water add the herbs and let sit in the sun eight to 10 hours
1560683 you can use a combination of herbs or just one kind to blend with them
1560684 when you blend the tea with fruit juices you make an herbal fruit cooler
1560685 i love using any of the lemon herbs in vodka
1560686 they collect dust in the garden so several rinsings and removing bad leaves before they are used is very important
1560687 if you prefer you can put fruit in the center of the ice ring
1560688 i really enjoy judging domestically more than i enjoy judging internationally
1560689 i enjoy making the trips and seeing other countries the act of judging internationally i dont know that id say thats fun it has a lot more stress to it
1560690 when you judge internationally and youre way off from your panel of judges youre going to look like youre cheating or look like you dont know whats going on and your panel may not be judging on the up and up you have to work with the panel internationally more than just i have the right score domestically its more cut and dry when we judge internationally theres nothing cut and dry about it
1560691 when youre judging internationally you dont want to be singled out
1560692 people ask will we see you a lot on tv will they have the camera on you im like lets hope not because if they do and its not a glancing look at me then theres trouble
1560693 on different days ill be at different events its totally random
1560694 i really want to see them hit on all cylinders
1560695 we explained that it was our desire to remain customers of lcub but that we could not absorb an increase of over 8 000 per week
1560696 theyre asking us to pay five times as much as our competitors
1560697 we are in a very competitive market we just cant afford to pay that much more
1560698 in reality the rate increase was more than double what the board was told
1560699 lcub told us that we just needed to go up on what we charge for sausage
1560700 unlike lcub we have competition and our customers have the ability to make choices
1560701 were trying to make the rate system as fair as we can
1560702 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1560703 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1560704 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1560705 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1560706 dear friends as many of you know sarah fink is pregnant with twins she is 26 weeks along and has begun having problems shes been placed on bedrest graham is two and they have need for childcare and a few meals especially in the next two weeks when sarahs mom comes to help weve set up a nifty care calendar it is an efficient way to match their needs with peoples offers if youd like to help please follow the guidelines below the helper logon is used by family and friends that would like to sign up to help a loved one to access sarah and david finks personal carecalendar site visit calendar id 5731 security code 1314 thank you for loving them in this way their hope is that the babies will wait another 6 8 weeks before meeting you all lets pray together for that i am the coordinator for this

1560718 weve been so dry flooding hasnt been much of an issue
1560719 were prepared to identify problems identify resources and supply those resources if needed
1560720 i think post storm is the time communities really need to come together and people need to be surrounded by their peers
1560721 thats what im trying to allow here allow people to tell a good story or a bad story but everybody has a story that has to be told
1560722 its just now starting to recede at one point it was up to four feet in the front yard
1560723 the van is going to be one of those insurance cases

1560725 i would like to be able to use my central air and not worry about air conditioning and not worry about the heat index
1560726 the high bills in texas demonstrate what a huge mistake deregulation has been
1560727 the legislature created this monster and only they can change it but they wont unless they hear from citizens
1560728 i think theyre coming to the conclusion that these prices arent about deregulation and the market its about natural gas prices and limiting of other options of producing power like limits on coal and nuclear
1560729 we will see the benefits in time and you cant go back on deregulation
1560730 i went into combustible mode i almost vanished man i almost just lit up
1560731 were challenging state legislators to come up with solutions and reject calls from electricity companies and others who want to blame customers for the failure of deregulation
1560732 most of txu energys customers in north texas already have protection from price increases through these hot summer months so were focused on helping customers manage their bills by lowering their consumption
1560733 it would be painful to have a 400 bill just for cool air
1560734 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1560735 that intersection has flooded all my life but with the new drainage project kicked in it didnt flood
1560736 in terms of feedstock we do have a supply of crude in tanks that will enable us to continue running for the foreseeable future
1560737 we had very little rain and a breeze of 5 to 10 mph
1560738 weve had worse thunderstorms than this like the squall that came through sunday night

1560775 the majority of the cancer patients in this country die because of chemotherapy which does not cure breast colon or lung cancer this has been documented for over a decade and nevertheless doctors still utilize chemotherapy to fight these tumors

1560780 the problem is that now its all about consumption this spirit that has engulfed everybody
1560781 people prefer to consume everything the simplest things and the faster the better books are something that force you to think reading books requires some effort but they prefer entertainment

1560790 perhaps my purpose on earth is to give out light until i die
1560791 our sacred lands are all that remain keeping us connected to our place on mother earth to our spirituality our heritage and our lands whats left of them if they take it all away what will remain except a vague memory of a past so forgotten

1560798 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1560799 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1560800 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1560801 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1560802 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains

1560822 the economy only puts more pressure on people to save money and conserve resources
1560823 when i was at wild oats colorado springs was always a great market for us our strategy of offering natural foods at affordable prices fits well with the more priceconscious consumer in colorado springs
1560824 there are a lot of opportunities in colorado we are 20 to 30 percent cheaper smaller and easier to shop and we are finding that our format is doing especially well in this economic climate

1560833 as far as we know foreigners staged and gathered illegally and we express our strong opposition to that the olympic games is a grand sporting gathering and we will resist all attempts to politicise the olympics
1560834 we have laws regarding assembly and demonstrations and we hope that foreigners would respect the laws of china

1560836 small business cooperative for healthcare options to improve coverage for employees act
1560837 consumers employers and taxpayers pay millions of dollars each year in health care premiums in exchange for a promise to protect them from unexpected bills when a health emergency strikes
1560838 is a terrible and unfair practice that must be stopped
1560839 it places inappropriate medical costs squarely on consumers shoulders and increases health care costs for everyone further illustrating our broken health care system and the need for comprehensive reform
1560840 this frivolous suit is not about the actions of one provider but the failure of the dmhc to do its job to regulate hmos and provide assistance to providers who have the right to be reimbursed properly for emergency services rendered to hmo enrollees
1560841 some of these measures require additional work but the agency will come back to these and others each year
1560842 we are working hard to improve quality and efficiency but simply not paying for complications or conditions that while regrettable are not entirely preventable is not the way to do it
1560843 all sources of funding for the institute would sunset after 10 years that way congress could review a report from comptroller general on the value of the research to the public and private insurance sectors
1560844 a future congress may decide to incorporate these factors into the institutes research down the road
1560845 america is often described as providing the best healthcare in the world however experts tell us that as much as 30 cents of every health care dollar pays for care which is ineffective inappropriate or redundant
1560846 in fact research shows only about half of treatments for chronic care conform to medical literature there is simply not enough information on what medical treatments work best
1560847 these are people who with modern therapies can be kept out of trouble
1560848 a lot of people are suffering from a lack of health insurance
1560849 for some of the 11 4 million uninsured americans with serious chronic conditions access to care seems to be unobtainable many may face early disability and death as a result
1560850 the individual market really is the worst place to buy insurance
1560851 people cant band together to take advantage of greater bargaining power in groups and as a result of that they pay more to get less
1560852 it is quite difficult to understand all the provisions limitations and features of policies
1560853 who would want to read someone s dreary blog anyway

1560856 we will continue to provide services whether we get paid or not
1560857 we have to keep providing the services no matter what
1560858 we just have to keep seeing people whether we get paid or not
1560859 right now a hospital loses about 22 cents on every dollar of care to a medi cal patient
1560860 next to education the state health system is the second largest component of the state budget
1560861 if providers stop seeing patients and those patients end up in the emergency room that means wait times for everyone will be even longer
1560862 i hope that our elected officials can reach a resolution to this and the

1560867 her own exhortation to her supporters plus the sense of urgency about doing everything we can to help barack obama become the next president of the united states has motivated an awful lot of us
1560868 we all wanted to make a dramatic statement that were with him every step of the way
1560869 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people

1560883 my religion says its wrong they will rot in hell and they are not influencing my children
1560884 na o e civiliza o nos tr picos o ihgb e o projeto de uma hist ria nacional
1560885 i have done everything i know how to do my dog still isnt behaving i am soooo frustrated ps its all his fault
1560886 and walk away or youve shown him a million times what to do and he still doesnt get it obviously he cant be too bright
1560887 obviously because theyre describing a black shoe this does not match with any of the running shoes that we have found so far
1560888 this would presumably indicate that the foot belongs to a new missing person
1560889 i dont rule that out being part of the ones they found in canada
1560890 once it hits the straits of juan de fuca and it had an outgoing tide if it was carrying it out to the open water and it hit a strong west wind it could kick it out
1560891 so i dont rule it out we find things on beaches all the time that come from all over the world so who knows
1560892 well be consulting with oceanographers yet again to see if that is a possibility and we will be comparing the information obtained from the sherrifs department with our list of missing persons to see if we can make a possible link
1560893 theres a couple of things that come to mind immediately
1560894 in the last couple of years weve had these tsunamis where thousands of people have died you cant help but think is it related to the tsunamis
1560895 we dont sense a desire on the part of management to work towards a quick resolution
1560896 he said 60 so i bought the laptop from him for 60
1560897 i kind of roughly pieced it together i figured he was the guy who was the victim
1560898 he seemed like such a nice guy when i talked to him he was not mean or fidgety or anything he had like no emotion to him but he didnt seem like he was a very nasty guy he just seemed calm and normal
1560899 cutting body parts from the victim and eating those body parts
1560900 in a very low tone of voice indicated that he is guilty
1560901 this is a serious matter and you should have the opportunity to speak to a lawyer
1560902 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1560903 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1560904 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes
1560905 the fbi had asked everybody to sign these nondisclosure things
1560906 i think im the only person at usamriid who didnt get polygraphed
1560907 one person said hed sit at his desk and weep
1560908 at this point he provided essentially no biographical data about himself before 1993
1560909 in connection with a missing person report back in the early 1990s
1560910 our experience tells us hes more of a schemer than someone who has lost his memory
1560911 he loves his daughter kidnapping doesnt apply it was his own kid
1560912 just because hes reighs natural father it doesnt absolve him
1560913 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra
1560914 if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1560915 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1560916 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling
1560917 its so venal in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1560918 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa
1560919 obviously theyre hearing our footsteps frankly i think its a waste of their money
1560920 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary
1560921 security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1560922 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1560923 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1560924 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1560925 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me
1560926 were just trying to figure out what that reason was
1560927 i think it was about security and security acting overzealous and security singling out a black reporter to be removed
1560928 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy

1560933 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1560934 based on the context of the entire label we agree that the phrase in question refers to the brand name of the product and does not mislead consumers
1560935 behind the lifesaver like a little kid who hides behind a curtain and doesnt realize his toes are sticking out
1560936 she was so busy snapping pictures she forgot to bring the ladder up
1560937 the people got up and looked around and saw the mountain lions tail leaving the house
1560938 it is kind of strange for a large predator like that to come that close to the house
1560939 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy

1560951 igg was going off and the montreal people were pumped up
1560952 when the construction is complete travel on the highway will be safer and more reliable for tourists residents and truckers
1560953 and there will be fewer traffic tie ups on this crucial national commercial transportation artery
1560954 upgrading the trans canada highway from coast to coast is one of our highest priorities
1560955 and todays announcement is an important step forward in that plan
1560956 fencing of the new sections when theyre complete and the overpass and underpass structures for wildlife will improve mobility of the animals from one side of the valley to the other
1560957 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1560958 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a non story
1560959 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1560960 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged
1560961 i also want to take this time to extend an olive branch to police chief keith mccaskill so we can sit at a table and talk about how we are going to reduce not only crime but the killing sprees that seem to be enjoyed by the winnipeg police service
1560962 it looks like the winnipeg police service is acting like the top dog or the no 1 gang in the city of winnipeg
1560963 we all learned from the aboriginal justice inquiry one of the things we learned was not to draw conclusions on an instant or release details prior to the completion of an investigation doing so compromised the investigative process and many believe tainted the outcome of that investigation
1560964 it is unacceptable for the police to have killed our youth

1561119 i was dragging my shepherd with one of these bulldogs attached to it
1561120 i mean these dogs were huge and they were aggressive
1561121 i walked down the street and as soon as the one dog saw me he came right at me
1561122 you have a right to protect yourself and your animals on your property
1561123 versus in this situation walking down the street thats what makes this case difficult
1561124 in some respects the bush administration is simply following a familiar path by responding to real dangers with illegal and deplorable methods
1561125 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble
1561126 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own
1561127 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia
1561128 brenda wineapple brings a scholars diligence and a novelists imagination to her account of dickinson and higginsons relationship crafting a tour de force that should delight specialists and casual readers alike the books individual strands of inquiry higginsons life dickinsons poems the letters that passed between them and the historical political and artistic contexts of the age are interesting in and of themselves but when intertwined so as to inform and strengthen each other theyre fascinating
1561129 a good and happy child is so well done that part of me wishes i had missed it i like to sleep soundly at night
1561130 this sly and discombobulating flight of whimsy by david deans is in a sense a book length joke and nothing drains the humor from a good joke as effectively as vivisecting it has comenius hallucinated his transformation and if so where did he acquire his knowledge of kafka and rilke of orpheus and lady macbeth is bob a good guy after all is he even out of town let alone in mexico and where is miss scarlett anyway mr deans may or may not provide the answers to these queries but the readers irresistible desire to know is evidence that hes pulled off a splendid joke
1561131 despite its specific american flavors travel writing seems most like a contemporary french novel such as those by christian oster and gregoire bouillier a book in which an atmosphere of established and almost enviable dailiness underwrites sophisticated narrative conceits truth matters less than the telling and that makes for a cool easy kind of fiction its not hemingway or borges or even dashiell hammett but its nice
1561132 have i raved enough i feel as if im barrys publicist or agent maybe shell give me a cut of the 2 million but i did love this book it didnt matter if i was in a bad mood or tired or had other things to do i wanted to read this book i wanted to be living in these characters minds hanging out in salem or on yellow dog island does the novel deserve the hype i certainly dont begrudge it
1561133 the now forgotten us immigrants to the soviet union in the early thirties were communist sympathisers or more often desperate victims of the depression at first they were feted waves of repression however ensured that they and their descendants ended up either in russias prisons or as inmates of the gulag this is a powerful important and highly readable book the gulag is no novelty but tzouliadis brilliantly links high politics to the torment of innocents adding devastating detail
1561134 the process of government can be annoying in its obsessive repetition of its main theme in its lack of interest in empirical evidence and yet its one of those rare books which change the way you look at the world
1561135 it would be difficult to find any precedent in american history for the scale brutality and illegality of the torture and degradation inflicted on detainees over the last six years
1561136 it would be even harder to imagine a set of policies more likely to increase the dangers facing the united states and the world

1561145 the man was lying on his side and started screaming a mate of his jumped off his bike and ran to his side there was pieces of shattered glass everywhere cara ran back inside to grab a phone and other neighbours in the unit came out to see what the noise was i looked down and had a look at his arm hed managed to cut a 5 centimetre gash in his right arm triceps i had a brief look to see if there was any glass still lodged in his arm he was lucky he hadnt hit an artery one of my neighbours grabbed a towel from his garage and we started wrapping around his arm this is when it became apparent it wasnt going to be so simple the man was drunk and clearly upset looking to my left i noticed what had caused the injury hed punched a hole through a solid glass window and managed to drag his arm on a piece of glass when he pulled it out the cut in his arm must have gone almost to the bone and even though he was lucky he didnt hit an artery i did wish that he would have lost more blood it would have shut him up quicker cara called the ambulance and the police via 000 and considering were so close to a hospital i thought for sure the meat wagon would arrive before the cops the drunken man stumbled around towards us refusing to sit down his mate was holding on to the towel wrapped around his arm and trying to calm him but really the guy just wanted us to kill him dripping blood everywhere he just kept on shouting at us to cut his head off calling us cowards when that wasnt going to happen he kept asking his mate to take care of his kid cause he was gonna cap himself reasoning with him was impossible all i could do was try and keep him calm by focusing on his friend im so happy that his mate was there to try and hold on to him because i doubt we would have been able to contain him before help arrived he kept starting to walk off and i called him back just a hundred metres down the road was the park with kids playing soccer at night i didnt really want to have to deal with him down there turns out his girlfriend lived next door and she was part of the reason on this drunken self destructive rampage luckily for her she was smart enough not to come outside during this ordeal not one not two but three police cruisers rock up almost simultaneously about 20 minutes from the call i approached them and explained the situation and how deranged this guy was trying to make sure they didnt aggravate him further he kept yelling at his mate who was still holding on to the towel on his arm to run away so he wouldnt get into trouble from the police his mate just kept telling him im sorry micky but i love you too much to let you go

1561147 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1561148 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1561149 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1561150 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1561151 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1561152 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1561153 even you yesterday you had to ask me where it was at i couldnt believe after all these years you didnt know me any better than that
1561154 iran already stopped nuclear enrichment at the behest of europe for more than a year a reference to tehrans suspension of enrichment between late 2003 and mid 2005 to allow negotiations with the and what happened nothing
1561155 to place a verifiable cap on iranian enrichment and other nuclear capabilities well short of weaponization
1561156 no evidence that iran was working actively to build nuclear weapons
1561157 with the shah we also came to the conclusion that iran was in great need of nuclear energy because our population was steadily growing and our gas and oil will run out thats why even though i was in the old regime i should be fair to the new regime because they are following the same line to speak frankly with its bellicose behavior the west is pushing iran towards nuclear weapons even if they dont want them now
1561158 at the time of the shah we signed contracts with both france and germany and even then they didnt deliver if i were in the current regime i wouldnt trust the west they dont even give iran civilian airplane parts which is costing hundreds of lives why should they believe that they will give them enriched uranium
1561159 for years now they are threatening us with an attack
1561160 these guys are ants when the time comes you crush them
1561161 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1561162 theyve hit the ball back we must analyse whether its just another way to gain time or if its serious
1561163 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1561164 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1561165 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1561166 they have a very weak economy at this point which depends almost entirely on their oil revenue

1561173 political and economic indicators suggest that this years election is setting up to be one of the most defining elections in decades perhaps resembling elections of 1980 more than 1992
1561174 what were seeing statewide and nationally is a very angry electorate its very angry at incumbents and the status quo in a way we havent seen since the watergate years
1561175 i think the big difference was that the electorate was able to see that my opponent did not have the experience i had
1561176 theres a huge difference between being a city prosecutor and a state prosecutor
1561177 the sign only makes sense if a motorist is entering i 435 eastbound from the antioch road ramp
1561178 it is quite confusing to the tens of thousands of daily motorists that are already headed eastbound on i 435 most importantly im concerned that the confusion created by the sign may lead to traffic accidents
1561179 after reviewing the exit sign for metcalf avenue it does appear that the arrow in question for north metcalf can cause confusion for the driver as to which lane to take
1561180 i wanted this subject to get a full public airing and start a dialogue
1561181 this is more than symbolic we can do more if we work together
1561182 i dont know if i can answer that question i believe there is value in showing him mercy even though he may not deserve it
1561183 there were substantial things that happened to him that were beyond his control
1561184 those are reasons to consider the life option to consider mercy
1561185 did he show mercy to marsha did he show mercy to michelle did he show mercy
1561186 sometimes i dont think i care about no one i dont care about anybody i dont care about myself and other times i hate that i care so much im sorry i dont know what to say
1561187 the vote demonstrates that our citizens understand that sales taxes are the fairest way to pay for critical public safety services we appreciate the public vote of confidence
1561188 why would you not want those outsiders to pay for the jail
1561189 the bottom line is that voters in johnson county have confidence in county government they knew that the expanded jail new juvenile services complex and expanded crime lab were needed
1561190 they saw through the noise and voted for a reasonable plan
1561191 boxed voters into an artificial crisis that says either you pass this particular sales tax proposal that lasts forever or your property taxes will be raised
1561192 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster

1561194 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
1561195 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
1561196 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
1561197 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
1561198 he was always interested in new things something he was reading about
1561199 it was a cute little sense of humor that you almost missed
1561200 he had the most wonderful laugh good and clear you knew it came from the heart

1561303 these are not light switch moments what you have is more of a rheostat many many rheostat moments where in small areas local areas districts and eventually provinces there is an ongoing transition and has been an ongoing transition for the iraqi forces to step more into the lead and the coalition forces to step back and provide enablers

1561312 sen obama is not just tacking gently toward the center hes lurching right when it suits him hes zigging with the kind of reckless abandon thats guaranteed to cause disillusion if not whiplash
1561313 im thrilled with this obamas strength in the northeast the west coast and the great lakes

1561320 ive been covering presidential campaigns since 1960 i have always said i have never seen the media as much entranced by a candidate than when they were in my very first campaign in 1960 when they were for jfk but im telling you right now the enchantment with obama beats the jfk syndrome

1561335 well we walked the red carpet we mingled with the celebrities and stuff and just talked about cuur and what it does sponsoring a great cause it was really fun it was awesome
1561336 thats how i see a model walking down the runway its so deep its not shallow at all someone instilled some kind of confidence in them or they wouldnt be there and who knows who it was but its a beautiful personal thing for me to see that

1561355 the federal government shall not adopt any policies that transfer income resources from some americans to other americans
1561356 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
1561357 he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills
1561358 indeed when i come to the children of israel and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they say to me what is his name what shall i say to them
1561359 thus you shall say to the children of israel i am has sent me to you
1561360 job is to think about the national security interest as a whole the generals job is just to get their job done in iraq
1561361 pride indeed is the cardinal vice it swings open the door to most of the other theological vices and undermines the classical virtues of prudence courage and justice it thrives not on what one has but on what others do not have and even when one has diligently practiced the most admirable virtues there always lurks the danger that at some moment one will look in the mirror and say oh my what a wonderful person i am thus does the vice lunge from its hiding place
1561362 he could have just said he doesnt look like other presidents even that is a little too cute for the nasty little point he slyly was trying to make but at least he would be identifying himself merely with the universe of american presidents but his overweening pride found such company too base and demeaning for him so he needed to include himself in the grander company of george washington abe lincoln jefferson and perhaps andy jackson
1561363 more precious than peace the cold war and the struggle for the third world
1561364 we will be covering several vast areas of what is basically wilderness and then there are the flights over water
1561365 we want our support team to know exactly where we are and what sort of progress we are making
1561366 this is an exciting adventure because it is a mix of endurance for both man and machine taking place on a global stage and we feel privileged to have been chosen to be a part of it
1561367 we have now been involved in several expeditions where people have pushed themselves to the limit in difficult conditions and this one will be no different in terms of what we want to deliver in the way of providing a world class tracking system
1561368 he has not provided any detail as to what he has done with the 4m received between july 1 2004 and june 30 2007 including the 576 000 in issue in this case along with some 1 6 million in advances from the trust since march 2000
1561369 the good news is we think weve got security footage so lets see if we will work our way through it
1561370 police now believe the attack was not a random event
1561371 there is no particular threat to public safety from those responsible
1561372 its the strongest showing weve had since god knows how long
1561373 the market got excited because the us federal reserve said it would hold rates where they are which is a good thing
1561374 and now of course the reserve bank here has alluded to a cut at some stage in the future
1561375 clients have been battered and are still shaking their heads a little bit dazed and hoping there are better days around the corner
1561376 if we had some sunny days ahead of us then i think they will start to pay attention again
1561377 i think so she has someone now and i forgive her
1561378 maybe later right now lets pick up where we left off
1561379 my boss recommended me for a cruise control after i jumped up and down on couch professing my love for a girl who reminds me of sloth from
1561380 its a good thing that teeny bopper was there to cover me after my boob popped out all i had on was a janet tab
1561381 yeah i whacked my ex wife but i left my juicers at the scene i hope i dont get caught
1561382 yeah she gave me a lewinsky and i almost got impeached for it the bitch
1561383 no i never used rockets when pitching in the major leagues
1561384 oh yeah i travel through stevens tubes all the time i especially like wikipedia
1561385 thats a good thing so long as there are any organs left
1561386 sisterhood of the travelling pants 3 colossal catastrophe on cannibal island
1561387 you aint got to like me but i aint gonna grow tits for you to respect my opinion too
1561388 ill respond with one word idiotic why would any spirit filled christian recommend the world to anyone according to the dictionary psychology is the study of the mind and of mental and emotional processes and human behavior i can sum it all up in one word sin we are born in sin we are ruled by sin we act in sin we react in sin we are sinners who need a savior the only answer is the power of god christ and him crucified only then can we be changed ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god
1561389 but its disappointing because i take a lot of pride in what i do
1561390 were packing and im trying to collect things here i dont know what the situation will be
1561391 last year i put up most of my numbers in the second half if you look at what i did last year and look that ive been hitting better lately it doesnt take much to see that im starting to get into a good groove
1561392 vidro wound up in a tough spot like richie sexson
1561393 we are looking to 2009 with bryan lahair at first base and now wladimir
1561394 it was very interesting to me to look at the faces of those at the conference many many of which were somber sad and tense in contrast the faces of lgbt people and our allies looked joyful happy even radiant i wondered which vision of the church are people drawn to that which produces a solemn and morose countenance or one which produces joy and radiance gay and lesbian christians know what it is like to be rescued from shame and guilt and to walk in the light of gods redeeming love and seem to show it every moment thats the church i want to be in dont you
1561395 hes a real strong kid beyond his years and is putting those advantages to use
1561396 it looks to me like some clubs missed the boat on him
1561397 i knew seattle got in on him early and sometimes thats what it takes but he might end up a special hitter and if that happens their international scouts deserve kudos he was the best talent ive seen down here from an offensive standpoint
1561398 good bat speed punished mistakes and hes pretty athletic over at third base he has a lot of raw skills that need a lot of smoothing out but every kid that age needs a metric ton of experience to develop consistencies in their game
1561399 you want them to be aggressive but you cant have them hacking and swinging at pitches they cant handle or chasing balls out of the zone de jesus takes a pretty big swing but hes displayed the aptitude of a more mature hitter in terms of getting pitches he can drive even if it means taking his base
1561400 but its the same with all other talents at all other levels you have to weigh the numbers against the other factors ballpark size competition and sample size hes been hitting for more than a month so its probably somewhat safe to say he can hit at least some right
1561401 but the evaluation comes in his tools does he have the strength and swing to continue to hit for power as he progresses does he make adjustments within a game that shows his intelligence at the plate de jesus is doing that as much as anyone else down here and i really like his wrists and that swing for such a young player hes raw its obviously early in his career but all of the evidence available right now points to him being a player that can continue to hit hit with power and get better every step of the way
1561402 he should be in triple a by now he might be the mvp of the southern league
1561403 as soon as he gets comfortable in the big leagues the numbers will translate he does everything you want a power bat to do
1561404 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
1561405 the first officer to enter the house after breaking down the main gate pointed a pistol at the christians and ordered them to hand over their resident permits and mobile phones
1561406 the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house the confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books
1561407 they later changed the charge to holding a dance party and collecting money to support terrorism
1561408 during the raid the police mocked questioned and harassed the christians for four hours
1561409 then they took them to a police station where the head of the station interrogated them the head of the police then wrote down their statements in arabic and forced the christians who are immigrants and not able to read or write arabic to sign the statements
1561410 three weeks ago saudi arabia hosted an interfaith conference in madrid spain during the conference that took place from july 16 19 king abdullah of saudi arabia called for reconciliation among various religions
1561411 the mere fact that rabbis would be openly invited to the kingdom a country where in principle jews are not permitted to visit would have constituted a turning point
1561412 people are being more discerning not going out as often but making it count when they do they want to go to places they know will look after them and that they can trust
1561413 we are still doing well around north cheshire but our liverpool and newcastle restaurants are performing even better

1561417 jesus turned the water into wine so it must be o k without all the facts you might believe god does think wine is o k it does sound convincing
1561418 beverages that contain caffeine or alcohol are diuretics causing the body to lose more water than they supply and thus should not be counted on at all to satisfy the recommended intake of six to eight glasses of water a day

1561423 although we normally have a physician here on fridays today we dont
1561424 for benefits and eligibility information contact continental general insurance company at another toll free number that well call number 2
1561425 my card says central reserve life and healthlink its healthlink insurance but its through central reserve life
1561426 we dont show any policy for central reserve life do you have world insurance
1561427 i dont think so i have healthlink through central reserve life
1561428 we show healthlink through world insurance but nothing through central reserve life to get your question answered youd need to call this benefits number
1561429 i apologize for the inconvenience but i just dont show anything for central reserve life
1561430 i cant tell you about your benefits but i have the number you need to call
1561431 is this really america this sounds like health care in a communist country
1561432 why bother staying with her its a waste of time looking after them it doesnt do any good in the end and it just destroys your own life eventually so why bother
1561433 no problem sir our first available appointment for an engineer is for tomorrow would that be suitable
1561434 it came to me that this woman loves and worships the same god i do
1561435 i had this sharpened awareness that in that moment she was in touch with god just as i was it was a dawning and an awakening and it was liberating because it liberates you from standing on a pedestal and looking down on someone else
1561436 beyond 9 11 christians and muslims together a new world vision
1561437 is that we can find a way to bridge the chasm between christians muslims jews hindus and buddhists and make atlanta a model city that over the next year or two we can develop an interfaith immersion program
1561438 a soft evangelical i ask questions and listen rather than telling people what they ought to do or believe
1561439 im the most unlikely candidate for becoming a spokesperson about islam
1561440 i wondered who i was now that i wasnt a teacher preacher traveler or speaker
1561441 you get beneath the dogma and creeds to the essence of what religion is about its about god in human beings in human consciousness
1561442 a voice in my head said and you dont know anything about islam which was true i have five degrees four of them theological and other religions had never been taught seriously to me
1561443 everything about my faith is rooted in the stories my two grandmothers told me
1561444 no one formally taught me to pray as a child i had the question what is god like my grandmother answered that is like a drop in the ocean trying to understand what the ocean is like this is something i feel with my heart god is present in everything god is all around us
1561445 there were a couple of imams muslim clerics and im thinking they know all this stuff and im stumbling around in it
1561446 we had a pastor and an imam describe how they came to the faith that gives their lives meaning
1561447 and we asked people to talk at their tables about how their faith came to them
1561448 i dont think just knowledge about another faith is any good
1561449 youve gotta meet someone who is of the faith who is speaking out of conviction and out of experience to really feel what islam is like
1561450 puts muslims at ease because hes mastered the broad historical perspective of islam but also some of the nuanced details
1561451 people are more open to learning a new perspective from someone they respect ben is not trying to convert anyone but to inform people and build understanding
1561452 when i heard him talk about islam i thought we need him
1561453 many christians are fearful of islam so they put up barriers they trust ben so they are willing to take the first step and listen for understanding
1561454 if you sit in silence you can get deep enough into your faith that it touches another person
1561455 the reality is that at the core were all the same
1561456 in my 76th year i would be passionate about getting christians jews muslims and hindus together nothing in my history would point me in this direction this is not my dream i think its the spirit of god
1561457 as a headline my friend keith who works at nc soft the makers of
1561458 i know you dont do portfolio reviews but id love for you to just take a quick look at my work it would mean the world to me
1561459 okay so last thursday night i was riding with friends on the lakefront it was hard to pedal but i thought that i was just tired then we were crossing the 31st street bridge when i heard this weird noise i stopped and realized that my rear brake was engaged after about five minutes we realized that i had pinched the brake cable with my front rack i know rookie error the next morning i was riding to work and the first through third gears wouldnt engage properly after work i played with the cable near the shifter on the ride home fifth gear didnt work so i brought hank in doug worked on him he fixed my brake cable issue and adjusted the hub whats weird now is that the fourth gear slips sometimes fifth too
1561460 i doubt it i mean this is the newest hub from shimano its supposed to be really good can you leave it
1561461 yeah i just want it fixed i mean i would rather you take your time gd i hope that i didnt amp up the hub
1561462 thats highly unlikely but well get in there and take a look at it
1561463 no i dont think so i will try to get it back to you by the end of the weekend
1561464 sidewalks in the kingdom new urbanism and the christian faith
1561465 could there be a connection then between the eternal city as the form of our redeemed existence and the temporal city as the crucible in which character is formed for that eternal existence certainly we see this negatively in peoples decisions to reject the city cities force us to live work and play near people to whom we may need to show love gentleness and kindness in the suburbian idal of a large home surrounded by a large lot we dont ever have to see others let alone interact with them cities are filled with physical historical and relational contingencies that require patience and self control on our part the suburban trend is to inflict standardized houses and standardized stores on an area irrespective of regional history or local ethos in order to maximize efficiency of the builder and the spending power of the consumer of course cities do not guarantee the development of fruits of the spirit in fact the opposite is what we tend to expect cities stereotypically are known as impersonal cold and hostile environments while some of these impressions are well deserved and accurate many of them are false generalizations based on anecdotal evidence after all you are more likely to be greeted by name at the corner coffee shop on your block in new york city than you would be by the teenage employee at the starbucks at the strip mall that is two miles from your housing subdivision nevertheless the point is that the conditions of city life create opportunities for the fruits of the spirit to grow if one is in fact being directed by the holy spirit
1561466 no amp ing way finally i am so giving you a virtual hug right now
1561467 nothing yet but maybe a friend on the way home
1561468 why dont i give you a ride to her place
1561469 do you want to take it out for a spin
1561470 greetings a nonymous back to update you on my journey to dutchness advance apologies for the length of this post
1561471 but your praise of the j amp o and real dutch bikes made me decide to at least test ride the scout
1561472 so on a sunny day last week i showed up at her place for a test ride and was hooked the bike about a year old was in great shape except for one easily fixed little problem the spring that keeps the front wheel from wobbling had come loose a trip to the atm and she was mine
1561473 shes a heavy beauty no doubt but after toting that battery even the oma seemed light on the return voyage we handled the moderate climb back up from the river just fine and i will have to test her to find our limit for steeper portland hills
1561474 so far i absolutely love the ride even as it takes some adjustment to the different posture and feeling
1561475 i especially appreciate being able to easily ride slowly yet stably so i can accompany my sweetie alongside her motorized wheelchair scooter as i did in holland but i was also able to cruise as fast as i wanted on flat downhill and even moderate uphills
1561476 i also liked not having to think about clipping lights on or replacing batteries and being able to use just the wheel lock while we were sitting at the brewpubs outside table talking bikes munching dinner and sipping microbrews as bike after bike rolled by in the warm portland summer evening
1561477 i need to do a lot more riding of course to know how i really feel about her and to get a new pannier my current one doesnt fit the wider rear rack and bungee cords whose hooks dont scratch the paint off
1561478 thanks so much alex for your thorough advice if i had not read your post im sure i would not have kept looking and im so glad i did im also enjoying reading your hank diary thanks again to everyone for the help im looking forward to my next ride tomorrow
1561479 its always something if its not one thing its another

1561494 we have notified the family of margaret and seana tapp and a senior member from victoria police has explained the problems with the process that took place
1561495 the corridor i have announced today is generally in line with the preferred alignment put forward by melbourne water and recommended by the independent advisory committee
1561496 the advisory committee report concluded the preferred route would be consistent with state policies on environmental protection
1561497 were finding that these sorts of market conditions can have a significant impact on a persons job security which in turn drives them to seek out employment with great long term stability
1561498 were also hearing about jobseekers looking for work closer to home to counteract rising petrol prices

1561502 on being told the free government quota of alcohol had been reached mr kiely became upset and proceeded to sexually harass me and undermine my security position in a very loud and obnoxious way
1561503 im confident that len will continue to be a good local member for the people of sanderson
1561504 overall finance approvals are now down a quarter since its peak earlier in the year
1561505 this obviously has been a key part of the reserve bank thinking
1561506 they would have had this data on hand with their decision yesterday
1561507 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1561508 falls in approvals are on a par with previous cycles
1561509 but it is much more concentrated in purchase for established dwellings
1561510 to have a 25 per cent fall in finance approvals in five months would have them a little bit worried
1561511 the deceleration is much more abrupt than they would like
1561512 as a leading indicator of building approvals and commencements the series suggest further weakness with housing likely to detract from activity in 2008 and into 2009
1561513 the construction sector is one of the largest employers accounting for around 10 per cent of total employment with the related property amp business services accounting for 12 per cent of total employment

1561706 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1561707 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive

1561725 a lot of these tenants are suddenly getting an eviction and then the tenants the one losing his house with his family and his kids and his school district and paying his rent on time

1561728 its technically not gone but you have to get it back from your landlord
1561729 given the fact that they got foreclosed good luck getting your security deposit back from them

1561738 aguirre is addressing a real issue that is out there
1561739 it has the possibility to establish a new baseline for dealing with the foreclosure crisis
1561740 if you have thousands and thousands of loans that were unlawfully originated do you allow the people who unlawfully originated them to use foreclosure to consummate the transaction
1561741 there has to be something some legal claim to direct people into the government backed refis
1561742 whats the difference if you borrow money from the credit card company mom or the mortgage lender there is an expectation in our society that you pay it back
1561743 a lot of people understood the terms and conditions but took on the loans in anticipation of large income gains
1561744 there were people who misrepresented assets to get these loans
1561745 i have seen these people in court and i have not allowed them to skate on that
1561746 if the house next door to my house is on fire then i have to put the fire out so my house doesnt catch fire

1561759 well its a grown up word and little girls shouldnt say grown up words
1561760 you almost got me in trouble you didnt tell me shit was a bad word
1561761 everybody knows shit is a bad word if you want to say it in front of grown ups you have to say it op
1561762 op its like a code you spell the word instead of saying it but you dont say the consonants you make their sound and add op afterwards

1561767 mr marshall has not been convicted nor charged with a crime
1561768 its not enough to simply avoid being found guilty of a crime instead as an employee of the nfl or a member club you are held to a higher standard persons who fail to live up to this standard are guilty of conduct detrimental and subject to discipline even where the conduct itself does not result in conviction of a crime
1561769 i get to appeal to the guy who imposed the discipline
1561770 i am assuming the nfl will send out another press release to tell us
1561771 i told him we would appeal it and hes anxious to have some modicum of due process
1561772 he doesnt deserve any of that because he is not a bad guy

1561780 mundane subjects or those that try a teachers patience would be good for robot teachers
1561781 computers are already powerful enough to sustain useful robots that interact and assist humans in everyday life
1561782 now progress requires a scientific shakedown in goals and methods not unlike the cognitive revolution that occurred 40 years ago
1561783 so in later research when the computer recognizes that a student is perceiving a lecture to be really hard or perceives that the user wants the robot to slow down it will accommodate
1561784 if im a student with a robot teacher and i can say yeah speed up come on i understand you or hey im losing you slow down a second then thats really good really helpful
1561785 if im completely puzzled and yet the robot keeps giving me more information thats not going to be very useful
1561786 its not going to revolutionize the world but its promising

1561800 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature
1561801 considering the gravity of the alleged facts the rwandan government asks competent authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice
1561802 if you go to the report you will see for yourself how communication was done from the top leadership in paris to the embassy in kigali and how different people who had a role in the genocide were housed at the embassy residence
1561803 the role played by france in the aftermath to protect the genocidal forces and make it very difficult for them to be apprehended and brought to justice
1561804 this should be clear that this report will not go lie down put in store somewhere this report will be used it will help in bringing to justice making very serious attempts to bring to justice people who were involved in committing genocide in this country
1561805 france assumes full responsibility for its actions in rwanda in 1994 especially those of its armed forces
1561806 this report now that its out it shows all of the individuals in the france government that were involved in the genocide

1561815 we believe and confess the canonical scriptures of the holy prophets and apostles of both testaments to be the true and genuine word of god and to have sufficient authority of themselves not of men for god himself spoke to the fathers prophets apostles and still speaks to us through the holy scriptures
1561816 i am so hostile to second maccabees and to esther that i would wish they did not exist at all for they judaize too greatly and have much pagan rubbish
1561817 do not think that in the kings palace you will escape any more than all the other jews for if you keep silence at such a time as this relief and deliverance will rise for the jews from another quarter but you and your fathers family will perish who knows perhaps you have come to royal dignity for just such a time as this
1561818 when they the church fathers interpret a passage in scripture they do not do so with their own sense or words for whenever they do that as often happens they generally err instead they add another passage which is clearer and thus illumine and interpret scripture with scripture
1561819 i am the god of your father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob i have observed the misery of my people who are in egypt i have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters indeed i know their sufferings and i have come down to deliver them from the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land a land flowing with milk and honey to the country of the canaanites the hittites the amorites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites

1561833 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1561834 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1561835 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1561836 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1561837 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1561838 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way

1561855 hear my prayer o god give ear to the words of my mouth
1561856 when you are praying do not heap up 128 empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words do not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him
1561857 your father knows what you need before you ask him
1561858 why should prayers be included in gods plan as the causes of certain effects and what sense is there in the notion that god who disposes and plans everything with omnipotence and perfect goodness brings about some things because of human prayers
1561859 the power and wisdom of god rather than the motivation or purpose that inspired god to act
1561860 if i call god providence i refer only to his goodness
1561861 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us in christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places
1561862 before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love

1561867 i am the light of the world whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life
1561868 my grace is sufficient for you for power is made perfect in weakness
1561869 i am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecutions and calamities for the sake of christ for whenever i am weak then i am strong
1561870 while we live we are always being given up to death for jesus sake so that the life of jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh
1561871 rom 14 8 our own prayer requests are no longer a question of life and death
1561872 when you are praying do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard because of their many words
1561873 clearly distinguish between vain babbling and praying for something definite
1561874 prayer without kavvanah is like a body without a soul
1561875 we have to pray now because we are supposed to do so at this moment
1561876 prayers have as a primary function the effort to persuade and motivate god to act in behalf of the petitioner who is in trouble and needs gods help
1561877 have regard for 141 this vine the stock that your right hand planted

1561880 we pray this in the name of jesus christ your son who with you and the holy spirit lives in our midst now and for ever
1561881 what an idle pair of slobs they will be thinking self righteously

1561883 it is not only umno members who want a fair election but also malaysians and especially the malay community want the same thing
1561884 i can only say that my report is against the powers that be who are the most powerful people in this country
1561885 it is not only umno members who want a fair election but also malaysians
1561886 from our investigations the employer didnt breach any labour laws
1561887 it has been a policy in this country for quite a number of employers to keep the passports for safety reasons
1561888 we view this seriously unless and until we maintain an appearance that we are a conducive place to do such business our conditions of work and employment are meeting up to international standards then we might lose out in the long run
1561889 the government will do everything to ensure that we are internationally competitive
1561890 the question before us is who is appearing in the appeal is it the chinese name or the muslim name
1561891 there is no dispute as to the identity of the appellant there is no confusion because the appellant is the same person as the name stated in the appeal application
1561892 the right authority to determine her legal entity is the nrd based on her ic therefore the appellant must get approval from the nrd to change the muslim name to her chinese name which was rejected by the nrd
1561893 meanwhile outside the court bon had asked the media not to divulge the name of the woman for safety reasons

1561977 las oficinas de informaci n y turismo y en los hoteles
1561978 la recaudaci n media de un d a cualquiera este mes seg n est n las tarifas es menos de la mitad de la que hac amos el a o pasado
1561979 el pasado 16 de julio se abri el turno libre lo que supone que todos los taxis pueden circular por las calles sin un horario establecido con el nico requisito de librar un d a por semana
1561980 hay mucho menos trabajo que a os anteriores pasamos los ratos muertos en las paradas cosa que otros a os no pasaba
1561981 las paradas est n llenas de taxis hay muy pocos clientes y hay veces en las que los coches est n estacionados incluso en doble fila porque no caben todos los taxis en la parada
1561982 tradicionalmente se ha entendido al taxi como una herramientas de lujo para evitar los transportes p blicos pero la econom a ha hecho que los clientes prefieran los autobuses para desplazarse
1561983 nunca cre que en benidorm llegar amos a esta situaci n llevo 39 a os trabajando y siempre cada verano ha sido muy beneficioso con mucho trabajo
1561984 un solo taxista que no tenga asalariados lo tiene muy dif cil econ micamente ya que tiene que estar todo el d a en la calle para poder hacer frente a todos los gastos hay taxis que los llevan entre varios miembros de una familia porque cada vez est m s complicado

1561990 pero no lo est cumpliendo y nos sentimos abandonados sobre todo desde mediados de julio que se han sucedido estos problemas de horarios
1561991 y prive de este espacio a personas mayores y ni os que necesitan especialmente tomar el fresco
1561992 lo normal es que fuera el servicio nocturno el encargado del cierre en el horario de verano y a las 0 30 pero puede que al haber poca gente operativa se produzca alg n problema de este tipo
1561993 por lo general se presta m s atenci n en no cometer infracciones graves pero se descuidan en otras cosas que se consideran m s leves pero que igualmente son motivo de sanci n
1561994 el volumen de trabajo para esta secci n es inasumible por la falta de personal y de recursos

1561996 se ha hecho el proyecto de una forma muy pr ctica y agradable para que la gente venga a comprar un espacio muy abierto y muy c modo
1561997 estamos en un mundo que cambian muchas las cosas pero no hay que perder de vista la forma de vida tradicional como es el mercado y hay que intentar preservarlo para las generaciones futuras
1561998 el mercado tiene otra cara totalmente distinta a la que ten a hemos ganado mucho en salubridad en amplitud y en luminosidad
1561999 generen alternativas nuevas de servicios como abrir durante m s tiempo ampliar el horario ofrecer al cliente la compra a domicilio o un servicio de demanda por internet tienen que crear una marca la mistera para que puedan competir con las grandes superficies

1562149 without even realizing it the gop drilling offensive has become a new contract with america
1562150 new economic statistics highlight the damage done by the unprecedented oil price shock only a year ago real gross domestic product was growing at 4 to 5 percent then came the dramatic rise of energy prices and down came the economy
1562151 what we learned about running death squads and propping up corrupt government in latin america and how to apply it to other places
1562152 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor and sign onto the american energy act our all of the above plan to increase conservation innovation and american energy production instead of doing the speakers bidding by voting against bringing it to a vote if you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one youre siding with the speaker of the drill nothing congress and radical special interests that favor higher gas prices at the expense of energy strapped american families
1562153 this cynical strategy is disgustingly dishonest without any real solutions to help americans who are struggling with record high gas prices it appears the democratic leadership has hit on a new plan deceive deceive the press deceive its members and deceive the american people democratic members have a pass from their leaders to talk about drilling at home while the liberal democratic leadership which is beholden to special interests that want higher gas prices plays rope a dope back in washington ensuring there is no vote to help the american people before november its cynical dishonest and wrong and it wont work
1562154 if you wont vote for us we wont vote for you
1562155 forget about whats good information for americans lets stick to whats good for democrats
1562156 oh my gosh a nation of imbeciles who cant even keep their tires inflated properly

1562158 portanto cuidado na escolha dos alimentos fuja dos industrializados evite excesso com gordura animal principalmente carne de porco e mesmo carne de vaca com gordura substitua as frituras pelo cozimento ou assados e coma uma maior quantidade de verduras legumes e frutas para uma vida mais saud vel
1562159 a uve te uma inflama o que se manifesta em toda a vea ou em uma de suas partes do ponto de vista anat mico a vea dividida em duas por es a anterior que engloba a ris e o corpo ciliar e a posterior constitu da pela cor ide que est intimamente ligada retina por isso os processos inflamat rios que atingem a cor ide ou a retina se misturam muitas altera es que comprometem inicialmente a cor ide passam a comprometer a retina e vice versa
1562160 os pacientes se queixam da presen a de uma mancha escura ou de turva o visual isso acontece sobretudo quando existe comprometimento da cor ide e da retina porque muitas c lulas passam para o humor v treo que perde a transpar ncia e a nuvem que se forma na frente da retina perturba a nitidez da vis o
1562161 o diagn stico diferencial tamb m importante porque existe a s ndrome mascarada com caracter sticas que simulam a uve te mas que s o manifesta es de doen as sist micas de met stases ou de alguns linfomas na cor ide e na retina
1562162 todos os pacientes com alguma manifesta o reum tica devem fazer um exame de sangue chamado fan fatorantin cleo pois 70 dos que t m fan positivo desenvolver o mais tarde um quadro de uve te a vantagem do diagn stico precoce tanto da uve te anterior quanto da posterior poder atuar preventivamente uma vez que o grande foco da terap utica preservar a anatomia do bulbo ocular e proporcionar conforto ao paciente
1562163 por isso quando o olho vermelho sintoma de uve te anterior a primeira medida terap utica dilatar a pupila para evitar ader ncias e preservar a anatomia do olho
1562164 geralmente nas crian as o quadro n o agudo cr nico e elas n o reclamam muito porque v o se acostumando com os sintomas s o os pais que notam o olho vermelho com os adultos diferente uma vez que dor sensibilidade luz e hiperemia s o sintomas marcantes da uve te anterior

1562168 last week was the final week of the july session before the traditional august recess
1562169 were the most important issues facing the nation and should be worked on before anything else in the senate
1562170 the bottom line is that the legislation never got a substantiative vote
1562171 unless the drilling legislation goes first it is likely that republicans will continue to hammer away on the issue and prevent future votes
1562172 that said political pressure is causing a lot of democrats to cave on their position on the drilling legislation and its likely that some form of that legislation will pass before any other meaningful legislation in september if that happens or if republicans lessen their tactics the shield law could be brought to the floor and would likely get more than the needed 60 votes to proceed
1562173 the good news though is that presumptive presidential nominees barack obama have endorsed the legislation maybe it will get pushed back until january but hopefully by then it will draw more support
1562174 what ive discovered in my research is and the department of veterans affairs has now acknowledged it there is a correlation between trauma suffered by vets and subsequent behavioural issues from their kids
1562175 they see their parents flipping out and losing it they see breakdown in marriages they somehow take an assumed guilt position and start to feel vulnerable about the whole issue
1562176 i believe this has impacted on this young lady and i think its probably indicative of what may happen to other veterans kids too
1562177 her dad was an icon in the 60s who was dethroned because he went to vietnam he paid the penalty for it
1562178 he has since become a high profile spokesperson for vietnam vets and she lives with that day to day
1562179 the grand carousel has operated at the ekka without a problem for more than 50 years
1562180 its been a favourite with children and their families for generations but now its deemed by some departmental inspector to be too dangerous to operate even though it has never had a safety issue
1562181 we did not prohibit that ride from coming to the show
1562182 we have said we would require him to fix or minimise the hazard
1562183 one child hurt is one too many and todays rides no matter how old have to meet todays safety standards
1562184 with only one toy being apprehended this year it does demonstrate that industry is far more conscious of those responsibilities and are complying with safety standards
1562185 it did seem a bit strange to me but i just have this rule that no one goes near another vessel

1562205 based on changing business conditions and allowing for one off project costs of 6 5 million we are on track to achieve earnings for 2008 broadly consistent with analysts consensus forecasts he said
1562206 this is a range of 61 7 million to 66 1 million for our fiscal 2008 net profit after tax after allowing for one off costs
1562207 to that end negotiations with potential acquisition targets continue he said
1562208 i am pleased to report that the consolidation of our sydney warehouses to a single purpose built facility at erskine park is on track mr harrod said

1562212 priceline com turned in an excellent quarter with consolidated gross travel bookings growth of 71 despite macroeconomic uncertainties and softening travel market trends
1562213 our international business which includes booking com and agoda com had 1 2 billion in 2
1562214 priceline s domestic business also posted a strong quarter with gross travel bookings up 59 2 over last year our discounted domestic merchant services grew 36 as consumers sought out travel deals and airlines and hotel companies used our
1562215 economic uncertainty and high fuel prices are affecting the broad travel market and significant airline capacity reductions in the fall will also have a negative impact

1562219 in our view this was the best result for the shareholders
1562220 its difficult to exactly identify the culprit for the companys financial situation
1562221 the macro economic conditions are most of it with high gas prices and declines in home values which makes it a really difficult time for casual dining restaurants
1562222 if they are using casual dining they are spending less and coming less often some are trading down to quick service restaurants mcdonalds is still doing well
1562223 significant capital was spent on the internal investigation then bringing in a new corporate governance structure and complying with sarbanes oxley regulations
1562224 it was a financial drain and a distraction for management

1562236 our projections show the most likely outcome of yesterdays elections will be that hillary clinton gained 187 delegates and we gained 183
1562237 the task for the clinton campaign yesterday was clear in order to have a plausible path to the nomination they needed to score huge delegate victories and cut into our lead they failed

1562244 to go the extra mile is just to do more than the customer expects of you
1562245 investors were not keen on sharing profits when the market was soaring profit sharing then created a negative impression in the minds of investors but with the market now on a downtrend investors are coming into terms with the new fee concept
1562246 your mother brings you food every day you eat it at the canteen
1562247 remains cautious in its outlook for advertising revenue given the low levels of business and consumer confidence
1562248 clearly there is not enough positive news to get the market excited about the stock
1562249 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1562250 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president

1562254 nevertheless we would expect profit growth for 2008 09 to exceed 12 per cent
1562255 its the strongest showing weve had since god knows how long
1562256 the market got excited because the us federal reserve said it would hold rates where they are which is a good thing
1562257 and now of course the reserve bank here has alluded to a cut at some stage in the future
1562258 clients have been battered and are still shaking their heads a little bit dazed and hoping there are better days around the corner
1562259 if we had some sunny days ahead of us then i think they will start to pay attention again
1562260 unfortunately the gold price kept getting away from us and it took a little bit of time to work out the right execution strategy because many companies that have gone in on their hedge books have actually bought physical gold so the market moves away from you
1562261 we had these contracts already in place and just delivered into the existing contracts but brought the contracts forward so we didnt get caught with a rising gold price
1562262 africa remains a key but colombia will be a big part of our growth story
1562263 were looking to increase production out of brazil by 50 per cent over the next five years
1562264 wed like to grow our production base here to in excess of a million ounces
1562265 but at the end of the day growing the business here is a lot tougher than other parts of the world
1562266 so for us to try and drive well beyond one million ounces well have to look at our whole policy framework and access to ground
1562267 the strong growth in profits reflects both the buoyancy of the western australian economy and the major internal improvements made by the company in the past year
1562268 things have to get worse for the aussie to continue selling off
1562269 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1562270 it would take very strong fundamental support for the australian dollar to regain recent highs and those fundamental supports are pulling back more quickly than we had anticipated
1562271 we were thrilled to be able to give a amp e s audience a voyeur view including a behind the scenes look at what was happening during the whole event from pre show to post event coverage

1562337 i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter maguire said in the same statement
1562338 suskind said he stands by his account which he said was based on many hours of interviews in which sources laid out the story bit by bit many of the interviews were taped he said suskind added that he understood the enormous pressure that can be brought to bear on sources who formerly worked for the government and still have professional ties

1562343 when the news media found out he was in cavendish they just descended on the town to find out everything they could people wouldnt tell them anything
1562344 our children grew up and went to school here alongside your children
1562345 indeed our whole family has felt at home among you exile is always difficult and yet i could not imagine a better place to live and wait and wait for my return home than cavendish vermont
1562346 he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills
1562347 indeed when i come to the children of israel and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they say to me what is his name what shall i say to them
1562348 thus you shall say to the children of israel i am has sent me to you

1562350 at this rate im gonna start liking jews soon enough
1562351 i talked to their controller hes a typical jew but a nice guy
1562352 blah blah blah i can only send my kids to a private school
1562353 whaddaya mean why dont you know that public schools are full of blacks your boys are in a public school you should know that didnt you look at that when picking the school in every public school i checked out i saw them theres this school thats supposed to be good good ratings everything i come in for a visit and there they are walking down the hallways didnt you ever check for it
1562354 i didnt look at that i looked at the test results
1562355 dont you know theyre going to grow older and shoot our children
1562356 ill give it my best and theres nothing more that you can do
1562357 was located in one of the rooms trying to hide forty six 100 dollar bills down the front of her blouse
1562358 to pay 100 to 1 000 for each receipt found to have included too many credit card numbers for thousands of customers
1562359 it wasnt i honestly think i enjoyed iron man more
1562360 it had the different characters that are on the olympic website
1562361 it had every sporting event possible every time a timetable a map everything it looked totally legitimate
1562362 our suppliers have not been able to honour their commitments to us in supplying tickets for the summer olympics despite having received written assurances from these suppliers we are given to understand that they have placed themselves in to bankruptcy despite having been paid in full by our company
1562363 my initial reaction was fear anger i said lots of very ugly words
1562364 if you want to rent it now you will have to drop the asking rental

1562369 im the type of person that if they see fit that brad green can be captain of the melbourne football club then ill try and do it to the best of my ability and if that goes through the board and the players and everyones happy with that then its certainly something to consider
1562370 im not putting my hand up to say that i want to be captain but if everything falls into place and the right people think im the beset man for the job certainly then ill put my hand up and do it
1562371 the kid was confused but hes very relieved and well see how he comes through this ordeal
1562372 its another part of footy its a learning curve for him but he was very confused and bewildered by it because he thought hed done nothing wrong it was a great result
1562373 an inspiring collection of lessons illustrated quotes and proverbs found on stumbleupon
1562374 this is yet another worrying set of statistics confirming that the financial crisis continues to deepen
1562375 particularly concerning is the construction sector which usually shows a strong requirement for temporary labour
1562376 this is a clear indication that the credit crunch has started to reach the jobs market
1562377 business confidence is low and as a result employers are becoming much more cautious
1562378 do you think i could fight an army with those trucks

1562380 we are too many years behind other countries we need the coalition forces until 2015
1562381 wir haben uns f r ihn entschieden weil er wie kaum wie ein anderer die olympische idee verk rpert
1562382 ein weltstar demonstriert dass es ein h hepunkt seiner sportlichen karriere ist mit athleten aus aller welt und vielen sportarten gemeinsam sport zu treiben
1562383 das ist eine klare aussage und somit ein tolles vorbild f r junge sportler
1562384 theres none of our goods there i am sure of it we have arrangements in place in the netherlands
1562385 production has not reached the critical stage the company is very reasonable thanks to my achievements in the past so although i do get pressurised thats not happened yet on the current project and thats something i feel gratitude for that the company gives us the opportunity to focus by giving us time
1562386 we wanted to know when our american friends would get interested in tracking down the terrorists responsible for hundreds of suicide bombings in pakistan and those playing havoc with our natural resources in baluchistan
1562387 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
1562388 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1562389 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1562390 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1562391 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
1562392 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
1562393 over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
1562394 the one thing that i was looking for out of that conversation was was he ready committed to play football for the green bay packers
1562395 and his answer frankly throughout the conversation his mindset based on things that had happened throughout this whole course that thats not where he was
1562396 mike are you saying that his mindset is not right for playing football here in green bay or playing football period
1562397 i would just say here in green bay he wants to play
1562398 the train has left the station he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past all the things that happened i have to keep the train moving and he respects that
1562399 youre of the opinion that the bon homme school district is not adequately funded is that a fair statement
1562400 by their own admission and looking at their paperwork yes
1562401 is it fair to say that you believe our current k 12 system is underfunded yes or no
1562402 it seems like this whole summers gone by like that
1562403 i fly into san jose and we will process and get all our olympic gear and uniforms and things of that nature
1562404 and then we will fly out on the 6th and head to china straight from there
1562405 i think it was one of those things where i think if you looked at the big picture it could kind of get a little bit overpowering maybe
1562406 i think this year having had the surgery you have all those kinds of questions of can i come back and be as strong a competitor as i was in 04 and can i run as fast as i need to to be able to jump as high as some of the younger guys are
1562407 and after ive done that i think ill stop and assess ok where does that place me on the scoring and things of that nature and then from that point on what do i need to do to make sure i get a medal
1562408 i think this time there will be a lot more focus i think 2004 was probably a little bit more having the experience that i want to take everything in
1562409 ive kind of set some goals and ive achieved those goals and now im setting new goals and im going to work towards those and i think thats kind of a great lesson in life once you kind of continue to get where you want to be then you reassess and you have some new goals and you keep on trucking and i think thatll work til the day you die
1562410 pressures for higher rates are likely to linger on the committee
1562411 overall we cannot entirely rule out the risk that the committee will sanction higher rates this time
1562412 centricas 35 percent increase in domestic tariffs suggests that inflation will hit 5 0 percent
1562413 inflationary pressures continue to prevent the mpc from cutting rates in response to the deteriorating real economy
1562414 in fact if interest rates change this month they are more likely to go up than down
1562415 we suspect that most mpc members are still firmly in wait and see mode and in no hurry to move interest rates given the current major uncertainties surrounding both the medium term inflation and growth outlooks
1562416 there are still many issues we have to deal with were not saved
1562417 hes one of those guys who can just go about his daily business nothing seems to fluster him or he doesnt get uptight about anything
1562418 hes the kind of guy that the players can be arguing about something for five or 10 minutes in team meetings and suddenly harvs will say something and the room will go quiet and listen to what he has to say so hes got that kind of respect around the place
1562419 overall finance approvals are now down a quarter since its peak earlier in the year
1562420 this obviously has been a key part of the reserve bank thinking
1562421 they would have had this data on hand with their decision yesterday
1562422 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1562423 falls in approvals are on a par with previous cycles
1562424 but it is much more concentrated in purchase for established dwellings
1562425 to have a 25 per cent fall in finance approvals in five months would have them a little bit worried
1562426 the deceleration is much more abrupt than they would like
1562427 as a leading indicator of building approvals and commencements the series suggest further weakness with housing likely to detract from activity in 2008 and into 2009
1562428 the construction sector is one of the largest employers accounting for around 10 per cent of total employment with the related property amp business services accounting for 12 per cent of total employment
1562429 todays data are supportive of the rbas newly adopted easing bias
1562430 this decision is consistent with our intent to move to an integrated technology platform and create a truly services focused organisation
1562431 im a gamer and the chance to act in one of the best loved games was an opportunity i was really keen to explore
1562432 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature
1562433 considering the gravity of the alleged facts the rwandan government asks competent authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice
1562434 if you go to the report you will see for yourself how communication was done from the top leadership in paris to the embassy in kigali and how different people who had a role in the genocide were housed at the embassy residence
1562435 the role played by france in the aftermath to protect the genocidal forces and make it very difficult for them to be apprehended and brought to justice
1562436 this should be clear that this report will not go lie down put in store somewhere this report will be used it will help in bringing to justice making very serious attempts to bring to justice people who were involved in committing genocide in this country
1562437 this report now that its out it shows all of the individuals in the france government that were involved in the genocide
1562438 were not on an oct 1 or a nov 1 or even a dec 1 deadline
1562439 what were proposing is not to shutter the main library until we have a satellite facility up and ready to go once we do that then we would take the main library down
1562440 do we buy a new building in east village do we build a new building
1562441 were contemplating a civic center remodel seismic retrofit in the next two to three years
1562442 i appreciate the fact that the city budget needs to be balanced but it should not be done at the expense of citizens in the downtown district
1562443 main library has been the brain for all our 12 city libraries if main is to be shuttered money and means must already be in the pipeline to build this necessary component
1562444 im absolutely opposed to a complete decimation of the main library without working with the people who are library users and library supporters i dont believe that expanding the library hours at other branches would ever take the place of the services and core services at the main library
1562445 but i also understand that we have to address a severe financial problem
1562446 unless its a really good satellite facility it will pale in comparison to what we have now
1562447 what would the funding source be for the library should our proposed 571 million infrastructure bond not go forth
1562448 right now the redevelopment agency would be there with several million dollars perhaps 8 million
1562449 thats something wed have to do is sit down and see what we can minimally do to make that facility safe
1562450 im hoping as is our mayor bob foster and every person on the city council that the infrastructure bond will pass
1562451 if it doesnt whats the alternative for main library will it be closed indefinitely or perhaps permanently
1562452 we all know that sooner or later were going to do something with civic center here when we focus on city hall to upgrade it seismically we could also focus on the library
1562453 theres a rumor going around that theres a plan to package this land and the city hall land and sell them off together
1562454 the librarys disrepair has been know by this council and this city for decades this is not something that comes upon us as new i just really want us to take this slowly when we talk about closing a major important facility
1562455 i want to dispel two rumors first that there is any plan afoot to sell city hall land
1562456 if theres things in this budget you want to restore thats within your purview

1562459 i have to admit that sometimes i think i wish i could be reborn because of all the opportunities that are there but it makes me happy that kids today have them and i feel so lucky in terms of what i got to experience and the people like loretta who did what they did for us what i do feel bad about is the women my age who werent as lucky

1562493 you do see the odd bit of whiteness here and there mainly in butterflies but the whiteness is really incomparable with this little beetle
1562494 and when i put them under the electron microscope it was like another world had opened up it was totally remarkable
1562495 the degree of whiteness given the scales thinness is the really impressive thing
1562496 we can create this quality of white synthetically but the materials need to be much thicker this could have many applications
1562497 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1562498 we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
1562499 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1562500 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1562501 the report shows iraqs budget surplus is likely to grow significantly over the course of 2008 but it is equally important to realize that spending in iraq is also increasing
1562502 were dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
1562503 is going to make a lot of american families very angry
1562504 the record gas prices they are paying have turned into an economic windfall for iraq but the iraqi government isnt spending the money on rebuilding

1562507 the main difference is that when you run it in in house you can get a wider range of information out because you have much greater resources to store and transfer data
1562508 its mainly been done as an educational tool although the output is useful
1562509 these figures basically support the scientific consensus at the moment
1562510 what makes it especially interesting is that we have included changes to the suns output based on what it has done over the last century and we find it doesnt make much difference
1562511 the idea that such changes could influence climate over and above the human influence we dont find very likely

1562515 for raven brought light to the world placing the sun moon and stars in the sky
1562516 ravens crows used to be blamed for killing lambs because they were often seen feeding on them but its now believed ravens only feed on lambs which are dead or dying from something else in some ways ravens help farmers because theyll eat grasshoppers and other pest insects australian ravens crows hang around in flocks until theyre old enough to pair off to breed and then they stay with the same partner for the rest of their life

1562530 modern politics is a chapter in the history of religion the greatest of the revolutionary upheavals that have shaped so much of the history of the past two centuries were episodes in the history of faith moments in the long dissolution of christianity and the rise of modern political religion
1562531 at a time when islamist terrorism seems to have returned to the centre of london it is easy to forget that during the 20th century terror was used on a vast scale by secular regimes today suicide attacks are automatically linked with a belief in martyrdom followed by paradise in the afterlife yet suicide bombing of the kind we now confront is a terrorist technique that was developed by people with no such beliefs the roots of contemporary terrorism are in radical western ideology especially leninism far more than in religion
1562532 and i knew it was there and i knew that there are some things you have to fight for and that you cant insist that everything be to some ideal construction you have made

1562789 now thats not a reason to vote for dan carne but thats something to think about thats a reality facing the board
1562790 imbed accountability both in the educational and financial side of the school district
1562791 especially ones that have touched the lives of children everyday for 30 years
1562792 people working with children they know whats going on in the school district
1562793 so they can bring unique knowledge to the school board
1562794 i think were going to have enough board member experience on their already
1562795 if he doesnt win i think they can handle it
1562796 im opposed to that so i thought id put my two cents in
1562797 its not very transparent and there seems to be in that particular set up no accountability until the school district can be more transparent in what they want to spend their tax moneys for i dont think they should be looking for applying for more taxes
1562798 all of those were sent six years ago and unr police chief adam garcia made it clear that was unacceptable behavior and we have seen no mass e mails since
1562799 however recently one or more officers self reported that they had forwarded one or two such e mails not to the whole force but to another individual on the force
1562800 from my perspective we are not planning to do more
1562801 chief garcia has reinforced his position several times about the inappropriateness of such e mails
1562802 is comfortable the university has done what it needs to do with the scope of the issue
1562803 were glad that we can help the fire department do what they need to do
1562804 the reaction was very favorable even though we didnt have the costumes and all the props
1562805 it made me feel good about the band itself because everybody just came to play
1562806 a lot of the fans asked questions about why we didnt have the costumes once they heard what had happened and once they understood they had a good time it all worked out
1562807 he went back there and arrested the guys right there on the spot
1562808 it was a father and son the father lived in reno and the son in salt lake
1562809 all we got back really is one of my bass guitars one saxophone flute a couple mikes and some symbols
1562810 our costumes we had some witnesses who had seen those guys throw those costumes in trash cans
1562811 were a little shy of a few things here and there but were in pretty good shape
1562812 but this cycle weve seen a change from the grass roots level all the way up not just in terms of party registration but in terms of fundraising as well
1562813 but im not convinced it takes all of that to be effective im having a really good time walking and meeting a lot of folks and getting a really good response
1562814 generally speaking fundraising is down with the economy having slowed
1562815 this is the second year ive had it here and people are really drawn to it
1562816 the first question they ask is do you drive it
1562817 if you dont drive them and use them as far as im concerned theyre not worth anything
1562818 i dont mind showing it off and talking about it but driving it is what i really love to do its not to be fussed and stewed over its meant to be driven
1562819 it was so original it was like a time warp
1562820 i thought holy mackeral this is unbelievable the originality of the thing is just mind boggling
1562821 im going to cruise sparks well probably go up to virginia city too
1562822 its just an offshoot in terms of funding community activities they stand behind their efforts and positions with their pocketbooks
1562823 if we werent there somebody else may have been shot and they probably wouldnt know what to do
1562824 its going to happen cadets its just a matter of time before you run into somebody that doesnt speak english hopefully its not a high risk situation
1562825 its a safety feature we will be able to communicate and help our community quicker as well as our safety
1562826 hispanics are more likely to talk to us and when people are wanting to talk to police then were solving more crimes
1562827 in case of an emergency theyll know whats going and it might help out a little more
1562828 im in my 50s now but when i was 18 19 20 everybody had a volkswagen
1562829 its nice to see them on the road i wouldnt mind having another one
1562830 this is probably the first import that kind of took over america it was a good car and it was affordable
1562831 what the heck we might as well take 2 days off and go there
1562832 i dont appreciate you attempting to humiliate me like that im going to the office and ask to be transferred to another class

1562854 we do not need to predict the future to see some of the ways in which the strength of a culture depends upon the behavior of its members a culture that maintains civil order and defends itself against attack frees its members from certain kinds of threats and presumably provides more time and energy for other things particularly if of order and security are not maintained by force a culture needs its strength must depend in part on the economic contingencies which maintain enterprising and productive labor the availability of the tools of production and a culture is presumably stronger if it induces its members to maintain a safe and healthful environment to provide medical care and to maintain a population density appropriate to its resources and space a culture must be transmitted from generation to generation and its strength will presumably depend on what and how much its new members learn either through informal instructional contingencies or in educational institutions a culture needs the support of its members and it must provide for the pursuit and achievement of happiness if it is to prevent disaffection or defection a culture mus be reasonably stable but it must also change and it will presumably be strongest if it can avoid excessive respect for tradition and fear of novelty on the one hand and excessively rapid change on the other lastly a culture will have a special measure of survival value if it encourages its members to examine its practices and to experiment with new ones

1562857 in some ways i smile at the success of wii knowing that it was playstation that kind of emancipated people from the keyboard mouse and joystick with eyetoy
1562858 then with the success of that we said that if we really want to bring in a much bigger audience we ought to look at this in other ways and thats what gave life to singstar and even something like buzz
1562859 and i think now obviously wii has taken that concept and turned it into a console so good on them smiles

1562861 i got this great idea for a movie its about aspbergers and its gonna be about you i was so like wtf man why would you make a movie about me i aint what youd call interesting i dont really have much of a life man

1562864 what if come january 2009 i realize its all been a case of better the arrogant lulu fancying devil you know
1562865 it belongs to the park but i tend to it now and again why do you ask
1562866 herbert was a park ranger who was seduced into living in the innermost tower of cobweb forest it is unknown as to what really happened but now all he does is look upon the meriads of shining lights in that strange tree he is still human supposedly but no longer needs sustainance he gets it from the tree as if he too has roots maybe he does but he doesnt need the jewel
1562867 the jewel is like an alarm clock and the book is its off switch the book needs a key to be opened
1562868 otherwise it cannot be read and the jewel cannot be pacified if it is not at peace then the whole forest will awaken and it is best left asleep
1562869 you must choose from one of the three keys that i protect only one will be cool enough to touch
1562870 what have you to say in coming here have you brought a gift
1562871 where is my gift bring me something of adornment something beautiful and of value and i will give you one still the greater in return
1562872 though bread is beautiful to the sight of one who is starving and the wrapper in which it lives is attractive to the eye i require not food rather bring me something that will last and that is costly and desirable bring me this and i will give in return something greater
1562873 yeah a former park ranger something happened to him or something when he first ventured into the cobweb forest now hes so enamoured with those dancing lights hes literally rooted himself to that spot it was said that herbert guarded something of great value right before he started guarding the cobweb forest
1562874 why he would want the jewel is beyond my knowledge he already owns something just as valueable
1562875 he said he would give something of value in return
1562876 why didnt you say so if it will make him let go of whatever it is he guards then sure just be sure to come back and let me see what hes been guarding all that time but you still must choose among three keys that rest in my campfire the jewel is attatched to all sorts of traps and a key will get you on your way
1562877 its so awful attacking your child it is the worst thing i know to shout loudly at this fifty pound being with his huge trusting brown eyes it s like bitch slapping e t
1562878 america is finished we are going to destroy this country our economy is just going to unravel
1562879 the question is how much money is the world going to lose before it writes us off
1562880 if it looks like a bubble walks like a bubble and quacks like a bubble its a bubble
1562881 the government doesnt have the balls to raise taxes its going to print the money its going to destroy the currency
1562882 authoritative articles about specific topics written by people who know about those subjects
1562883 the game is going to give guitar and music a boost
1562884 and its also going to give new life to all these songs it may turn a lot of musicians into gamers and gamers into musicians
1562885 whats better than to create a game about us and base it around where weve played and how do a bunch of guys from yonkers and new hampshire make it big
1562886 theres a couple of things on the roster that are going to be pretty cool as well
1562887 obviously you do the math look at the size and how big the banjo team currently needs to be how big our shared technology group and asset group are look at the number of games and how theyre staggered and how many teams we have theres about half the studio missing from the release schedule at the moment
1562888 wed be stupid not to look at the lostwinds world
1562889 one of the problems of writing games is that youre expecting to do well because its your baby and you love it but im very pleased with what we did
1562890 it reminds me of development a long time ago where three or four months seemed like a long time

1562947 voltei recife foi a saudade que me trouxe pelo braco
1562948 theres nothing we can do about a strike if they choose to make one short of capitulating or closing shop thats the asymmetric advantage they enjoy over their opponents
1562949 but i know the taliban are right they want to bring islam
1562950 if you dont like my peaches dont shake my tree
1562951 theres a set of tools called edge that were developed on the naughty dog premises actually by a group of very very senior games programmer some from naughty dog and some from elsewhere
1562952 thats why we think were probably only using 30 or 40 percent of the power of the ps3 right now and theres this great untapped potential
1562953 i am concerned about ageing odour and know there are anti ageing odour products but have not bought them myself
1562954 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odourless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1562955 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odour products is growing
1562956 the real strength of boxing is that it reaches the people other sports cant
1562957 i want to see boxing return to schools because it can play a real role in tackling obesity is great for discipline and as many an ex boxer will tell you provides a real alternative to gang culture i also want to see us unearth more olympic medallists
1562958 my engineer tom brown and i were pulling of the interstate and i had a huge smile on my face
1562959 when we first started in the indycar series there were a bunch of tracks that were very similar and kentucky stood out as one that took a little different technique to drive and it really fit what i like to do in a race car
1562960 i know exactly where that particular bump is on the track
1562961 theres lot of consistency and thats really important its nice to be able to bring dollar general here because as well as weve done here in the past i think our chances are pretty good to do that again
1562962 weve had two months to prepare to get back on track
1562963 were still building weve done some things that we wanted to do that we werent prepared to do for indy to the race car
1562964 gooseair one eleven contact vancouver ground on 127 15 when clear
1562965 so lets start this discussion off with something ive been wondering since my mom died it comforts me to believe that god intended to take her at that moment for a reason that she didnt suffer for nothing that hehas a plan for everything but then does that mean i still can make choices that i still have free will
1562966 presentaremos un equipo atractivo y yo podr a por supuesto aportar alguna cosa especialmente tras el descr dito total del gobierno de gran coalici n entre socialdem cratas y democristianos

1562968 los tibetanos y sus seguidores en todo el mundo condenan el intento del gobierno chino de usar los juegos de 2008 para cubrir su ocupaci n del t bet y su actual campa a de represi n sobre los tibetanos que luchan por sus derechos b sicos y libertades
1562969 siento el dolor que he causado por favor no odien que esto les otorgue la compensaci n emocional que est n buscando
1562970 ahora voy a esperar cada d a cada d a de mi vida a que los otros cinco responsables de la muerte de mi hija sean ajusticiados

1562972 agot todas las instancias legales a su alcance tanto internas como internacionales con el fin de obtener la revisi n y reconsideraci n del caso a la luz de la falta de notificaci n consular
1562973 continuar insistiendo en la obligaci n de estados unidos de otorgar la revisi n y reconsideraci n de las condenas de pena de muerte
1562974 los reporteros y los corresponsales est n muy enojados con usted
1562975 you have a style of writing i just cant do
1562976 a fines de julio de 2005 directivos del m s alto nivel de esa compa a editorial decidieron intervenir y darle un giro de 180 grados al contenido del semanario ordenaron no publicar material que incluso ya se encontraba impreso listo para su distribuci n
1562977 ante la imposibilidad de seguir haciendo periodismo la mayor parte de los editores reporteros columnistas dise adores y fot grafos decidimos renunciar
1562978 por cierto pese a que hab a anunciado que asistir a a la posada la directora nunca lleg
1562979 te juro que te defend lo m s que pude pero ya conoces a la directora est furiosa contigo
1562980 men can only be happy when they do not assume that the object of life is happiness
1562981 if liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
1562982 to see what is in front of ones nose needs a constant struggle
1562983 many people genuinely do not wish to be saints and it is possible that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never had much temptation to be human beings
1562984 speaking the truth in times of universal deceit is a revolutionary act
1562985 to see what is in front of ones nose requires a constant struggle
1562986 for a creative writer possession of the truth is less important than emotional sincerity
1562987 every generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it and wiser than the one that comes after it
1562988 all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others
1562989 the quickest way of ending a war is to lose it
1562990 an autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful
1562991 saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent
1562992 at age 50 every man has the face he deserves
1562993 on the whole human beings want to be good but not too good and not quite all the time
1562994 advertising is the rattling of a stick inside a swill bucket
1562995 political language and with variations this is true of all political parties from conservatives to anarchists is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
1562996 if liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
1562997 you you and you panic the rest of you come with me
1562998 good for the environment good for you and good for our family

1563000 no es de extra ar que el sub sea un traidor el problema estriba en su origen de clase
1563001 con la ca da del socialismo real me qued sin asideros no me quedo de otra m s que aceptar esto
1563002 despite the fact that ive always spoken positively of the olympic ideal and never called for a boycott or asked an athlete to break an ioc international olympic committee rule my visa was revoked less than 24 hours before my scheduled departure
1563003 the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
1563004 for five weeks the sun times sought to interview obama about rezko and the housing deals
1563005 putting pressure on bureaucrats to give a crony a contract worth 855 000 in personal fees is beyond favor and enters the realm of corrupt deal
1563006 to take delegates from a candidate and give them to another candidate is quite incredible
1563007 the delegate allocation that the michigan challenge proposes has no foundation in law or rule
1563008 neither the dnc rules nor the michigan delegate selection plan allow arbitrary reallocation of uncommitted delegates to a candidate or arbitrary reallocation of delegates from one candidate to another
1563009 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1563010 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1563011 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
1563012 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1563013 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1563014 we have learnt she is not participating after failing a dope test
1563015 were looking at beijing as a world class stage to prove we belong
1563016 were not looking to be eliminated from the games were hoping to be back for 2016
1563017 the ioc president and others made it clear of the requirement to end games in a timely manner
1563018 we strive to bring baseball back to the olympic programme and the are our last opportunity to collectively impress ioc members on the field international olympic committee that not only does our game belong alongside the other great sports of the world but our sport is manageable from a television and operational standpoint
1563019 i think some countries are like were never going to be like that
1563020 i make an appeal to the governments to accelerate the ratification of the unesco treaty
1563021 i call upon national olympic committees and international federations that we meet the deadline of compliance
1563022 together we must and will continue to become more and more effective in stemming the scourge of doping
1563023 we can be sure that whoever dopes risks getting caught and testing will be more frequent and significant than any other games
1563024 i call upon the national olympic committees and international federations to be sure that we meet the deadline of compliance
1563025 i make an appeal to governments to accelerate the ratification of the unesco treaty
1563026 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1563027 i felt a little bit embarrassed talking about doping when my country had not signed
1563028 wada will give every assistance for all stakeholders to be compliant by november
1563029 the real onus is on the countries and sports federations to ensure that the athletes who have been sent to beijing are clean
1563030 wada the ioc and bocog beijings organizing committee cannot guarantee that all athletes at the games will not try to dope
1563031 i have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit
1563032 i have no doubts that when i line up next week i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean
1563033 that is such a disgrace and ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar
1563034 we agree with tamsyn that its a problem but its a problem that the ioc is throwing enormous efforts at to solve
1563035 i think the best attitude for athletes here is to concentrate on their performances and leave the detection of cheats to the appropriate authorities
1563036 tamsyns free to speak out as much as she wants but if shes got any specific allegations to make about anyone she should raise them with us and well forward it to the ioc
1563037 trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he will keep your paths straight
1563038 this was our worst effort i wouldnt say effort this is our worst performance
1563039 i dont think we were as sharp as we have been i dont think we played very well or not up to what we can play
1563040 we are not happy at all with the way we played i think we could have done much better
1563041 we broke down on defense and let the other team get open looks
1563042 we cant have mental breakdowns like those because these teams are tough and really know how to shoot the ball
1563043 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first games where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1563044 weve won four games here and now its a matter of winning eight games in a row

1563096 neither of these theories however is sufficient to represent the nature of learning in the online world there is an assumption in both theories that the learning process should happen organically but that knowledge or what is to be learned is still something independently verifiable with a definitive beginning and end goal determined by curriculum
1563097 knowledge as negotiation is not an entirely new concept in educational circles social contructivist and connectivist pedagogies for instance are centered on the process of negotiation as a learning process neither of these theories however is sufficient to represent the nature of learning in the online world there is an assumption in both theories that the learning process should happen organically but that knowledge or what is to be learned is still something independently verifiable with a definitive beginning and end goal determined by curriculum a botanical metaphor first posited by deleuze and guattari in a thousand plateaus 1987 may offer a more flexible conception of knowledge for the information age the rhizome a rhizomatic plant has no center and no defined boundary rather it is made up of a number of semi independent nodes each of which is capable of growing and spreading on its own bounded only by the limits of its habitat cormier 2008 in the rhizomatic view knowledge can only be negotiated and the contextual collaborative learning experience shared by constructivist and connectivist pedagogies is a social as well as a personal knowledge creation process with mutable goals and constantly negotiated premises the rhizome metaphor which represents a critical leap in coping with the loss of a canon against which to compare judge and value knowledge may be particularly apt as a model for disciplines on the bleeding edge where the canon is fluid and knowledge is a moving target

1563165 climate change might not be as bad as some people say
1563166 warming of the climate system is unequivocal as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level
1563167 since 2000 the world has gone ballistic in terms of carbon emissions
1563168 sceptics are supported by politically powerful conservative think tanks funded by wealthy foundations and corporations
1563169 environmental scepticism is an elite driven reaction to global environmentalism organised by core actors within the conservative movement

1563178 governments will benefit they have been trying to find a popular tax for years this could be the opportunity they have been waiting for they should beware though the electorate might see through this quite quickly once the taxes begin to bite
1563179 the nuclear industry will benefit no one wants to live next to a nuclear power station but some governments have already started removing steps from the planning negotiation process to speed up their deployment
1563180 global cooling will be a more serious problem than global warming we should start planning now how we are going to decommission those new nuclear power stations when they are under a mile of ice

1563238 should not be demonised and we should not be cutting back on capacity at a time when people want to fly more
1563239 there is no chance for the climate without tackling aviation
1563240 you may say that the expansion of london stansted airport will play only a small part in increasing climate change but everyone can say that about almost everything they do it is an excuse for doing nothing
1563241 the serious consequences affecting my people today will affect your people tomorrow
1563242 but what if there is an unequal distribution of skill and ability within the human population

1563245 there will be catastrophic economic and social consequences if we fail to act
1563246 this is what i would describe as the foothills of peak oil
1563247 the worlds oil and gas resources are sufficient to sustain economic growth for the forseeable future
1563248 for three years the oil supply has been a zero sum game in which if one country consumes more another has to consume less
1563249 all it needs is some brave political leadership what a terrifying thought
1563250 we cannot support any renewable generation proposal which would have a significant and adverse impact on wildlife and habitats particularly sites which are protected by law specifically for their wildlife value
1563251 could generate large quantities of electricity contribute to stabilising co2 emissions and add to the diversity of the uks energy supply
1563252 have a potentially useful role in tackling the issues of climate change and energy supply
1563253 we have some difficult choices to make if we are going to get serious about reducing the impact of climate change on the natural environment
1563254 as it happens economists have a curious habit of affixing numbers to complicated transactions consider the efforts to save the northern spotted owl from extinction one economic study found that in order to protect roughly five thousand owls the opportunity costs that is the income surrendered by the logging industry and others would be 46 billion or just over 9 million per owl
1563255 until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
1563256 while there has been a downward trend in real commodity prices of 1
1563257 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds
1563258 rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1563259 caregivers are not well served by court battles and legal fees rather they would have been far better off if state officials worked together with our industry to raise awareness about video game ratings and the parental controls available on all new game consoles both of which help ensure that the games children play are parent approved
1563260 it is unfortunate that the state is stubbornly pursuing an appeal that is likely to lead to even more court awarded fees
1563261 schwarzenegger makes layoffs orders pay cuts for california state workers
1563262 homestar ruiner is a great series premiere and kick off for the season the next five months will be filled with lots of surprises
1563263 this is how we always envisioned episodic gaming monthly releases straight into the living room were happy to be working with the chapmans and nintendo to make it a reality
1563264 our last game topped out at 8 bits weve heard this one might reach 9 or 10
1563265 basically the psp version was cancelled because of control issues big willy unleashed was designed by a wii developer specifically for the wii when it was ported over to the psp the controls simply didnt translate well and instead of pushing out the product with translated controls it was cancelled
1563266 for ground source heat pumps while 100 grants were made in the last three months of 2006 the equivalent number for 2007 was zero
1563267 k either he won the lottery or he s going to tell us that the mcrib just came back
1563268 this was our worst effort i wouldnt say effort this is our worst performance
1563269 i dont think we were as sharp as we have been i dont think we played very well or not up to what we can play
1563270 we are not happy at all with the way we played i think we could have done much better
1563271 we are going to play much better defense i think you have to give some credit to the australian team because they executed very well
1563272 we broke down on defense and let the other team get open looks
1563273 we cant have mental breakdowns like those because these teams are tough and really know how to shoot the ball
1563274 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first games where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1563275 weve won four games here and now its a matter of winning eight games in a row
1563276 its clear that testosterone increases aggressive behavior thats why teens tend to exhibit risk taking when you make the level super physiologic theres a wide range but in general theres an increase in aggressiveness
1563277 we have yet to achieve bias free health care this has serious public health implications as we know that higher levels of screening lead to lower levels of mortality clinicians need to be aware that they may be sending signals even unintentionally that lead minorities to believe they are being discriminated against
1563278 respondents answered yes or no to was there ever a time that you would have gotten better medical care if you had belonged to a different ethnic group however we were not able to ask why they felt discriminated against
1563279 this contradicts the general assumption in public health that having a usual source of care is a cure all
1563280 if men felt discriminated against by their regular health care provider they did not receive screening so there is something else factoring in
1563281 for example african american men may be stereotyped as being more violent which would affect how doctors respond to them and thus create a potential for discrimination
1563282 the longer someone delays screening the worse the outcome perception of discrimination may be driving the differences we see in outcomes among minorities
1563283 hes behind but well work to get him up to speed and we know hes the kind of player who will get himself caught up
1563284 right from the start through the draft and minicamps he has shown us things that are innate to successful nfl linebackers
1563285 i want to catch up quick on what i missed and move forward as fast as i can
1563286 cap and share is a way of upping the price of fossil fuels and recycling the money to citizens it is rationing at the top level rather than at the level of individuals
1563287 is at least as much if not more worrying than the converse since it points to the possibility of runaway warming
1563288 to scale up what we already know how to do
1563289 there is nothing we can do to stop this nor should we try
1563290 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1563291 an image a day and an mp3 to go with it for no obvious reason
1563292 so take it all the way down alllll the way down
1563293 22 of americans believe any state or religion has the right to peaceably secede and become an independent republic
1563294 so all these people have the law wrong and dont seem to know the basics of the history of the civil war
1563295 h ere is an applicaton to make a new state at the instance of the parties desiring to be made a new state and nobody else consenting it is the party applying for admission consenting to the admission

1563297 well havent you heard dr opinion that single moms should never date until their children are 18 how is this going to affect your daughter
1563298 you hear people say our universe is fine tuned for life that stars are rare and couldnt form if certain things were different
1563299 you can change alpha or the gravitational constant by a factor of 100 and stars still form
1563300 you have no idea what life would be like in a universe with different constants
1563301 how would god vote why the bible commands you to be a conservative

1563307 that mcclellan believed his own numbers there was no attempt to deceive people in washington
1563308 the truth of the matter is that george mcclellan had lost the courage to command
1563309 they were published in book form by librarie chaix in paris the printing firm owned by cheret and subscriptions were taken four posters were sent every month
1563310 london transport museum cares for one of the finest poster archives in the world for 100 years since frank pick commissioned the first graphic poster for london underground the company and its successors have kept copies of everything they produced in the early 20th century under picks guidance london transport commissioned work from the best artists and designers in the world
1563311 in 1923 marketer charles rosenfeld and chicago printer charles mather teamed up to begin selling subscriptions to an annual poster series for motivating and inspiring workers
1563312 every week companies changed posters based on their sequence number workers needs or current events mather conveniently categorized each poster thematically from laziness responsibility mistakes and unprogressiveness to fire prevention and even practical joking
1563313 the mather posters were tightly integrated advertising messages a bold headline a catchy image to match and beautiful lithography and design that made the next weeks poster something to look forward to seeing
1563314 mather created about 350 different images before the series came to an abrupt end with the stock market crash in 1929 jobs were hard to come by and employers didnt have the cash or the need to motivate workers as they had in the salad days of the twenties today the posters represent a snapshot of their time cars fashions and values portrayed in a homespun way that at times seems foreign and at others a lot like today

1563323 ante at 8 15 16 citation omitted because neither of these justifications is sound i respectfully dissent
1563324 i would highly recommend bill to any company in need of a strong charismatic people oriented leader a leader to whom of course vicki chuck forgets to mention that she got fired bill axline is only a leader to his monkeys of which vixki chuck is one his solid knowledge of sales and marketing coupled with his strong orientation to operational and financial metrics makes him the consummate president ceo or general manager vicki chuck knows almost nothing about business fluidmaster was failing financially after bill axline influenced its finances operations too bill axline had the inventory piled to the ceiling fluidmaster was healthy prior to bill axline so he cant manage finances nor operations bill is a phenomenol communicator and a natural leader he does talk the talk but communicators need to listen too bill axline only listens to his own hot air his knowledge of general business and the marketplace is unparalled
1563325 bill is a change for the better driver with a keen focus on continuous improvement in all facets of the business willing to listen to input from all comers bill reaps the best ideas to keep progress moving forward what improvements bill takes the best ideas only from his loyal servants who already agree with him bill is an open door leader with a keen eye for good people bill axline refused to meet with many employees especially when there was confrontation involved he readily sees through fluff and wants people to work to a plan with a schedule with commitments responsibilities and data even handed and fair bill was a pleasure to work for and with
1563326 bill is a great visionary and a strong leader he has all the skills and expereince to run any company he knows how to motivate people lead develop new products and grow market share wheres the proof fluidmaster market share shrank under bill axlines leadership while at the same time watching the bottom line i learned a lot from working with bill he helped me develop my skills and the vision to be a more effective leader bill axline and vicki chuck fired bill anti i guess its now server him to rub bill axlines fat belly once again bill will be an outstanding asset to any company
1563327 bill has a great business sense and is able to motivate teams in both good and bad times a strong leader who is well respected by both customers and employees
1563328 he is probably in the middle of a blow job right now
1563329 many developers used to spend money lavishly now it is time to rethink expenses
1563330 big developers like us can afford bulk buying and cut costs
1563331 when you set up a company employees become part of your growth you cannot penalise staff in bad times but we can certainly cut overheads
1563332 instead of three years we can finish projects in two and a half years and save time and overheads instead of firing employees putting a little pressure on them to finish the projects early makes sense
1563333 maybe one of the most surprising things in the poll is that even though china as a country has been isolated from the outside world for such a long time majorities in britain the us and india still see the chinese as friendly and over half in the us and britain think that the chinese are like them
1563334 theres still a strong perception in the west that the chinese are oppressed
1563335 the protests weve seen about chinas human rights record ahead of the olympics will only have increased that sense
1563336 theres not much evidence here of a desire to blame china for the big global problems were currently faced with like rising energy prices or food prices
1563337 and its surprising that despite all the concern about the growth in chinas carbon emissions its people in the other big emerging economies like brazil or india that are more likely to blame china for climate change
1563338 i f ever the offer was commended again in violation of the pledges given by the democratic party to the american people sooner let his tongue cleave to the roof of his mouth than he would defend that party which should yield one inch of oregon

1563370 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1563371 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police
1563372 if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up
1563373 i recently had a radio gig with natasha bedingfield and we were backstage and we were talking and we swapped numbers i was like lets get together and write something lets do something lets go to the studio and jam she was down i would love to do something with her shes an amazing vocalist

1563380 despite campaigning for four years and running unopposed in his primary jay nixon has been unable to solidify enough support to win the general election and the contrast between jay nixon and kenny hulshof couldnt be a better match up for us kenny gives us a great shot because hes the right guy for the job
1563381 bitterness and anger i just dont have time for that anymore
1563382 this is one of those cases that if the job had been done right in the first place not only would an innocent man have been protected but dozens of other victims would have been spared these attacks by a serial offender

1563387 all the suites had dirty cells and inadequately cleaned showers there was limited access to showers and toilet paper and all staff did not carry ligature knives and none routinely carried keys
1563388 this problem was acute at southwark a suite run entirely on overtime and which in spite of an earlier extremely critical internal report was still unfit for use being both unhygienic and unsafe
1563389 conditions in the cells were squalid and lacked decency there was hair and pubic hair on mattress plinths and congealed blood and human waste on some walls

1563413 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1563414 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures

1563417 i told the kids i couldnt afford to take them anywhere so ill just take them to the boardwalk
1563418 it went up and tilted and the platform opened up halfway and closed again thats when kids started yelling and panicked
1563419 kids were screaming and i reached my arms out and pushed him sebastian away from the flapping ramp as im pulling him toward me i noticed the cage was bent in and the floor was bent underneath him so i held onto him tight
1563420 you could tell it the ride was pretty much out of control and coming apart

1563425 i hope theyll see that we are out and were watching them and they see our signs and say hey maybe i shouldnt go through there
1563426 i think the incident kind of really brought us together and really brought out the need that we would come together as a whole community

1563459 had met with economic advisers and business leaders in washington last week and they had advised him to call for tapping the government reserve
1563460 team obama cast the proposal as a refinement rather than a flip flop on obamas previous opposition to tapping the 770 million barrel reserve

1563473 actually saw one lay dead on the pizza counter it was actually disturbing
1563474 it has been shown that flies are able to carry bacteria and probably viruses on their feet acquired when they land on contaminated material
1563475 flies picked up streptococci and staphylococci from skin infections and carried it on their feet to another person

1563482 walking into camp wenonah was like being on an episode of mtv cribs only instead of hummers on 20
1563483 it was amazing to see what the people who built the mine were able to accomplish using the technology they had and being surrounded by nothing but wilderness
1563484 you can read about things but they grab you when you sight them first hand
1563485 you got to feel like you were actually a part of the rich history of the park
1563486 overall it was a fabulous trip we did really wonderful things and they all enjoyed it

1563507 because theres a lot of factors that go into that ill get together post practice watch the tape
1563508 i just want to go through the week finish up the practices finish up the meetings with the coaches with mike and then go from there

1563510 we survived the killing fields and well survive religious invasion too
1563511 give me liberty of my faith or give me death
1563512 set a mechanism by which we can reasonably and peaceably decide who are the proper custodian and members of the church
1563513 we are appealing it because i think that is too much for me
1563514 im disappointed because im hurt i got my left hand hurt and my right hand i know im going to get suspended but not like for five days maybe three or two games i agree with that but five games i think is a lot
1563515 my ballclub is going through a pretty tough time right now and i got to be with them 100 percent i let my club down for two days
1563516 this team can play without me i believe in my coaches i believe in the club i dont think this team will play any differently having me here or not
1563517 i dont ever look forward to being away from the competition it is their decision i dont have the advantage of the appeal process so ive got to serve mine tonight
1563518 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1563519 i thought i might get suspended but i wasnt sure for how long
1563520 five days is a long time i was surprised it was that for that long still everything is in the beginning stages im not an expert on it
1563521 he didnt really try to fight olivo really or anyone
1563522 weve got to 10 days now until we play chivas and the chivas game now becomes a must win game for us we need to get back to winning im fed up and the rest of the players are fed up with not winning games and we need to turn it around quickly
1563523 there is this madness around me around my family without a doubt out on the field is where im most comfortable where im happiest because i know what im doing and i know i can do it
1563524 i never do anything where i dont believe in what im doing i see that something could happen in u s soccer that change isnt going to happen in a year or two its more of a 5 10 or even 15 year plan i believe in it and i believe that in years to come this could be one of the biggest sports here in america
1563525 im a really bad loser it stays with me for a while i always take it quite personally when we dont win as a team or i dont win in everything else i do
1563526 he still doesnt have 100 percent extension which is normal that will happen in the next few weeks we feel confident hell be ready without question by the end of the month
1563527 just another position change trying to get used to that stance again
1563528 ill end up in my guard stance once or twice
1563529 weve got a breeze and i kind of felt we were in april overall the tempo was good and we got a lot of good work done
1563530 any time you have surgery in that area there are some risks
1563531 but i think dr riew was so confident in this procedure it put me at ease everyone i asked said he was the best
1563532 it definitely felt a lot better after they did it than it did before
1563533 he said as soon as im ready to go i can go full bore
1563534 thats been the situation pretty much ever since ive been here new guys coming in
1563535 and i think thats what the leagues all about competition it breeds intense play
1563536 i try to go out there every day and work hard like ive always done and be smart learn the offense make the right decisions and make plays when i can
1563537 danes dane i dont know any other way to describe him
1563538 the guy knows every position he could kick or punt if we had to hes doing a great job in the receiver spot handling all the positions and basically being ready to step in wherever needed
1563539 the guys value really theres no limit to it i just think hes a really really good football player
1563540 i used to watch the draft real close and i used to check the guys out when they came in
1563541 but you know what ive always felt that if someones going to come in and take my spot if someones going to outwork me and outplay me then all the best to him
1563542 hes going to get some good work in tennessee too as we go through it hes going to be working with the first unit for the most part
1563543 i think there are a lot of similarities he thoroughly enjoyed and benefited from his time in boston i say the same about the new york yankees again it was time for me to leave it was uncomfortable the last year or so certainly got a lot of benefit from it
1563544 i think a big part of it is the ballclub made a trade that right away is going to help this ballclub everybody personality wise seems to be in a better place because he certainly is a threat firsthand for me watching him on the other side of the field for 12 years was certainly intimidating its nice to know hes hitting for us in that four hole now
1563545 i feel like manny is the best righthanded hitter ive ever seen
1563546 to me hes pretty much as good as it gets hes a worker i know people dont want to think that but he works his butt off he has a great time playing
1563547 doesnt mean we get to sit back and say ok manny is going to carry us here you go buddy that would be unfair to him and shame on us
1563548 from my perspective when he played against me whatever his motivation was he still scared the hell out of me because i still knew what he could do because of his ability thats what i hope happens here
1563549 the most anticlimactic part of this is that i cant express the feeling
1563550 you know the feeling but you cant describe it i wish i had the words
1563551 not the kind of poor we see in the u s
1563552 she is very nice she cooks for everyone on the team
1563553 get up and question when jean gives them time off and tells the children to have no mercy on opponents perhaps all outgrowths of a childhood episode in which she killed a snake to purge her fear of them

1563556 i dont think i was very sharp but i would have gotten some outs today
1563557 i didnt have a second thought about throwing a curve i feel ready to go
1563558 i guess it would depend on the results of my pitching saturday
1563559 im not very far from being more consistent im one or two throws from being where i need to be
1563560 will dominate the entire downtown st louis for four days
1563561 things change with construction but were looking at our options
1563562 they wanted us to be more aggressive and stop all that lovey dovey stuff
1563563 because were not here to be friends were here to get some work done
1563564 when you start going against another team and youre blocking people with different colored jerseys on things really change and thats what i want to see from us
1563565 the part that you have to keep an eye on is that it doesnt get out of hand
1563566 first of all they have a different defensive structure so offensively were lining up against somebody that plays a different philosophy
1563567 i think the whole idea is it ups the competitive level of practice
1563568 theres no knute rockne speeches needed you go out there and youre ready to go but youre also able to get real quality work

1563572 the flag of the dalai lamas former tibetan government flew from the pocket of the one of the protesters after an hour fire trucks pulled up and the protesters were peacefully led away by police and members of the internal security force tethong said
1563573 we have not had any contact with them because their phones are off
1563574 at this moment the tibetans inside tibet are brutally and violently being crushed by chinese authorities
1563575 its absolutely critical that a message is sent to the chinese government to meaningfully address and end violence and repression in tibet or they will never be truly accepted by the international community
1563576 i have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit
1563577 i have no doubts that when i line up next week i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean
1563578 that is such a disgrace and ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar
1563579 we agree with tamsyn that its a problem but its a problem that the ioc is throwing enormous efforts at to solve
1563580 i think the best attitude for athletes here is to concentrate on their performances and leave the detection of cheats to the appropriate authorities
1563581 tamsyns free to speak out as much as she wants but if shes got any specific allegations to make about anyone she should raise them with us and well forward it to the ioc
1563582 its not just about the sport its about the image of china
1563583 chairman mao would have been happy if he were here today
1563584 it is frustrating to find that that kind of planned cheating is going on
1563585 id say 70 out of a 100 athletes in the olympic village smoke
1563586 i always say im not an athlete im a normal guy with a passion for weightlifting
1563587 if we dont get a strong number oil prices will likely fall further
1563588 elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1563589 i expect prices to fall to between 100 and 110 by the end of the year
1563590 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1563591 unless something really weird happens i dont see the fed moving before the november election
1563592 the fed doesnt like to be in the spotlight during the heat of a presidential campaign
1563593 i think they will prefer waiting now until they can get a better view of how the economy is unfolding and see if financial markets become less fragile
1563594 the board will keep an open mind of course for an offer of the whole company that reflects fair value
1563595 to gain a recommendation from the board and the right to conduct due diligence any proposal must recognize the value of our unique set of assets and must contain a sufficient control premium and this proposal did not reach the mark
1563596 that the torch is finally in beijing is a realization of a dream weve had for a hundred years

1563599 all i know is that i have a person whos shot here
1563600 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
1563601 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
1563602 labour have said over and over that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
1563603 in countries with good standards of healthcare the possibility for insects or pests to transmit infections in hospitals would be very remote
1563604 in the uk wounds are treated appropriately and dressings applied to ensure good hygiene and prevent infection
1563605 how can patients be safe amid bedbugs fleas and rats these findings reveal what happens when money is taken away from where patients expect to see it spent
1563606 if these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business
1563607 clearly it may be necessary to take action against pests in these large public buildings from time to time
1563608 however it is important for hospital trusts to have robust procedures in place to deal with any pest problems
1563609 the hygiene code requires nhs bodies to have a pest control policy that anticipates and manages this issue
1563610 trusts should take rapid action and follow through with surveillance in place to avoid pest incidents and minimize hazards
1563611 use of pest control is a sign of good proactive management
1563612 these trends suggest that financial gains for insurers do not translate into improved access to care or financial protection for individuals

1563622 weve had 18 practices so far and they mean a lot but the games mean a lot too
1563623 well all see how everybody does on thursday and thatll be where theyre getting hit and situations change from play to play
1563624 i think just getting a little bit of work like today starting to move forward is going to be a big plus for me
1563625 if bills going to put me in there ill play but one practice usually isnt enough for bill
1563626 weve told everyone to be ready to go and they will be
1563627 i dont think its been that different than its been the past couple years
1563628 im not sure whether hell be ready to go thursday
1563629 well put him in the mix and hell be ready to go next week
1563630 you violated new hampshire statute 540a 3 certain specific acts prohibited when you allowed the nashua fire department into our house at 12 fulton st nashua n h without our knowledge or consent on 12 july 03
1563631 these violations are unacceptable and have created an atmosphere such that we can never be sure that you do not or will not come into our house whenever you feel like it
1563632 and that if i didnt let them in they would come back with a warrant
1563633 they clearly led me to believe i had no choice since they are directed under state law to inspect all rental units
1563634 once you get to the point where a judge has determined that the statute has been violated there is no discretion
1563635 he has to award statutory damages so the only issue is how much in the way of damages the tenant is entitled to
1563636 requires no evidence of damages but only a finding that the landlord did in fact violate 540 a 3
1563637 that was one of the uncontestable arguments raised on behalf of mr young
1563638 that this was an inexperienced landlord an individual who is not sophisticated in rental property business who ostensibly decided to lease a structure he had built himself to an acquaintance
1563639 he built this one house and he leased it to mr simpson and that was the end of his foray into rental properties
1563640 in connection with a missing person report back in the early 1990s
1563641 our experience tells us hes more of a schemer than someone who has lost his memory
1563642 he loves his daughter kidnapping doesnt apply it was his own kid
1563643 just because hes reighs natural father it doesnt absolve him
1563644 we are proud that we are able to make a big leap forward in achieving our hotels vision that is to be the preferred 5 star business class hotel in malaysia and a testimony of our continued commitment to provide guests with excellent service and quality standards complemented by grandeur elegance and unequalled amenities and facilities
1563645 we are confident that we will be able to maintain the standards of service and products that are in line with the 5 star guidelines set by the ministry moreover we are committed to providing personalized service that exceeds expectations to all our guests since the hotel started operations in june 2007 we have received positive feedback in terms of service and facilities from our guests both local and international
1563646 then i didnt finish strong i kind of fumbled the exit there
1563647 it favors somebody who can hit it pretty darn far its wet so you have to hit your irons crisp
1563648 i didnt do as well as i hoped i could my irons were not that good today
1563649 ive been improving steadily since finishing 20th at the new englands
1563650 if my driving is good and i can hit the ball in the fairway like i did the first 14 holes im going to score pretty well
1563651 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1563652 the inflation fight probably will have to wait until 2009
1563653 conditions at this point do not seem to dictate an immediate tightening
1563654 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1563655 ive never seen anyone throw to first base with runners on first and second
1563656 if he gets a hit in his first at bat you know hes going to have a great day
1563657 the kids wanted to win this year they didnt talk about next year the mentality of this kids was to never say die
1563658 were only losing two or three players next year so everyone else is coming back and the expectation is to win a state championship
1563659 he had a streak of 50 scoreless innings so hats off to him he came back on short rest to advance us to the next round and i just cant say enough about my player slash coach
1563660 were at spring levels and people are underestimating the strength of the current
1563661 its statewide its dangerous because of the slippery conditions and strength of the current
1563662 if they had gone another 25 or 30 yards i dont know what would have happened
1563663 todos saben que el indec distorsiona las estad sticas desde enero de 2007 el gobierno ha destruido una instituci n que todav a tiene capital humano para funcionar con que repongan a los funcionarios honestos se podr salir adelante
1563664 est metida dentro de la econom a y que inexorablemente se va a poner de evidencia con virulencia en los pr ximos meses y a os
1563665 necesariamente la econom a ser recesiva por eso cuando antes se deje que aflore la crisis m s r pido se podr salir de este entuerto pero me temo que el gobierno siga postergando el sinceramiento de la cuesti n
1563666 es probable que haya aflorado en estos meses hasta el 20 por ciento
1563667 si impiden que se refleje la inflaci n aparece el desabastecimiento el gobierno ha querido evitar algo inevitable porque el enfriamiento de la econom a se va a producir porque no aument la capacidad productiva al ritmo de la demanda
1563668 el nivel socioecon mico e intelectual y el hecho de que vivan muchos profesionales en belgrano hace que la gente est m s concientizada a la hora de denunciar
1563669 el p blico es muy variado vienen j venes que en su gran mayor a presentan problemas con los prestadores de servicios de internet se oras mayores por cuestiones de electrodom sticos mal reparados y personas de todo tipo de edad en lo que tiene que ver con telefon a celular
1563670 desde diciembre de 2007 que ven a luchando con un comercio para que me lo reparasen correctamente o me cambiasen el artefacto y nunca consegu una soluci n me acerqu al centro contando la dificultad me asesoraron correctamente y por fin consegu la reposici n del electrodom stico
1563671 cada caso requiere un tiempo de an lisis y el trato es personalizado lo primero que se pide es una exposici n escrita con el motivo y el requerimiento que le hace a la empresa denunciada
1563672 he tenido una atenci n excelente y realmente me sent protegido sin que eso signifique una actitud contraria a la empresa el consumidor debe aprender a reclamar a trav s de estos procedimientos ya que se realizan con justicia y eficiencia
1563673 hemos organizado actividades en los distintos barrios para que los ciudadanos conozcan el servicio que ofrecemos en los cgpc y que sepan que existe una ley que los protege en su rol de consumidores de productos y servicios
1563674 efectividad del 75 en resoluci n de conflictos a favor del consumidor
1563675 todos llegan al final del caso hay muy pocas denuncias que resultan abandonadas en general todo lo cerramos en las audiencias conciliatorias
1563676 wie konnte das passieren was tut ihr gegen explodierende energiekosten gegen die steigenden hypothekenzinsen gegen die arbeitslosigkeit
1563677 if a landlord doesnt dot an i or cross a t in his eviction notice his case gets thrown out and he has to start over from scratch
1563678 they are not required to comply with the usual prerequisites of pleading and proof that apply to other civil cases in other words you get damages even if you dont prove them and not only that but the judge has no discretion if the statute is violated it doesnt matter
1563679 to actually think that any law that regulates a business would be totally against business people just doesnt make sense to me i think that the new hampshire laws are pretty well balanced these cases do move quickly
1563680 there are competing interests and there is a property interest of the tenant in their place there are due process issues
1563681 it strikes me that the landlord has to go through x number of procedures just to retain the right to his money that both sides admit he is owed
1563682 they wait a few months while the tenants say i am going to catch up i am going to catch up and then they are out a couple thousand dollars
1563683 then they have pay a couple thousand for an attorney
1563684 we try to get the word out to tenants that they cant fail to pay their rent
1563685 even if you have a case that you cant win you can sometimes still negotiate something that will give you much more time than waiting for a writ of possession to be issued
1563686 if you have a lawyer you are going to get advice that is going to help you keep your housing

1563689 the way people look dress and act reveals their attitudes and interests you can tell much about a societys ideas and values by observing the appearance and behavior of its people
1563690 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1563691 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1563692 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1563693 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
1563694 shutting down the strait closing down the persian gulf would be sort of a self defeating exercise
1563695 that doesnt say anything about whether we tolerate such a thing to happen
1563696 and given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1563697 we dont believe that now is the time for any parties to be acting in a provocative way
1563698 we believe that the violence should stop and all parties should begin a discussion so that they can move forward towards settling the situation
1563699 if events develop in the worst possible way with the use of force russia will not be able to stand by seeing as russian citizens live in south ossetia

1563704 oh but there will be a big party here when obama wins
1563705 we still have hope that he will bring electricity and build schools so the children have a good education maybe when hes president of america hell remember his roots and look after his community in kenya
1563706 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1563707 with billions of people living on just dollars a day around the world global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges and tragedies the international community faces
1563708 it must be a priority of american foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food shelter and clean drinking water as we strive to rebuild americas standing in the world this important bill will demonstrate our promise and commitment to those in the developing world our commitment to the global economy must extend beyond trade agreements that are more about increasing corporate profits than about helping workers and small farmers everywhere i commend chairman biden and ranking member lugar for supporting this bill and moving it forward quickly
1563709 poverty hunger and disease will be among the most serious challenges confronting the world in the 21st century
1563710 this legislation provides the president of the united states the framework and resources to help implement a comprehensive policy to reduce global poverty it is the human condition that has always driven the great events of history this is a responsibility of all citizens of the world
1563711 global poverty directly impacts our national security we must rally private sector and government resources to eliminate extreme global poverty and to fight global disease
1563712 with more than 1 1 billion men women and children throughout the world living on less than 1 a day it is of the utmost importance to make sure these people get the help they need and push for sustainable economic growth we need to do more to save lives in the poorest countries and extend our hand to people in need
1563713 global poverty is one of the greatest moral and security challenges facing the world today nearly 2 7 billion people live on less than 2 a day and close to a billion live on less than 1 a day this bill represents a major advance in our effort to address global poverty after introducing this measure in the house for the past several years i am pleased to see the senate foreign relations committee take significant steps toward its final passage
1563714 the agitators job according to alinsky is first to bring folks to the
1563715 he embodied the desperate young naif coddled and privileged by white family members but due to his errant kenyan father who flew the coop lacking masculine authority and identity
1563716 there arent that many guys like that that come down the pipe with that ability that he has to hit
1563717 i dont want the pollster to think i am a racist effect
1563718 republicans and democrats have spent like drunken sailors and its been disgraceful
1563719 maybe we should meet face to face at that sushi restaurant ill give you a piece of my mind and kick a piece of your a f ing bastard
1563720 it appears as if there is a fear that if this is honestly discussed people will hate all illegal immigrants so there is silence but in being silent about the rapes and murders it is as if the victims never even existed
1563721 the guy is how do i put this really freaking weird and we like weird a lot here is romes take
1563722 i dont want the pollster to think i am racist
1563723 i have said i do not believe senator obama shares reverend wrights extreme views
1563724 but let me also be clear reverend hagee was not and is not my pastor or spiritual adviser and i did not attend his church for 20 years
1563725 and you know they said some pretty rough things about me too but you know this is a contact sport if you dont want to play keep your uniform off
1563726 1 when don imus makes a bad joke out comes sharkton jackson spike lee whoopi goldberg the naacp and n o w to demand his firing and subject us all to over a weeks lecture on race when jesse jackson uses the n word where is the outrage
1563727 ludicras just composed an offensive rap song for obama as monica pointed out on tgm why didnt obama confront ludicras directly about writing offensive rap music is there a different standard for what don imus can say versus what ludicras can say oh and have sharkton jackson spike lee whoopi goldberg the naacp and n o w commented on that song yet
1563728 im watching the round table with george stephenopolus and they are discussing mccains moses ad
1563729 so i am here right now because i am married to the only person in this race who has a chance of healing this nation
1563730 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1563731 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1563732 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1563733 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
1563734 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
1563735 we dont want to cause any damage to obamas campaign
1563736 not just the people in gaza but people from all over the world are rooting for this great man
1563737 i am not familiar with the particulars of the case so i am commenting in general the fec will have to examine all the circumstances before determining any wrongdoing
1563738 the abject silence on the part of the canadian arab federation in the face of vitriolic attacks on jews by muslim perpetrators is tantamount to tacit approval of anti semitism and gives a green light to others who would entertain the notion of attacking jews
1563739 taj approached the group of teenagers around 10 45 pm and asked whos jewish
1563740 he then slapped her in the face and pullled her hair before her friends jessica motta kayla hungle and daniel ball attempted to intervene
1563741 the canadian arab federation has not only not uttered one word of condemnation for this horrific attack but they have remained silent in the face of arson attacks in canada directed against shuls and jewish community centers and violent attacks on jewish students on local university campuses
1563742 a jewish camp in northern ontario was attacked no one was hurt but property was smashed and tires slashed sending a clear message the camp staff was told by the town that jews were no longer welcome in their stores
1563743 jewish businesses in canada are picketed by groups supported by the caf claiming these businesses support israeli apartheid
1563744 making a strong case that it is every bit as radical and unhinged
1563745 recent sponsorship of an essay contest on the ethnic cleansing of palestine in which it urged high school students to channel the groups own fervid hatred of israel for prizes
1563746 under the guise of islamophobia the caf is promulgating hatred for jews in a fashion similar to that of the nazis during world war ii just as the nazis accused worldwide jewry of maintaining a secret cabal with the intent of dominating and oppressing the poor and downtrodden germans so too is the caf actively working to promote the fallacious and patently ridiculous claim that the jews run the world while muslims represent a powerless minority even though there are 1 4 billion muslims in the world and only 13 5 million jews
1563747 a fully paid up member of the anglo saxon mafia
1563748 muhammed is the messenger of allah and those who are with him are harsh towards the kuffar and compassionate towards each other
1563749 it is the ideology of the muslim brotherhood that justifies and promotes attacks on jews in canada
1563750 some kind of form must be signed that prohibits entry into canada of people that believe in the muslim brotherhood ideology this would make it possible to conduct denaturalization and deportation proceedings
1563751 our major concern is the safety of jews in our community and to that end we the jdl are offering security training to the community we will not just train anyone the jdl is not seeking a confrontation with adversarial forces but because of the level of violence and intimidation against the jewish community it is important to teach jews how to defend themselves should a situation arise

1563771 the parliamentary liberal party has elected colin barnett as its leader
1563772 the election was for one nomination only and was unopposed
1563773 the people got up and looked around and saw the mountain lions tail leaving the house
1563774 i was egg shell walking where i could only put light pressure on the ground
1563775 there was no pain whatsoever and within two weeks i felt good
1563776 it paves the way for exciting new research for stem cell therapy we can do in australia
1563777 i would have thought mr ngo should be the first witness
1563778 ill direct that steps be taken to bring him to sydney
1563779 restrict supply to genuine cases of treatment of short term pain
1563780 the adverse side effects and problems happen over a long period of time not usually in short treatment bursts so limiting pack sizes would be the way to go
1563781 and we look forward to having the issue investigated further to understand the situation more thoroughly

1563791 oh yes and god help america return to your truth
1563792 ill tell you what nobody would ever have enslaved me never they all went along with it cowards
1563793 here comes the orator with his flood of words and his drop of reason
1563794 is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death
1563795 for a variety of reasons internal growth of the slave population was not enough to fulfill the demand in muslim society this resulted in massive importation which involved enormous suffering and loss of life from the capture and transportation of slaves from non muslim lands in theory slavery in islamic law does not have a racial or color component although this has not always been the case in practice the arab slave trade was most active in west asia north africa and east africa slavery claiming the sanction of islam is documented presently in the african republics of chad mauritania niger mali and sudan
1563796 because i wanted to own that which once owned me
1563797 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1563798 we have come to express our gratitude and appreciation for the sacrifices made by these great warriors soldiers in freeing the iraqi people and in helping us in iraq recover from tyranny and dictatorship
1563799 did you know a negro who bought his freedom bought other negros who were slaves
1563800 no the children are not guilty for the sins of their fathers so why should i pay for your ancestors arrogance by owning slaves
1563801 you can pay if you like but i dont think your indigence reaches your wallet does it
1563802 i would endorse a certificate from the government offically apologizing to those who were slaves and granting them full if belated citizenship on them suitable for framing
1563803 unfortunately obama does not qualify for either reparations or certification since his ancestors were never slaves in this country
1563804 it perplexes me why if its so terrible here that blacks dont want to return to the homeland like the jews did
1563805 even now i struggle and its one day at a time
1563806 during a recent overseas jet fuel binge thousands of dollars of the stuff just went up in smoke i was seeing those trails dude and i thought that aint right barry you need help

1563808 its not that liberals dont know anything its just that they know so much that isnt true
1563809 i dont have any respect for the religious right there is no place in this country for practicing religion in politics that goes for falwell robertson and all the rest of these political preachers they are a detriment to the country
1563810 a lot of so called conservatives dont know what the word means they think ive turned liberal because i believe a woman has a right to an abortion thats a decision thats up to the pregnant woman not up to the pope or some do gooders or the religious right
1563811 by maintaining the separation of church and state the united states has avoided the intolerance which has so divided the rest of the world with religious wars can any of us refute the wisdom of madison and the other framers can anyone look at the carnage in iran the bloodshed in northern ireland or the bombs bursting in lebanon and yet question the dangers of injecting religious issues into the affairs of state
1563812 the religious factions will go on imposing their will on others unless the decent people connected to them recognize that religion has no place in public policy they must learn to make their views known without trying to make their views the only alternatives we have succeeded for 205 years in keeping the affairs of state separate from the uncompromising idealism of religious groups and we mustnt stop now
1563813 to retreat from that separation would violate the principles of conservatism and the values upon which the framers built this democratic republic
1563814 in our country the lie has become not just a moral category but a pillar of the state
1563815 i find it interesting that supposedly liberal open minded and understanding parents would actually propagandize their own children to hate potus conservatives or anyone who votes republican from time to time
1563816 the president shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states

1563820 overall finance approvals are now down a quarter since its peak earlier in the year
1563821 this obviously has been a key part of the reserve bank thinking
1563822 they would have had this data on hand with their decision yesterday
1563823 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1563824 falls in approvals are on a par with previous cycles
1563825 but it is much more concentrated in purchase for established dwellings
1563826 to have a 25 per cent fall in finance approvals in five months would have them a little bit worried
1563827 the deceleration is much more abrupt than they would like
1563828 as a leading indicator of building approvals and commencements the series suggest further weakness with housing likely to detract from activity in 2008 and into 2009
1563829 the construction sector is one of the largest employers accounting for around 10 per cent of total employment with the related property amp business services accounting for 12 per cent of total employment
1563830 todays data are supportive of the rbas newly adopted easing bias
1563831 we have continued to cooperate with the police and the sheriffs department has now released information that the other vehicle ran the red light while striking shias truck
1563832 if you dont know what your passion is realize that one reason for your existence on earth is to find it
1563833 if you make a choice that doesnt please your mate friends or whoever the world will not fall apart
1563834 what the fuck were they smoking to think of that
1563835 damage to civilian structures and interests invariably described by briefers during the war as collateral and unintended was sometimes neither
1563836 if i had to do it over again i would do exactly the same thing
1563837 we wouldnt work with dmx period if we didnt believe he was just a victim of circumstance
1563838 the sheriff in phoenix is definitely targeting him its unbelievable
1563839 ive seen some reports on it that make it out to be something more than it is
1563840 well youre close but there are these two moments that you should focus on in terms of length
1563841 maybe you can work with the sounds in it or something
1563842 i feel like ive gone as far as im comfortable going lets take it to the next stage

1563847 thats why we say particularly because of this incident but this incident has brought to a head simmering problems in this area for a long time
1563848 it is all about another important step in making transport better for the people of nsw
1563849 i make it perfectly clear this road opening today is evidence of the work that the nsw government is putting in to assist us in the south west sector

1563854 its a show me story and weve yet to perform we know that
1563855 some theme parks held up in the last recession but this is a different downturn so you cant necessarily say they will hold up during this one
1563856 its just whether we have enough money so i need to make recognizable progress this year
1563857 there are too many yellow flags like weather or the broader economy to guarantee it
1563858 but if current trends continue then we can get there
1563859 the cost of filling up would never have crossed my mind in the past

1563874 i first saw the pit viper in dallas and instantly fell in love
1563875 brook phillips and his team at tpi have taken great care of me and theyre just a phone call away if i have any questions the pit viper which i named serena is especially popular at our training facility in valley ranch were holding a contest on the dallas cowboys web site where fans can watch a video and vote for their favorite custom car driven by a player

1563878 through the end of the second quarter our parks entertained 7 6 million visitors average in park guest per capita spending was 40 45 and out of park revenues totaled 40 5 million
1563879 this compares with attendance of 6 7 million average in park guest per capita spending of 40 68 and out of park revenues of 38 3 million through the second quarter of 2007
1563880 thats not all bad when you consider the economic turndown were in
1563881 being able to maintain the market share is certainly a benefit
1563882 were still not seeing a lot of encouraging news but we are seeing oil prices relax a little bit gasolines going down so i think people are starting to spend a little more
1563883 were seeing a little more resilience in our industry than we anticipated
1563884 this is due primarily to soft early season attendance at two of our largest parks cedar point and knotts berry farm
1563885 we previously had some worries about cedar fair but this positive report has abated some of our concerns
1563886 many families have been cutting back on discretionary spending but the company has done a good job at keeping its local foot traffic consistent
1563887 if you were to build an entertainment company from scratch today you wouldnt even question that games should be in it

1563950 market conditions for the industry remain very difficult on the back of high oil prices and a weak economic environment
1563951 long haul premium remains broadly flat versus last year while non premium bookings remain most sensitive to price changes
1563952 roughly half of bas revenues come from premium tickets so it is a very important profit generator particularly with the current economic weakness and plummeting consumer confidence

1563958 and im going to put forward legislation to do just that
1563959 the thing that really impresses me is how well organized they are
1563960 it started with a structure and it very quickly moved in to the trees they got on it right away
1563961 we were doing some dirt work over here and a friend of ours owns this house so we brought the water truck over and if theres any spotting or any flames in the grass well put that out
1563962 weve been using what we can in a small room above one of saddams old hangars

1563976 even a fool when he holds his peace is considered wise when he closes his lips he is esteemed a man of understanding
1563977 furthermore it has been said whoever divorces his wife let him give her a certificate of divorce but i say to you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery
1563978 the pharisees also came to him testing him and saying to him
1563979 have you not read that he who made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh so then they are no longer two but one flesh therefore what god has joined together let not man separate
1563980 why then did moses command to give a certificate of divorce and to put her away
1563981 moses because of the hardness of your hearts permitted you to divorce your wives but from the beginning it was not so and i say to you whoever divorces his wife except for sexual immorality and marries another commits adultery and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery
1563982 if such is the case of the man with his wife it is better not to marry
1563983 all cannot accept this saying but only those to whom it has been given for there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mothers womb and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake he who is able to accept it let him accept it
1563984 now concerning the things of which you wrote to me it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless because of sexual immorality let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband let the husband render to his wife the affection due her and likewise also the wife to her husband
1563985 but i say to the unmarried and to the widows it is good for them if they remain even as i am but if they cannot exercise self control let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn with passion now to the married i command yet not i but the lord a wife is not to depart from her husband but even if she does depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and a husband is not to divorce his wife
1563986 marriage is honorable among all and the bed undefiled but fornicators and adulterers god will judge
1563987 to every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace

1564070 saddam is not like the saudi princes who spend the bulk of their lives outside of their country and who fritter away the kingdoms oil profits on prostitutes and bottles of champagne in paris no saddam is building railways creating electrical networks highways and other important elements of a serious state infrastructure after eights years of war against the iranian regime of khomeini he desperately needs to demobilize his republican guard which incorporates so many of this technical elite in order to rebuild his war devastated country these people are his technicians his engineers if they are put to work in the way saddam wishes they will rapidly make iraq the most advanced power in the region and we cannot allow this to happen
1564071 now we can see a new world coming into view a world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order
1564072 are these medical need cases from the military bases bush has put in the caspian basin area or combat related injuries
1564073 they are both need for general medical treatment and combat related vehicle accidents non combat injuries major illness combat injuries etc
1564074 interesting i do not seem to recall reading in the news that the us is involved in combat operations in those nations are we talking about black ops
1564075 yes it is almost all black ops in those nations
1564076 how did you know that these troops had been injured in those nations and not say in afghanistan
1564077 because they were angry at what they had been sent to do and they wanted someone to talk to about it as their care providers safe in the hospital late at night they cried they talked they confessed to us what they had been sent to do we are all under orders to shut up not tell the truth but soldier to soldier we talked a lot i heard more than i was prepared to hear due to the horrid extent of the injuries i saw more than i was prepared to see
1564078 why would a tough special ops soldier be crying loss of a fellow soldier loss of a leg or limb or god forbid his genitals or face unrecognizable anymore
1564079 because of what they were sent to do once they figured out what the real mission was
1564080 no they were sent to be the terrorists and it is why they were sent that had them crying some of them were afraid that god would never forgive them and i think they might be right at times there were some attacks on the us soldiers by people who do not want us there and some pay back attacks after us forces had attacked them but for the most part what i was being told about was the us conducting intimidation and terrorism operations against civilians to get their oil and gas
1564081 many of the people in those areas do not like america do not trust america many are competing to get control of areas of land that have or are thought to have vast amounts of oil or natural gas some of it is oil and gas leases some of it pipeline right of way to get it to a port and ship it all over the world
1564082 i know the caspian basin mother lode the idiotic grand chessboard that is why i have been reporting on and researching the caspian basin and the real reasons we attacked afghanistan to steal a pipeline deal from an argentina company have these soldiers been sent in to strong arm threaten terrorize etc with these big oil thugs and things got too hot shooting started
1564083 some times yes but that is not what had many of them upset unless they did lose a fellow soldier or yes they lost a future because of their injuries
1564084 exactly and that is exactly why i contacted you japan china russia and others are over there to sign up the oil and gas leases but the us is the only one i know of that is going in there and terrorizing or killing people to get its way they are using us soldiers to try to force people to sign a contract or kill them and take it from them anyway the truth has to get out about what bush has done and used 9 11 as the excuse to do it these black ops started way before 9 11 they had to get oil and gas leases signed then they had to get the pipeline under control
1564085 many of our soldiers have already figured out that 9 11 was just to get the pipeline they need across afghanistan many of these soldiers know they were used to get the oil and gas leases nailed down so there would be something to put through that pipeline
1564086 the us army or marines cannot tell you the truth lest they want to face court martial and spend the rest of their life in leavenworth as for me i am no longer concerned about making grade to colonel or general i am resigning my commission and getting out of this web of lies and evil i can no longer serve this nation and what it really stands for and what is does and will not tell america im finished
1564087 were you able to determine from any of these special ops soldiers how long such covert operations had been going on prior to 9 11
1564088 yes according to some of them these operations had been going on for up to a year before 9 11 and possibly even longer they had to nail down those oil and gas leases pipeline right of ways because many other nations were after the same oil and gas deals
1564089 the thought just occurred to me how do they explain these injuries or kia of these soldiers who are waging black ops against civilians in nations we supposedly have no ongoing military operations
1564090 afghanistan some times if after october 7 2001 or they list them as victims of terrorists without explaining that they were killed or injured conducting acts of terrorism against civilians and a fire fight broke out innocent humans except they were sitting on land with oil and gas under it there were some attacks on us troops as pay back
1564091 did any of these soldiers admit to you how they figured out that someone had ordered them on an illegal mission an illegal order to go process a death warrant on civilians who would not sign a contract
1564092 in april 2001 tommy franks the commander of us forces in the persian gulf south asia area testifies to congress in april that his commands key mission is
1564093 the black ops the acts of intimidation and us terrorism and slaughter started well before 9 11

1564101 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves

1564118 they were taking pitches and taking good swings i was in the same sequence on every batter hard soft hard soft that wont happen again
1564119 they hit some two strike pitches over the heart of the plate that usually are on the corners
1564120 he kept us in the game and thats whats important
1564121 one pitch different and he probably would have won the game but otherwise you cant ask for much more
1564122 i want to get in there a little more than i was overall i felt comfortable and calm and just tried to hit the glove as much as i could once again i worked from behind and it ended up hurting me a few times

1564124 being canadian i always watched major league baseball games watching for canadians looking for canadians cheering them on
1564125 its just i feel very proud to be canadian to get here its a tougher road for canadians we dont have all the access of baseball in america with high school and all that its a little bit more of a struggle especially in the baseball world everybody embraces that person that made it and cheers them on and hopes for the best im just really happy i can be one of those guys that people can cheer for

1564128 even though we werent hitting the ball all game long the jays knew if we kept it close we could give ourselves a shot at the end its a big win for us
1564129 of course the future careers of the three players was discussed it was canvassed
1564130 im not going to sit here and talk rubbish to you of course it was discussed
1564131 at the end of our playing campaign the three boys careers will be assessed again
1564132 could those players be traded yes we will review that at the end of the season but were not sitting down as a club right at the moment going who are we going to trade we dont do that until the end of the year

1564134 it was decided by the leadership group and the executive that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper
1564135 we feel that the integrity of this football club and that the policies of honesty and integrity that we build the whole organisation on if thats robbed or taken away or diminished in any way shape or form then youre striking at the very essence or core of your existence you might as well turn the lights off and go home
1564136 i dont accept that at all but i do accept that people will be looking at the collingwood football club and asking questions
1564137 but during the period that he had those boundaries in place we had an individual focused on his footy living within those parameters and his life and his footy was at a peak in a lot of ways we actually started to turn him around

1564141 the methodical and calculated steps these extremists took showed blatant disregard for the safety and welfare of our community

1564158 theyve set a challenge for us in london no question about it
1564159 it will be a tough task to meet the quality weve seen here in beijing were up for it
1564160 we do have a very strong team better financed and better resourced than ever and i believe this will deliver the goods and we will move significantly forward from tenth but it would be unwise to speculate how close we will get to fourth
1564161 clean athletes are the very heart of the olympic ideal
1564162 what we want is competitions between athletes not between laboratories we have to have the funding to fight doping to be ahead of the game to be able to detect the illicit products gene doping is a tremendous threat in the future
1564163 the more we test the better it is for our sport
1564164 its essential for our sport which has had some issues with doping
1564165 but the riders are starting to self police themselves starting to point the finger at people they suspect for a sport like ours thats quite a shift on 20 years ago if that takes hold it will be stronger than any anti doping measure

1564491 we express our strong discontent and firm opposition to the resolution which linked such irrelevant issues as human rights religious freedom sudans darfur issue and the myanmar issue with the beijing olympics and criticized the chinese government groundlessly
1564492 the passing of the resolution at this time has fully exposed the attempt of the very few anti china us lawmakers to politicize the olympics and their evil intention to disrupt and sabotage the beijing olympic games
1564493 such a deed has violated the olympic spirit and aim and also violated the common wish of the world people including the us people
1564494 we have the confidence and ability to make the beijing olympic games a world sports event with distinctive characteristics and a high level the attempt of the us congress anti china forces will gain no popularity and be doomed to failure
1564495 such a deed itself is blasphemy to the olympic spirit and is against the common wishes of people all around the world including people of the united states

1564536 if a chimney were to be built it would be significantly lower than the current one at our lawford road plant
1564537 should we decide to lodge a planning application for either site there would then be a full public consultation
1564538 at this stage we do not know what technology we will use if the plant gets built
1564539 it may have a chimney but there is another option to built a plant without one if we submit a planning application you will find out
1564540 but if it did get built the main percentage of emissions would be harmless water vapour

1564566 it picked up a little bit after the last snow
1564567 they come in and say i hit a pothole every year around this time we get the same things
1564568 we must have had prior knowledge ignored it and didnt do anything about it
1564569 you just have to be careful drive slower and avoid them at all costs
1564570 if the path to hell is paved with good intentions then the path to heaven is paved with honest attempts
1564571 there are many people who believe that angels are out in the air somewhere but if they are out there we cannot see them there is no such thing as formless spirits flying around out there somewhere in space unless it is righteous minds
1564572 i am not going to do it nor will others with me and behind me and coming in with me to help me you call them angels there in the bible they are angels in the way of understanding they are with me here in america to help bring this about and to help save you they are not to come but there are already 10 000 here in america right now
1564573 and the angel malawk of yhwh lord said unto her
1564574 and saith unto him if thou be the son of god thehos cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels angelos charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up least at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone
1564575 yeah while i was speaking in prayer even the man eesh gabriel whom i had seen in a vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening obligation
1564576 a human being or mortal man with skin in all respects
1564577 angels were originally in the jewish theology considered simply a messenger of god as the name malachim imports
1564578 the angel that the prophet saw flying in the midst of heaven is not to be mistaken as a spirit being for allah has taught me that this angel is a human being flying in an airplane with a mission to give the people the last warning which will be in small pamphlet form these pamphlets will be written or printed in two languages arabic and english and they will be dropped from a terrific height over america the only country that the revelation is directed to
1564579 its great i want it back i want the records back

1564587 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1564588 hes the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
1564589 she got it that the mccain thing was a low blow
1564590 and she felt she didnt want to return it with angry fire and that this was the best way to respond its a playful jab
1564591 shes a lot smarter than people give her credit for
1564592 you can tell our country has its eyes on the prize when paris hilton is getting into one of the most important presidential election campaigns in years
1564593 i just think mccain is appealing to the lowest basest parts of people in this country its cheap stuff
1564594 for this guy to be putting out campaign ads with paris hilton and britney spears is just absolutely ludicrous and insulting to voters
1564595 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1564596 a gap continues to exist between familiarity with ict and translating this into effective teaching
1564597 we must not diminish the motivation for individual schools to find better teaching methods using ict but at the same time we should address the unevenness in the quality of execution across schools
1564598 im okay with being in the army but i dont want to go to iraq i dont believe in it

1564601 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
1564602 my understanding that the iraiq parliament did not convene on sunday however it has not yet recessed and lawmakers remain ready to reconvene once a new bill is ready for them to consider the iraqi political leaders are continuing to discuss the elections law ambassador crocker and us embassy officials continue to encourage iraqis to work towards compromise and consensus and to develop an elections law that will allow for provincial elections this year
1564603 after the long talks we held it was clear for us that what happened on july 22 was a big conspiracy and very dangerous for the democratic and constitutional process of iraq in particular against the kurds
1564604 a walkout by kurdish lawmakers over how to deal with the disputed oil city of kirkuk
1564605 we cannot have a vote with an absence of a whole faction the vote is useless it will be rejected by the represenatives of this bloc and by the presidency council
1564606 many observers believe talabani would stand with his kurdish compatriots and vote against the measure bringing it back to square one
1564607 the draft of the provinical elections law will be referred to the presidential council which will definitely not approve it so the elections will be postponed until next year
1564608 a vote had been planned for sunday but it was scrapped when lawmakers failed to agree on how the elections would affect kirkuk which minority kurds want to make part of their semi autonomous northern region turkeys nationalist movement party mhp leader devlet bahceli called on the countrys ruling justice and development party akp in a written statement to warn iraqi kurdish groups in kirkuk more openly and take the necessary measures in order to protect turkmens rights turkey who has historical ties with kirkuk has been monitoring the situation very closely and calls on all parties to reach consensus for a solution
1564609 i think we said something about that last week i believe and our position is that we believe that this now is not the time to be making such a decision we believe that the parties need to leave themselves open to all appropriate or all options in order to come to an understanding so that they can proceed with provincial elections this fall
1564610 the iraqi parliament adjourned its tuesday session without reaching an agreement on provisions in the election law regarding the status of the city of kirkuk shahied al jaberi with the shiite united iraqi alliance said lawmakers opted to postpone the issue until the wednesday session because lawmakers could not agree on the kirkuk issue voices of iraq reported
1564611 elections in kirkuk would also be postponed until no later than december 2009
1564612 a turkmen representative said a delay in kirkuk voting was unacceptable
1564613 the parliament session to approve the provincial election law has been delayed until tomorrow
1564614 the deadlock also prevented a vote by parliament on a 21 billion supplemental budget the crisis has marked the first time that elements of one of the most prominent shiite muslim parties the supreme islamic iraqi council have broken with the kurds their traditional allies
1564615 the book alleges that habbush saddams intelligence chief was in cia protective custody after the 2003 invasion that the white house ordered cia officials to have tahir jalil habbush al tikriti write and backdate the letter and paid him 5 million the author quotes two former cia officials who claim to have seen a draft of the letter on white house stationery

1564619 under the fixed withdrawal scheme combat troops are to be withdrawn but sufficient forces are to remain to protect the american embassy fight a resumption of al qaeda and contribute to the defence against outside intervention but such tasks require combat not support forces and the foreseeable controversy about the elusive distinction will distract from the overall diplomatic goal

1564621 two reversals of positions he has taken in the past
1564622 in another switch obama calls for tapping u s oil reserve
1564623 obamas revised position on a key energy issue was his second shift in three days
1564624 had met with economic advisers and business leaders in washington last week and they had advised him to call for tapping the government reserve
1564625 team obama cast the proposal as a refinement rather than a flip flop on obamas previous opposition to tapping the 770 million barrel reserve
1564626 energy policy is offering more flip flops than a lake tahoe souvenir stand
1564627 one more week one more barack obama reversal on a key issue actually make that two reversals so much for principles

1564641 i deal with anything that has to do with family in particular anything that helps families make consumer choices
1564642 food safety and food preservation thats where extension has its niche
1564643 some days you come in and do planning for programs or you might come in and some major thing has happened and youve got calls coming in like when the powers out and people are calling to see if its still safe to keep their food
1564644 she understands how easy it is to slip away from an exercise routine
1564645 we do things like set up fruits and vegetable stations and let kids try fruits and vegetables they may have never had
1564646 we had three classes on food safety in one we did the glow germ activity we put orange lotion on their hands then had them wash their hands then we used a black light to show them what areas they missed washing
1564647 janelle saw the need to teach nutrition in the schools and she got the grant for that

1564657 whether these helpful hints have been passed down the generations or we figure them out for ourselves every woman has her own arsenal of them
1564658 why take stain removal advice from a woman who hasnt done her own laundry in years when you can get it from a woman who does laundry every day of the week
1564659 thank goodness my mother is still around for me to call embarrassingly often to ask how to roast a chicken

1564668 some kids need more enrichment activities and other kids are over enriched

1564744 i did yoga for the first time in my life this morning me likes
1564745 im bloody confused for the whole day today this unexplainable sense of emptiness has been weighing down on me and no matter how much i tried to make sense of it i find my mind settling on either the image of him or things that are related to him one way or the other

1564752 its hard to explain but somehow the knowledge of liking him fills me with an unknown sense of completeness and that is not something i get on a frequent basis
1564753 sometimes i laugh at my own stupidity at how i know for a fact that my feelings for him will never amount to anything even given a hundred years but yet i still mindlessly plunge head first into it but never can something like that be explained with words and logic alone
1564754 but as a fore note i can safely declare that i will never regret liking him
1564755 in this lifetime things were just not meant to be and i dont blame anyone the reassuring thought of knowing him and having him as a friend is something that was second to none
1564756 and i am glad that at least i know him

1564775 having said that this the western lowland gorillas remains a unique find i dont know if well ever find something on this scale again

1564796 the real obama fundamentally he is a big government redistributionist
1564797 what they portray is a barack obama sharply at variance with the image of the post racial post ideological bipartisan culture war shunning politician familiar from current media coverage and purveyed by the obama campaign as details of obamas early political career emerge into the light his associations with such radical figures as reverend jeremiah wright father michael pfleger reverend james meeks bill ayers and bernardine dohrn look less like peculiar instances of personal misjudgment and more like intentional political partnerships at his core in other words the politician chronicled here is profoundly race conscious exceedingly liberal free spending even in the face of looming state budget deficits and partisan elected president this man would presumably shift the country sharply to the left on all the key issues of the day culture war issues included its no wonder obama has passed over his springfield years in relative silence

1564900 both sides agreed that there was a need for the two governments to engage on all issues across the board with a view to developing a common strategy to overcome the challenges posed to the security and stability of both countries by terrorism and extremism
1564901 the two sides agreed to coordinate their efforts to stop cross border terrorism
1564902 at the suggestion of pakistan the afghan side agreed to re engage on all bilateral and multilateral forums
1564903 the aim of raw is to keep internal disturbances flaring up and the isi preoccupied so that pakistan can lend no worthwhile resistance to indian designs in the region
1564904 its not just about the sport its about the image of china
1564905 chairman mao would have been happy if he were here today
1564906 it is frustrating to find that that kind of planned cheating is going on
1564907 the badgers hold on the no 2 spot is a bit shaky lance smiths dismissal provides one less option out of the backfield though wisconsin remains very strong in the run game the key here is health particularly along the defensive line and in the secondary can allan evridge finally separate himself in the quarterback competition well find out soon enough
1564908 who do you think is most concerned about the long term future of the green bay packers brett favre and his supporters or general manager ted thompson and his coach mike mccarthy
1564909 do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of him
1564910 i would rather win than anything else maybe they should have asked if thompson mccarthy care about that the answer is obviously no
1564911 at least green bay will get a higher draft pick next year just like tt wants what a farce at least the ar era will be very short in green bay same as the managements future when they show what they can do
1564912 the packers will release you over ted thompsons dead body theyre not going to give you the chance to run through the tunnel opening night as a viking
1564913 it should always be about the kingdom not the king
1564914 now you guys have finally gotten a taste of what weve been dealing with the past few years brett favre cant make up his mind ted thompson and i decided after we both got contract extensions that now is the time to quit kissing bretts in the hopes that hed just go away and so he went away and we moved on and now he wants to dictate where hes going to play and he used the possibility of forcing his way back onto the packers as a way to get what he wants were not going to release him but well do everything we can to trade him to a team thats not in the nfc north
1564915 di dunia nih tidak ada apa yang kita punyai semuanya pinjaman semata mata
1564916 ambil contoh duit kita dalam bank tu sapa yang punya kita punya belom tentu kalau kita mati waris yang punya kita tolong simpan je

1564918 wahai bumi kau berkhidmatlah kepada hambaku yang berkhidmat kepadaku dan kau khadamkanlah hambaku yang berkhidmat untuk engkau
1564919 maybe they should have shot the piano player hardy har
1564920 i knew id like it here but i didnt know id like it this much
1564921 a lot of these guys are going to be around for a while and ill be one of them i just couldnt be happier
1564922 i didnt realize what an intense competitor he is and what a big game pitcher he is
1564923 the better the opponent the tougher the game the more excited he is about pitching
1564924 hes behind but well work to get him up to speed and we know hes the kind of player who will get himself caught up
1564925 right from the start through the draft and minicamps he has shown us things that are innate to successful nfl linebackers
1564926 i want to catch up quick on what i missed and move forward as fast as i can
1564927 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1564928 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1564929 you dont want to jeopardize their long term health and were talking about a 22 year old kid here
1564930 he can outbox most of these guys when he boxes hes hard to hit which means that hes going to hit and not be hit that is what we want
1564931 i watched my father sacrifice a lot to make sure i was at the gym on time
1564932 hed stay up until 3 4 in the morning working with me on certain combinations i watched my mother sacrifice working when we needed money for trips just to have them here is a way for me to thank them
1564933 everybody wanted to be around my father and boxing my three younger brothers would hide in the back of the car so they wouldnt be left behind when wed head off to the gym
1564934 we made a deal that when we had boys he could name them
1564935 i can knock the guy out and hell still find something that i was doing wrong and hell try to correct it
1564936 we try to keep the gym separated when were home
1564937 as a result of that i was ostracized by the kids in my neighborhood
1564938 i was amazed at how well little gary boxed at such a young age
1564939 his strengths are his hand speed his balance having a very good eye at seeing punches coming and not get hit hes very accurate when he throws his punches
1564940 a lot of people dont know hes a very spiritual person
1564941 i guess you would see wireless networking as almost inherently more promiscuous so to speak than regular networks
1564942 to maintain a good order of reporting activities at the square journalists are advised to make telephone appointments with the administration committee of the tiananmen area
1564943 priority of entry would be given to journalists with appointments guide service would also be provided
1564944 we all take a lot of pride in china my hope is that the olympics will help the world understand this country
1564945 im not even scratching the surface of being able to react right now im still out there thinking im sure as camp goes on ill become more comfortable in the scheme and be able to react more quickly
1564946 you can have 10 or 11 checks on one play just recognizing formations and all the shifts that go on is pretty difficult im far from there im still trying to learn from the old guys
1564947 the physical abilities of all three of them are obvious
1564948 the speed of mayo the quickness of guyton crables length those are physical attributes but the thing i like is their attitude they are willing to accept the many things that we are asking them to do
1564949 chris slade helped me a lot willie mcginest those are two guys i leaned on those are two guys whose pads i carried off the field
1564950 that really broke me in i tell those guys that 13 years ago i was doing that too
1564951 im just trying to learn as much as i can
1564952 its a true blessing to have the older guys like that be able to help you and like ive said since day one im just trying to be a sponge and learn as much as i can
1564953 coach meidt turned to me and said you were pretty horrible when it came to technique but you made up for it with some good throws
1564954 we had a couple of fortunate catches or i should say risky throws and very fortunate catches when you watch video again
1564955 colt brennan had a couple of plays where they could have gone either way those are things he can learn from
1564956 he has to become a more disciplined quarterback not risk as much as he risks in the game this week it turned out great for us a great performance but it could easily have been the other way
1564957 what he was was very accurate in his throws i thought his decision making was average
1564958 its just a mixed bag and when he sees the video and we make the corrections he will improve
1564959 at the movie theater i saw a kid in a brennan jersey
1564960 they are very interested in learning about me my successful story in the united states and also my superstar shawn
1564961 if he believes i can do it if he thinks its the best for me then i have nothing to stop me from believing that
1564962 its just the best feeling ever to know that you have someone there who respects you so much that you can trust them to that level
1564963 some of my relatives are still there theyre so ready to cheer us on theyre so excited to see us coming back
1564964 i want to show their country that the coaches hard work is shown through me
1564965 i want to prove that they are just as successful and amazing as they were when they left
1564966 he was a role model he was working so hard he always had a smiling face
1564967 to have a girl like shawn be in your neighborhood its kind of a once in a lifetime thing especially in the state of iowa where the population is small and theres no high school gymnastics theres just a limited number of clubs
1564968 if you cant do it they kick you out the door they dont deal with keeping people happy
1564969 i dont think youll find many athletes in the history of the sport thats all around the world who practice like that
1564970 i guarantee you theyre in the gym 40 hours a week
1564971 he always figures out when to push and when to take a step back shes always able to perform the best whenever the most important competitions are coming up
1564972 when you are focused the way athletes only like michael phelps and shawn johnson are you reduce the risk for injury
1564973 in our little town shes a huge star but shes like a normal kid helping other kids moving equipment moving the mats all the little things other kids are doing shes doing theres no exceptions
1564974 i didnt understand the concept that people were coming out to help shawn johnson train or get back in her gym
1564975 i didnt see the reason for anybody to do that
1564976 we have been working together since she was 6 years old a toothless little girl
1564977 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past all of the things that have happened i need to keep the train moving and he respects that he understands that
1564978 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1564979 so they can say they welcome me back but come on the way theyve treated me tells you the truth
1564980 does america really want to go through all that once again
1564981 drive a stake through his heart the beast is dead
1564982 romney hasnt gotten a very good return on his investment during this presidential campaign
1564983 im happy to take a look at my management style during the course of this last year and his i think they compare fairly well
1564984 a boost to obamas fortunes among time traveling high school kids from the early 1980s
1564985 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist
1564986 i think they are cynical their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
1564987 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
1564988 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
1564989 what we democrats cant afford to do even as we support senator obama is try to build one america on the cheap
1564990 people should not tell themselves i voted across the racial divide i have no obligations to do something in my community or around the world
1564991 behind a pair of spectacles there are a pair of mischievously twinkling eyes prying for bewitching tricks his artificial smile is the epitome of an unbridled character of a glib liar and his wide oval shaped face shows how he is ready to spew lies and calumnies and his glaring canine teeth protruding out from his wide open blaring mouth characterizes the kind of chronic lair he is look at him he is laughing out loud like a demented jackal i am afraid he looks like someone who is about to suffer from cerebral palsy
1564992 if you do walk in the clarts you will come home with clarty shoes
1564993 we feel like the u s flag honors his service in the mexican war
1564994 we feel like a soldier should have the honor and privilege of being buried under the flag in which they fought
1564995 in missouri a lot were fighting because they thought their state was being invaded
1564996 we seek to advance the cultural social economic and political well being and independence of the southern people by all honorable means
1564997 we all have a common enemy an enemy that is dangerous powerful and relentless i refer of course to the federal government
1564998 we have no control over what someone in florida says
1564999 conventional wisdom suggested that sander latest in a family line of officeholders would be a formidable if not unbeatable candidate
1565000 finally after hours of going back and forth from the bathroom to the couch my wife passed what i first saw as a black spot on the computer monitor the books say to collect the tissue in case your doctor wants to test it to determine the cause the books dont say how youre supposed to do this callie had me fetch a tupperware dish and a plastic spoon
1565001 my changeup was real good thats what ive been waiting for
1565002 give all the credit to j j he kept us in the game
1565003 its fraught with animal welfare concerns and it does not bring back a loved one
1565004 a dead animals dna does not guarantee the offspring will be identical to the deceased it takes more than just genes to create an animal
1565005 we dont need new sources to compete with animal shelters and reputable breeders
1565006 the cells status was indeed bad as they had been stored for a long time
1565007 but the scientific technology has also developed compared with when we cloned snuppy there is no room for any doubt over whether they are real clones
1565008 i believe that booger was an angel that god rented out to me for short period of time
1565009 and he knew i would be lost without him so he sent me some more he sent me five more mini boogers
1565010 andy warhol said we all get our 15 minutes of fame
1565011 ive already had an hour and a half i mean im so overexposed im making paris hilton look like a recluse
1565012 if you dont choose my idea you are against me

1565014 i will sing in san francisco if i have to sing in the streets because i know that the streets of san francisco are free
1565015 we welcome foreign visitors but for those who come here with the intent to do harm there are going to be consequences
1565016 it will diminish the icjs credibility and lessen the incentive for countries to bring cases to the icj in the first place
1565017 qu he hecho estos meses para no hacer nada que recuerde
1565018 de d nde vengo y a d nde voy y qui n soy
1565019 porque el cerebro humano ha sido gen ticamente concebido para sostener las creencias religiosas
1565020 la meditaci n activar a ciertas funciones cerebrales que son las que crean la sensaci n de plenitud absoluta y de comuni n trascendental
1565021 no conozco dec a el doctor ninguna excepci n a esto
1565022 when you ask them what theyre interested in the answer is always i really dont care im looking for the gas mileage
1565023 you can fill up a tank for about six dollars
1565024 so theyre talking about a very short ride but a tremendous savings
1565025 its unfounded because it ignores the manner in which the former superintendent mr cataldo ran the district as well as the manner in which he chose to share or not share information with not only the board members but with the staff and community as well
1565026 its hard to take responsibility for something you didnt have knowledge of
1565027 the feedback that we received was as long as they were being used for education purposes it was fine gifts and donations from other districts to the diocese are fairly routine
1565028 durch einen komischen zufall schreibe ich dieses buch in einem keller aber es ist nicht das horror haus
1565029 obwohl die wohnfl che meines kellers fast gleich gro ist wie die von elisabeth fritzls keller muss ich meine wohnung nur mit einer person teilen meinem sohn er ist 24 weniger als zwei monate nach elisabeth fritzls verschwinden geboren und obwohl wir nur zu zweit sind gehen wir uns sehr oft auf die nerven
1565030 die menschen in elisabeths heimatstadt amstetten und die sterreichischen beh rden haben nicht hingesehen als sie als kleines m dchen sexuell missbraucht wurde und als sie verschwand haben sie nicht die fragen gestellt die n tig gewesen w ren um sie zu retten und die b sen pl ne ihres vaters zunichtezumachen
1565031 1984 zwei wochen nach den olympischen spielen in los angeles wurde eine junge frau in einer kleinen stadt in sterreich in einen keller gezerrt und wiederholt vergewaltigt und w hrend elisabeth fritzl in ihrem verlies dahinvegetierte drehte sich die welt im ausgehenden 20 jahrhundert weiter das attentat auf indira ghandi ronald reagans zweite amtszeit die wahl von nicholas sarkozy zum franz sischen pr sidenten der amoklauf auf der virginia tech high school doch dann drei tage sp ter am samstag den 19 april 2008 wurde eine junge frau mit der rettung in das mostviertel rotkreuz spital in amstetten 75 km von wien entfernt eingeliefert sie lag im koma und niemand wusste was mit ihr los war eine stunde sp ter tauchte der 73 j hrige josef fritzl im spital auf er erkl rte das m dchen w re seine enkelin kerstin sie w re vor seiner haust re abgelegt worden
1565032 josef fritzl hat wenig gesagt um die brutalen vergewaltigungen seiner tochter und die misshandlung ihrer drei kinder zu erkl ren
1565033 the only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today let us move forward with strong and active faith
1565034 a pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties
1565035 dont look with your look with your feet dont think with you head think with your hands
1565036 just build a synagogue here reform rabbis are the best
1565037 let nation not lift up sword against nation let them study war no more
1565038 let them beat the swords into plowshares their spears into pruning hooks and let their tractors be tractors once more
1565039 the system will be enforced within two months and islamabad will thus become the first district among 110 license issuing districts in the country to enforce such system as per 11th schedule of the motor vehicle ordinance 1965
1565040 the dichotomy between what olympics visitors will see and what residents experience
1565041 may be most visible in the stadiums once the games begin
1565042 political change however gradual and inconsistent has made china a significantly more open place for average people than it was a generation ago
1565043 the similarities between these two coming out parties are eye popping dissidents jailed social undesirables mainly poor migrant workers kicked out of town three rings of police checkpoints surrounding the city old buildings bulldozed security so overwhelming as to squeeze all the fun out of the party
1565044 today even the farmers in remote areas have satellite tvs
1565045 so whenever they see an election such as the one held in pakistan recently they may wonder why even though we have approximately the same economic conditions they can elect their top leaders and we cant even vote for the leader of a small county i think a consciousness of political rights has increased more than anything
1565046 we need perspective on this i was there during the cultural revolution and i watched people being carted away in the streets to be shot in the back of the neck about 3 million people died ive been back often since and each time there is a sort of incremental freedom though sometimes it moves backward
1565047 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1565048 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1565049 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1565050 muchas comuniones nacionales o confesionales que quedaron disgregadas de la sede romana
1565051 entre las que conservan en parte las tradiciones y las estructuras cat licas ocupa lugar especial la comuni n anglicana
1565052 puesto que la iglesia cat lica romana y las iglesias que constituyen la comuni n anglicana han buscado crecer en la comprensi n mutual y en el amor cristiano han llegado a reconocer a valorar y dar gracias por la fe com n en dios nuestro padre en nuestro se or jesucristo y en el esp ritu santo por nuestro com n bautismo en cristo por compartir las sagradas escrituras los credos apost lico y niceno la definici n de calcedonia y la ense anza de los padres de la iglesia por nuestro patrimonio cristiano com n de muchos siglos con sus tradiciones vivientes de la liturgia de la teolog a de la espiritualidad y de la misi n
1565053 el logro de puntos de convergencia e inclusive de acuerdo que muchos podr an haber pensado que no era posible antes que la comisi n comenzara su trabajo
1565054 haber fortalecido en gran parte un acuerdo en esas reas
1565055 con el desarrollo de nuestro di logo muchos cat licos y anglicanos han encontrado los unos en los otros un amor a cristo que nos invita a una cooperaci n y a un servicio pr cticos esta uni n al servicio de cristo vivida por muchas de nuestras comunidades en todo el mundo da un mpetu ulterior a nuestra relaci n
1565056 los interrogantes y problemas de nuestros amigos son tambi n nuestros interrogantes y problemas
1565057 pero a partir de este encuentro de mississauga las iglesias de la comuni n anglicana han ingresado en un per odo de disputas ocasionado por la ordenaci n episcopal de una persona que vive en una relaci n homosexual llevada a cabo abierta y conscientemente y por la autorizaci n de ritos p blicos de bendici n para uniones homosexuales estas cuestiones han intensificado la reflexi n sobre la naturaleza de la relaci n entre las iglesias de la comuni n adem s las relaciones ecum nicas se han tornado m s complicadas cuando las propuestas en el interior de la iglesia de inglaterra han focalizado su atenci n en el tema de la ordenaci n de mujeres al episcopado lo cual es una parte instituida del ministerio en algunas provincias anglicanas
1565058 desde el comienzo el oficio episcopal fue koin nica o colegialmente ensamblado en la comuni n de todos los obispos nunca fue percibido como un oficio que deb a ser entendido o practicado individualmente
1565059 quam unitatem tenere firmiter et vindicare debemus maxime episcopi qui in ecclesia praesidimus ut episcopatum quoque ipsum unum atque indivisum probemus
1565060 episcopatus unus est cuius a singulis in solidum pars tenetur
1565061 unida y sostenida conjuntamente por la argamasa de la mutua cohesi n de los obispos
1565062 para hacer fomentar y crecer esta comuni n nuestro se or jesucristo ha provisto un ministerio de supervisi n cuya plenitud le ha sido confiada al episcopado que tiene la responsabilidad de conservar y expresar la unidad de las iglesias cf 33 amp 39 informe final ministerio y ordenaci n final report ministry and ordination a trav s de la labor pastoral la ense anza y la celebraci n de los sacramentos especialmente la eucarist a este ministerio mantiene a los creyentes unidos en la comuni n de la iglesia local y en la comuni n m s amplia de todas las iglesias cf 39 este ministerio de supervisi n tiene una dimensi n colegial y a la vez primacial tiene su fundamento en la vida de la comunidad y est abierta a la participaci n de la comunidad en el discernimiento de la voluntad de dios se ejerce de tal modo que esa unidad y comuni n se expresan preservan y promueven a todo nivel local regional y universal
1565063 est destinado a asegurar a cada comunidad que su fe es ciertamente la fe apost lica recibida y transmitida desde la poca apost lica
1565064 en la comuni n con la tradici n apost lica hay dos dimensiones la diacr nica y la sincr nica el proceso de tradici n perpet a claramente la transmisi n del evangelio de una generaci n a otra dimensi n diacr nica si la iglesia ha de permanecer unida en la fe entonces debe perpetuar la comuni n de las iglesias en todos los lugares y en ese nico evangelio dimensi n sincr nica ambas dimensiones son necesarias para la catolicidad de la iglesia 26
1565065 una voz para la iglesia local y al mismo tiempo una voz a trav s de la cual la iglesia local aprende de otras iglesias
1565066 la interdependencia mutua de todas las iglesias es esencial para la realidad de la iglesia como dios quiere que sea ninguna iglesia local que participe en la tradici n viva puede verse a s misma como autosuficiente el ministerio del obispo es crucial porque este ministerio sirve de comuni n dentro y entre las iglesias locales la comuni n de stas entre s se expresa mediante la incorporaci n de cada obispo a un colegio de obispos los obispos est n personal y colegialmente al servicio de la comuni n
1565067 a pesar que los temas eclesiol gicos sustanciales que todav a nos dividen seguir n reclamando nuestra atenci n este acercamiento est fundamentalmente en l nea con la eclesiolog a de comuni n del concilio vaticano segundo las consecuencias que el informe esboza a partir de su base eclesiol gica son constructivos tambi n especialmente la interpretaci n de la autonom a provincial en t rminos de interdependencia es decir sujeto a l mites generados por los mandamientos de comuni n windsor n 79 relacionado con esto la intenci n del informe est orientada hacia el fortalecimiento de la autoridad supra provincial del arzobispo de canterbury nn 109 110 y hacia la propuesta de una alianza anglicana que har a m s expl cita y en rgica la lealtad y los lazos de afecto que gobiernan las relaciones entre las iglesias de la comuni n n 118
1565068 mientras el informe pone de relieve que cada una de las provincias anglicanas tiene una responsabilidad hacia las otras y hacia el mantenimiento de la comuni n una comuni n arraigada en las sagradas escrituras llamativamente se le da poca atenci n a lo importante que es estar en comuni n con la fe de la iglesia a trav s de todas las pocas
1565069 tiene importantes ramificaciones ecum nicas por cuanto compartimos una tradici n com n de un milenio y medio este patrimonio com n que el papa pablo vi y el arzobispo michael ramsay denominaron nuestras antiguas tradiciones comunes merece ser estimulado y preservado
1565070 es nuestro irrenunciable deseo que la comuni n anglicana permanezca unida arraigada en la fe hist rica que nuestro di logo y nuestras relaciones durante m s de cuatro d cadas nos ha llevado a creer que compartimos en gran medida
1565071 en las discusiones sobre sexualidad humana dentro de la comuni n anglicana y entre sta y la iglesia cat lica se plantean cuestiones antropol gicas y de hermen utica b blica que deben ser tratadas
1565072 la ordenaci n sacerdotal desde el principio ha sido reservada siempre en la iglesia cat lica exclusivamente a los hombres
1565073 esta tradici n se ha mantenido tambi n fielmente en las iglesias orientales
1565074 declaro que la iglesia no tiene en modo alguno la facultad de conferir la ordenaci n sacerdotal a las mujeres y que este dictamen debe ser considerado como definitivo por todos los fieles de la iglesia

1565085 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street
1565086 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
1565087 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks
1565088 there might be one or two things that havent leaked yet
1565089 no one should even think they know the subject of the talk
1565090 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades and none of us saw it until dan put it all together
1565091 this is the mother lode all right from the point of view of internet criminals looking for easier access to other peoples money and secrets
1565092 a crude mix of right wingery lame puns and puerile innuendo
1565093 mccains effort to play on the bigoted fears of americans who unfairly associate a capital gains tax increase with the african american community
1565094 the republicans are going to try to make an issue of that fact that i dont look like all those guys on the coins because im not made of zinc or copper or that the color of my skin is a reason to fear that i will raise your payroll tax
1565095 a crude mix of right wingery lame puns and puerile innuendo
1565096 its unfortunate for tiger and its a shame probably for the spectators but i dont think it takes anything away from the tournament
1565097 i mean it certainly didnt take anything away from the british open championship
1565098 you can only win the tournament youre playing in you can only win the week youre playing and you can only beat the field that is there
1565099 so its irrelevant at the end of the day who is in the field
1565100 ive got to say jack nicklaus didnt play in the open championship and neither did arnold palmer or ben hogan
1565101 we can list a number of players the greats of the game that werent there
1565102 my second might have been third or whatever i dont know
1565103 might mean that im one place further up the leader board come sunday but i dont think it takes anything away from the tournament it is what it is i think its an opportunity for a lot of people to try to take advantage of the worlds no 1 not being in the golf tournament
1565104 the methodical and calculated steps these extremists took showed blatant disregard for the safety and welfare of our community
1565105 this reward is an important first step toward bringing those involved to justice
1565106 the guarantee of free speech embodied in the bill of rights envisions responsible protest and respect for others
1565107 when people become so blinded by ideology they commit crimes that trample the rights of their neighbors and put lives in danger the fbi must act
1565108 we just dont know how he is going to respond so its a difficult situation ive got to be a realist and i cant see danny playing this weekend because hes not even headed a ball yet as a forward you have to head the ball and until he can do that i cant play him
1565109 we didnt want him to join in the training session because we want to make sure he recovers hell be fine for saturday
1565110 hes out of contract and back home so its a chance for us to have a look at him
1565111 this is a case of criminality were talking about a huge long term investigation with a huge impact on people
1565112 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1565113 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1565114 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1565115 it just really solidifies this biotech cluster were trying to create
1565116 every interest is aligned for us to take those innovative discoveries from basic biomedical research turn them into therapeutics test them in the clinic and ultimately take them to the market to help patients
1565117 san francisco offers companies like pfizer a world class urban innovation district anchored by the nations pre eminent biomedical university and unparalleled opportunities for collaboration and access to the very best talent that the united states and the world have to offer
1565118 there is a huge advantage of the physical proximity of academic scientists and industry scientists

1565136 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1565137 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1565138 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1565139 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1565140 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1565141 it really gives us hope that we can look everybody in the eye and say your child is going to a safe school
1565142 what has been done in the past year to address the problem of chronic underreporting and the questionable school safety data that results from it
1565143 city officials can bend statistics any way they want but there is no substitute for transparency
1565144 when youre faced with traffic and dense traffic its easier to get a smaller more efficient vehicle through there
1565145 they accelerate quicker they brake easier they turn quicker so they can shave a few minutes off each response
1565146 the intention is to have sprint vehicles in various areas of adelaide where the demand is greater and where the traffic congestion is greater etcetera we will always need the same number of ambulances if not more as demand increases to transport people that sprint have dealt with in advance stabilised and then they are moved to hospital
1565147 the parliamentary liberal party has elected colin barnett as its leader
1565148 the election was for one nomination only and was unopposed
1565149 this is a significant relief for gas users as well as the economy of western australia mr carpenter told reporters
1565150 the worst of the situation is clearly over we still have a long way to go
1565151 we have constant conversations with all our customers and try to meet their needs as best we can
1565152 before construction can commence and these are the critical matters there must be an environmental management framework developed environmental management plans done for each of the segments of the pipeline
1565153 were extremely disappointed by todays announcement but not surprised that the government has given this the go ahead
1565154 of course weekly tickets or the fortnightly tickets you can purchase them any day of the week unfortunately most people because of habit do that mondays and tuesdays
1565155 if we can push that number across to other days thats a benefit if we can halve the number of people queuing by getting them to do it just once a fortnight that will also have a benefit
1565156 for the period 1 july 2007 to 30 june 2008 inclusive ebitda before significant items was 652 9 million dollars in line with ascianos previous market guidance
1565157 the proceeds will be used to fund future growth opportunities and to provide additional flexibility for asciano in respect of its longer term capital structure
1565158 thats good now i dont have to explain to people that i work with a bunch of loonies i can just tell them the name of the company
1565159 prices will remain on the downward trend but i dont think they will fall that much but be rangebound around 118 120 a barrel
1565160 our biggest worries are nigeria the hurricane season etc we cannot relax too much there is very robust demand in china india and the middle east
1565161 we have been saying we are reviewing flights due to surging fuel prices
1565162 pressures for higher rates are likely to linger on the committee
1565163 overall we cannot entirely rule out the risk that the committee will sanction higher rates this time
1565164 centricas 35 percent increase in domestic tariffs suggests that inflation will hit 5 0 percent
1565165 inflationary pressures continue to prevent the mpc from cutting rates in response to the deteriorating real economy
1565166 in fact if interest rates change this month they are more likely to go up than down
1565167 we suspect that most mpc members are still firmly in wait and see mode and in no hurry to move interest rates given the current major uncertainties surrounding both the medium term inflation and growth outlooks
1565168 the scene was set for today with the fall in oil inspired rally in the u s and the federal reserve retaining a neutral stance

1565194 this trial against khadr if it were to go forward would be the very first time a judge would preside over the war crimes trial of a former child soldier
1565195 arrested in afghanistan in 2002 detained for over five years at guantanamo bay omar khadr has endured the kind of cruel inhumane and degrading treatment that the world condemns
1565196 as a canadian citizen and a minor at the time of his alleged crimes omar khadr should be adjudicated in a canadian juvenile court compelled to appear before an extraordinary military commission convened by the united states to prosecute foreign terrorists khadr will be deprived of the protections guaranteed by the international treaties to which the united states itself is a party
1565197 would it be all right if we just sat and just got back loved it that is all

1565225 cumprimos tudo o que a vigil ncia nos pediu em termos de documentos e adequa es das telas de prote o e ralos
1565226 o material vencido estava ensacado numa prateleira parte erramos ao n o identificar a prateleira informando que eram produtos vencidos o que j corrigimos quanto soda c ustica que estava pr xima a produtos aliment cios garantimos que o material n o estava na mesma prateleira e havia espa o entre um material e outro
1565227 esse o modo mais radical de fazer com que a lei seja cumprida mas certo diante de tudo o que tem acontecido
1565228 na minha opini o as pessoas deveriam ser mais conscientes n o era preciso ter uma lei para dizer que n o se deve dirigir alcoolizado
1565229 mas tenho v rios amigos que bebem e j perdi parentes em acidentes
1565230 a lei seca diminuiu bastante o n mero de acidentes e isso muito bom acho que est certo mesmo temos que entrar no tr nsito mais conscientes
1565231 eu acho que n o precisava ter sido t o radical mas se n o fosse assim as pessoas n o iriam respeitar
1565232 um dos motivos para eu tirar a carteira era sair noite mas claro que n o vou beber e dirigir vou ter que continuar indo de carona com meus amigos
1565233 achei que seria provis rio agora uma quest o de mudar de h bitos mesmo antes era respeitar ou n o agora acatar
1565234 infelizmente as pessoas mais conscientes est o pagando por quem n o tem tanta consci ncia assim mas enquanto a mentalidade das pessoas n o mudar vai ter que ser assim
1565235 hoje em dia muitos jovens querem sair para beber ali s alguns jovens s o praticamente obrigados a beber para fazer parte do grupo j ouvi muitos amigos dizendo que agora v o voltar s 4h30 da manh para fugir da blitz quando o ideal seria que as pessoas se conscientizassem e n o tentassem burlar a lei
1565236 estat sticas indicam que o maior ndice de morte entre jovens tinha como motivo a associa o de lcool e dire o
1565237 a lei seca na verdade ampliou o que j vinha acontecendo no estado o projeto come ou como uma campanha educativa depois passou a associar fiscaliza o propaganda e outras a es
1565238 quem tem 18 anos hoje j vem ouvindo sobre o perigo de dirigir e beber desde os 15 16 anos uma nova gera o de condutores que sabe os riscos que corre
1565239 uma pesquisa do ano passado mostrou que 90 dos capixabas recebem bem o madrugada viva as pessoas querem seguran a
1565240 the next thing i knew they were going to euthanize everything
1565241 i mean i can see euthanizing some that are sick and suffering that should be done but to just euthanize everything in there and we could have found rescue groups to help place them if they were over crowding it was treatable
1565242 we did not want expose the community with some sick pets
1565243 i walked back there at one point and they were all piled on top of each other just laying there dead
1565244 oh that was fun it was it was it was kind of exhausting you know we get exhausted easily
1565245 well it really stirred up my energy normally i would just be sitting and the team has been trying to encourage the motion in my arms because ive had a lot of surgeries here
1565246 after you really get involved in it you forget the therapy part because i really wanted to knock that little guy out
1565247 you get even that little bit involved in the game and you want to be able to do it quickly and do it correctly
1565248 it actually helps them to carry over those skills in to their activities of daily living so if they are able to move better and endure a task better then they are able to care for themselves better
1565249 i am upset with my lack of mobility and here its encouraging me and stimulating me to more mobility you see this is a part of helping me to get out of my chair
1565250 i wouldnt dare buy one because id be on the doing it all the time im afraid
1565251 i think that this is the most rewarding population to work with because when you see the gains and you can see them getting back into their normal routines and their quality of life its just so much better
1565252 i dont know at this point and time its my understanding that councilmember clarkson called my office but were going to try and figure out exactly what they would like for me to present and well see if its appropriate for me to attend
1565253 for the first time we got a letter from a board member that suggested we take certain action because he was very concerned and we did that
1565254 i wouldnt say i am opposed to it but there is a lot of responsibility to it
1565255 if my teammates feel like i am the guy i will make the decision at that point but right now i am a lot more focused on improving as a safety than whether i am going to fill that role this year
1565256 you meet a lot of interesting people a lot of old timers
1565257 and just associating with guys from across the league is kind of fun you do it for the good of the team for the good of guys
1565258 so many guys gave up so much ahead of us from the strikes of the past guys who wouldnt cross the picket line guys who fought for the benefits we have now somebody on the team has the duty to carry it on now and respect what they have done
1565259 in our minicamps he was good and then it was just a matter of him being able to hold up in pass protection
1565260 a lot of people dont think ill be able to do it because of my size but i tell them all the time low pad wins
1565261 theres not too many linebackers in the nfl my size so ive got a little advantage on that point i was prepared in college to block first and run second so thats the kind of mentality i bring
1565262 at first you do kind of question his size but that kid has a big heart and thats all that matters in this league
1565263 i logged on at 10 03 and everything was sold out
1565264 a bunch of us at the office were looking at obstructed view and family view and even those were gone
1565265 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1565266 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
1565267 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving

1565294 five years ago there were lots and lots of people whod never heard of a churro and many of the people who did know what one was had had one at disneyland or at a ballpark
1565295 ill tip my hat to them they familiarized the american people with churros and gave people that first wonderful experience
1565296 theyre sold in the mornings by women who carry large flat baskets on their heads
1565297 these churros are made at home and brought into the market to sell still hot and covered with granulated sugar
1565298 the menu is churros and four kinds of hot chocolate and thats it

1565301 weve worked a lot of latino ingredients into our cooking and weve hit the second wave now people are thinking past hard shell tacos and looking for more authentic flavors
1565302 hispanics are by far the largest minority in the u s and we are just starting to see the tremendous impact on our culture
1565303 when i first opened the original store in san rafael california in 2003 i didnt see many churros around but now especially in the last year theyre popping up all over the place
1565304 they mean a lot to people it gets them thinking about being with their families and we get a lot of emotional reactions weve had people who come in and cry
1565305 you bite into this crispy crunchy pastry with its ridges crunchy on the inside warm and soft inside and well theres nothing else like them

1565311 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1565312 one more person says one more nasty thing to me and i am leaving this family
1565313 she said she usually cried at least once each day not because she was sad but because the world was so beautiful and life was so short
1565314 if you hold on to the handle she said its easier to maintain the illusion of control but its more fun if you just let the wind carry you
1565315 they came to sit amp dangle their feet off the edge of the world amp after awhile they forgot everything but the good amp true things they would do someday
1565316 i sometimes wake in the early morning amp listen to the soft breathing of my children amp i think to myself this is one thing i will never regret amp i carry that quiet with me all day long

1565330 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1565331 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1565332 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1565333 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake

1565342 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1565343 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1565344 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes

1565351 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor and sign onto the american energy act our all of the above plan to increase conservation innovation and american energy production instead of doing the speakers bidding by voting against bringing it to a vote if you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one youre siding with the speaker of the drill nothing congress and radical special interests that favor higher gas prices at the expense of energy strapped american families
1565352 this cynical strategy is disgustingly dishonest without any real solutions to help americans who are struggling with record high gas prices it appears the democratic leadership has hit on a new plan deceive deceive the press deceive its members and deceive the american people democratic members have a pass from their leaders to talk about drilling at home while the liberal democratic leadership which is beholden to special interests that want higher gas prices plays rope a dope back in washington ensuring there is no vote to help the american people before november its cynical dishonest and wrong and it wont work
1565353 dontgo movement is a collaborative effort being developed by a group of free market e activists who wish to see congress stay in washington until a solution for our energy crisis is found
1565354 we all do have the power lets not wait for government
1565355 energy prices are not going back to the good old days

1565364 he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this and cheney proceeded to meet with renewable energy groups once and met with the oil companies 40 times
1565365 john mccain has taken a page out of the bush cheney playbook hes offering a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1565366 while senator mccains plan wont save you at the pump any time soon i have to say this it sure has raised him a lot of campaign dollars
1565367 senator mccain raised more than 1 million from the oil industry just last month just last month most of which came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling to a roomful of oil executives
1565368 i think both sherrod and i have discovered how to win ohio
1565369 we feel as if there could be great benefit to his campaign by spending some time with the two of us in various parts of ohio and perhaps getting a bus and going into rural areas of ohio
1565370 why should people who can afford cars get such cheap petrol when i who will never own a car dont get such help and have to pay more for basic goods

1565374 the mice that were inactive put wood shavings in their treadmills and made them beds or actually used them as potties which tells you what they think of exercise

1565376 take more steps walk up an escalator park further away lose the remote control walk around while youre talking on the phone
1565377 dont use an excuse saying oh its my genes that made me do it
1565378 the thinking is this probably triggers serotonin and dopamine in the brain which are mood elevators or mood determinants
1565379 remember people who are clinically depressed tend to be very inactive people who arent clinically depressed tend to be more active and when you are active you actually do elevate your mood and you do actually change the level of serotonin and dopamine in your brain so its clear that the brain system and a sense of activity and energy are linked
1565380 there are so many other benefits that come from exercise
1565381 theres mood elevation theres reduction of osteoporosis theres reduction of diabetes theres cardiopulmonary benefits you get none of this with a pill so wed be slender unhealthy people as opposed to slender healthy people
1565382 the guys got like a 10 foot wingspan i dont know how he ever gets blocked
1565383 as a player you always have the mentality that you can get better
1565384 the thing that makes them really good is they always find a way to get better
1565385 the moment you think youve got it all figured out and you think youre good enough is the moment you lose your edge
1565386 theres always little things you can get better at stuff that youre quite good at but you can get a little bit better at
1565387 thats pretty much what were out here for to tune up the things were great at and work on some things were no so good at
1565388 as good as julian is hes the first to recognize he can be better
1565389 we want him to be more of a calculating player in terms of not taking as many risks and educated guesses
1565390 hes a really smart player so sometimes he may guess
1565391 thats one of the areas he can get better at
1565392 as much film study and as many notes as i take during the week it can kind of get into your head oh i know whats coming
1565393 but the offenses self scout and they know youre on to their moves so theyll throw a wrinkle at you
1565394 thats what were doing out here working to get better
1565395 if hasselbeck is not comfortable with how youre getting into your route and where youre going youre not one of those guys hes going to call upon during the season

1565410 i found that the older i got the less people listened to me
1565411 since i could do nothing about their listening i had to become a better and more interesting speaker people who had no interest in talking with me before now engage me in conversation

1565421 this government may already have garnered a reputation for being the most antiscience government in canadian history
1565422 it should come as no surprise that prevention hasnt improved perhaps the prevention of further harm and more death should be prevention enough and we shouldnt expect one single intervention to solve the problem of drug addiction itself after all this is a harm reduction project we are talking about not harm prevention
1565423 sufficiently inflamed drug warriors that they cannot have a rational discussion of even the underlying concept let alone how harm reduction strategies might be implemented
1565424 lets get on with studying specific strategies to protect the public health and ensure social well being and give up this term that only gets in the way even if it does make sense
1565425 i absolutely cringe when i hear people talk of a safe injection site
1565426 for what must be the first time in health canadas history the department is trying to bury a study that highlights how one of its programs improves healthcare outcomes to canadas most marginalized citizens
1565427 without commitment to strong rights and the sovereignty of users harm reduction sentiments are easily subverted to a technocratic governance agenda against the accusation that we are really legalizers harm reduction advocates need not dispute the label but rather the suggestion that opposition to the drug war is somehow irresponsible dishonest or immoral respect for human rights moves harm reduction past the confines of a scientific project which has not been well respected outside academic circles toward a generative programme for replacing prohibition with policies reflecting the costs and benefits of drug use and the costs and benefits of formal intervention
1565428 the sign of a truly totalitarian culture is that important truths simply lack cognitive meaning and are interpretable only at the level of fuck you so they can then elicit a perfectly predictable torrent of abuse in response
1565429 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1565430 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1565431 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1565432 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan

1565437 but if you dont mind can i put a camera down your throat
1565438 the fault of dawkins as an academic was his scandalous and apparently deliberate refusal to present the doctrine which he appears to think he has refuted in its strongest form
1565439 an academic attacking some ideological position which he believes to be mistaken must of course attack that position in its strongest form this dawkins does not do in the case of einstein and his failure is the crucial index of his insincerity of academic purpose and therefore warrants me in charging him with having become what he has probably believed to be an impossibility a secularist bigot
1565440 the whole enterprise of the god delusion was not as it at least pretended to be an attempt to discover and spread knowledge of the existence or non existence of god but rather an attempt an extremely successful one to spread the authors own convictions in this area
1565441 antony flew having lost the ability to write a book was persuaded by a christian ghost writer roy varghese to let him write it instead it is one thing for a footballer or a supermodel to use a ghost writer but there is something absurd about a philosopher using a ghost writer
1565442 flew has now apparently lost the ability to read a book too for his review of the god delusion turns out to be a review of its index and nothing but its index he only needed to read chapter 1 in order to see the absurdity of his claims about my treatment of einstein
1565443 do you know the work of the philosopher john leslie
1565444 im afraid this is a spectacle of my not remembering
1565445 he showed it to me and i said o k im too old for this kind of work
1565446 there was stuff he had written before and some of that was adapted to this
1565447 there is stuff hed written to me in correspondence and i organized a lot of it
1565448 he was well respected by his peers but even more so by the folks that lived out here
1565449 the support we received and the money we raised on the night was sensational
1565450 to make such significant inroads into our debt in one night has provided a fantastic start to our debt demolition campaign

1565456 obama said a couple of days ago says we all should inflate our tires i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
1565457 i dont think that that inflating tires is a way to become energy independent
1565458 difficult and was by no means arrived at without thoughtful consideration
1565459 more canadians will have access to quality and trusted health information
1565460 its one thing to take away a really great consumer health resource its another to take it away and leave a pointer referring people to another resource that is virtually useless for the same type of information seeking
1565461 the conservative government has had to make decisions as a result of cuts to spending made in the previous governments budgets
1565462 moving from three sites to two will result in saving 7 million per year
1565463 rest assured that phac will work with chn in the transfer of information wherever possible
1565464 rest assured that canadians will continue to have access to the important healthcare information they need
1565465 i think if were spending 20 million and we have one out of seven folks in the country that are functionally illiterate weve got to fix the ground floor problem and not be trying to do repair work after the fact
1565466 daily reading appears to be a strong determinant of health literacy
1565467 the question is are we willing as a country to make the investment that is required to create a health literate canada
1565468 our research suggests that nurses and other health care professionals dont need to suppress humour
1565469 when youve had the most stressful day and youre ready to cry sometimes its easier to bring out humour and take it in the other direction instead of bawling on somebodys shoulder
1565470 if you have those fun moments and that connectedness even the worst hell can happen
1565471 you sail through it as opposed to walking out really wounded
1565472 shall i chart that you made a confession or that you made a mistake
1565473 dont worry if i can hear it im still alive
1565474 some people feel that humour is trivial and unprofessional in health care settings but this study shows that it is neither
1565475 despite major differences between the work of the intensive care and palliative care units they are both areas where serious illness high anxiety and patient and family distress are prevalent and staff are placed in emotionally demanding situations crises are frequent death is close by and emotions tend to run high
1565476 one member of staff referred to humour as the glue that holds human connections together a statement that was clearly reinforced by our findings
1565477 our research suggests that nurses and other health care professionals dont need to suppress humour they should trust their instincts about when it is appropriate combined with scientific skill and compassion humour offers a humanizing dimension in health care that is too valuable to be overlooked
1565478 ive got one of these incontinence products albeit a new one not the ones that tend to appear at committee on my desk and im really giving this matter very serious contemplation

1565484 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1565485 one thing to learn from this trip was it doesnt matter what place you go all the matters with whom you go with how you enjoy you guys were really a surprise

1565497 readers should also be aware that the published list of additional databases includes hosts for databases such as dialog and ebsco rather than the databases themselves
1565498 that the availability of lists of databases is useful to researchers clinicians and other health care professionals
1565499 the development along with the spread of the world wide web www represents an informational sic revolution
1565500 in conclusion scientific databases of biomedical information are frequently used by both clinicians and researches sic in this article we compared the content and various practical aspects in sic the utility of the main databases of biomedical scientific information we found that pubmed remains an important source for clinicians and researchers
1565501 we will be educated in the latest technical lingo and sound just like computer scientists
1565502 one of the less mined as yet areas for us to explore and conquer is how to make raw data available to everyone
1565503 step up to the plate accept these challenges and go with the flow
1565504 desperate to slough off the old limiting stereotypes of the stern bespectacled cardigan clad shushing controller of books librarians are clamouring to convince themselves each other and the wider community that there is far more to the humble librarian than meets the casual eye
1565505 let us shrug off our clothes and get into the new gear of the future from naked librarian to formidable information force
1565506 chicora merged with queens college located in charlotte nc in 1915
1565507 it has been a tailors shop a cobblers shop a school and a gas station
1565508 the first location was augusta and church streets the land for furman university was purchased by vardry mcbee for 3 750
1565509 our goal is to promote live music in the west end
1565510 when festivals come people stop at the end of main street and they dont make it all the way down to the west end
1565511 were doing what we can to further drive people to the west end and remind people that were alive and well
1565512 maybe one day you will have features in drizzle that will be good for you
1565513 i think its important that we did send a message to anyone who thinks about playing by their own rules instead of those that the city puts forward
1565514 that the developer did not have permission pursuant to lexington permits to connect but did so anyway
1565515 in my recent conversations with the developer hes had no negative reactions as far as any work hes done up there
1565516 guaranteed to leave its perpetrators awash in the blood of innocents
1565517 even more forcefully to the mass terror against civilian populations routinely inflicted by the air forces and armies of so called democracies
1565518 my story has to do with the end of world war ii
1565519 we were putting together the nuclear bombs that finished hiroshima and nagasaki
1565520 i think that the nagasaki bomb should not have been dropped but it was
1565521 i think the first bomb gave the japanese time to think about what was hitting them the second bomb killed about 90 000 people it was a terrible thing however it ended the war in that sense we saved a lot of american lives but at the expense of a lot of japanese lives
1565522 i left grad school because i wanted to serve somehow in the military but was not drafted because i was a student of science
1565523 the local draft board in my home of new york city had a certain quota to fill i was given a deferment to allow me to finish my studies they thought i could be of greater service as a scientist than carrying a gun in the infantry
1565524 that seemed to be the most directly warlike thing i could do this was a government laboratory run by the army
1565525 he told me about this great project going on out west that had the capacity of winning the war and asked are you interested
1565526 it was highly secret and if i went out there i was expected to be living out there isolated for the remainder of the war which sounded pretty exciting to me
1565527 it was a rather tricky bomb to assemble and fused a lot of new principles
1565528 the components of the bomb were shipped separately you dont ship a bomb with detonators ready to go the mariana islands were the biggest staging base for the bombing of japan
1565529 when i came back after the war i went back to duke university to finish my degree that was in 1946
1565530 then i took a post doctoral job at the university of chicago i worked there for a couple years
1565531 i was invited to come teach at the chemistry lab at brandeis university when they were first getting started and that was around 1948
1565532 various landmarks in the united states including new york city
1565533 chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars

1565536 repairing cars was never my intent but we had to do something to pay the mortgage
1565537 its been a struggle i cannot survive just repairing cars
1565538 an illegal and unlicensed used car lot in violation of local ordinances
1565539 almost every time i drive past the location there are more then 14 cars on the lot
1565540 i have a constituent that bought a car from the petitioner the car was a lemon
1565541 if this is going to be a repair shop why do you need all these parking spaces
1565542 i just dont understand why you need 20 spaces for a repair business this small
1565543 police had to be called to remove them from the parking lot if i was going to the zoning board of appeals and i was trying to increase my parking i would make sure i would have my is dotted and my ts crossed
1565544 i have a police report here from just the other day two days ago they had to take parked cars and tow them out of the church parking lot

1565554 why waste energy on transporting fruit and veggies from the west coast when we can grow them in our yard in newton
1565555 we are always curious to test what works its truly an experimental thing
1565556 there are a variety of strategies to deal with this
1565557 working our own garden we see how much effort is involved in growing food which makes us appreciate locally grown food that much more
1565558 if people knew how much work went into it they might be more apt to go visit their local farmer
1565559 i think it is a good idea to know how to grow our own food
1565560 as fossil fuels become scare and more expensive i think we are going to have to grow a portion of our food ourselves
1565561 other days i am not so sure all in all it looks like it is going to be successful

1565563 it is odd that the logic of epidemiology embraced by the press every day regarding new drugs or health risks somehow changes when the mechanism of death is their armed forces
1565564 whatever the intentions of the ministry of health workers who carried out this study its findings are now out of their hands it is now a weapon for neutralising the findings of the lancet survey

1565568 if the fed can avoid raising interest rates now and if oil prices can keep falling any recession may be shallow
1565569 since investors tend to buy stocks six months ahead of a recovery some conclude now is the time to buy

1565571 circumcision is going to start to be taken up more widely as a public health measure to protect against hiv
1565572 most sexual transmission of hiv in the us and canada occurs through male male sex most often infecting the receptive partner in penile anal intercourse the results from the african trials demonstrated that circumcision was protective for men who were the insertive partner in vaginal intercourse suggesting that the utility of male circumcision in preventing hiv transmission among msm may be limited
1565573 there was no evidence that being circumcised was protective against hiv infection among black msm or latino msm

1565621 ties are rarely laundered but worn daily commonly outside the healthcare environment ties perform no beneficial function in patient care and have been shown to be colonised by pathogens
1565622 we think ties only give the baby boys something to take aim at
1565623 its always too hot in our nurseries for a tie
1565624 no tie is more comfortable id only need to take it off when bending down and most of all we think ties only give the baby boys something to take aim at
1565625 i watched the doctors come over for a physical exam or procedure and saw the neckties would swing in front of the patients face or patients would cough on them the necktie is important for the doctor patient relationship but its also there on the front lines dangling in front of patients as the doctor makes his rounds almost everything a doctor carries has bacteria from a cell phone to a stethoscope you can get to the point where the doctor is completely naked but then the skin is covered with bacteria too
1565626 this study brings into question whether wearing a necktie is in the best interest of our patients
1565627 being well dressed adds to an aura of professionalism and has been correlated with higher patient confidence senior physicians and hospital administrators often encourage staff to wear neckties in order to help promote this valuable relationship but in so doing they may also be facilitating the spread of infectious organisms
1565628 while there is no direct evidence to implicate neckties in the transmission of infection to patients the link between contaminated neckties and the potential for transmission must be considered
1565629 its not about ties its about things you dont clean
1565630 the reason people are picking on ties is they tend not to go into the laundry if you took them home and washed them the way you do your shirt there wouldnt be any problem
1565631 a well tied tie is the first serious step in life
1565632 keep potentially infectious ties from falling into places they should not

1565662 het is niet omdat het aantal oproepen daalt dat het belang van de praatpaal afneemt

1565667 de tijd dat de mensen zich schaamden voor tweedehandskledij ligt al lang achter ons
1565668 ik kom nog onder de mensen en durf nog een pint gaan drinken in olen boze reacties heb ik ook nog niet gekregen
1565669 tot vorige week werkte ik hier nog tien uur per dag en nu ineens niets meer dat steekt misschien begin ik elders nog wel met een handelszaak
1565670 ik hoop dat de curatoren mij hier nog laten uitverkopen mijn zoon rudi wil een bod doen op de inboedel mocht hij erin slagen de stock te verwerven dan zou zon uitverkoop nog flink wat kunnen opleveren
1565671 ja maar ik draaide hier nog goed hoor bijna 300 000 euro omzet per maand dat is toch niet slecht tijdens een uitverkoop waar alles aan min dertig en min vijftig procent staat de cafetaria trok nog altijd volk en we waren aan een goed mosselseizoen bezig
1565672 het aangekondigde shopping center dat investeringsmaatschappij intervest hier aan lammerdies zou bouwen sleept veel te lang aan het bedrijventerrein ligt er nu als een puinhoop bij aanlokkelijk is anders en ik geef toe ik heb ook wel te veel ge nvesteerd
1565673 hoezo gesloten ik kom hier mijn gordijnen ophalen ik heb een voorschot betaald dat is toch niet eerlijk
1565674 mijn zoon gert woont hier vlakbij hij hoorde rond 4 uur iets knetteren toen hij buitenkwam zag hij dat er vuur was in het bedrijf hij heeft eerst geprobeerd de vlammen met enkele poederblussers te lijf te gaan maar dat bleek onbegonnen werk
1565675 enkel met een kopje koffie probeer ik de dag door te komen
1565676 ik ben al negen jaar in belgi en mijn zes kinderen lopen hier school vijf van hen zijn hier geboren ik heb tot vier keer toe een regularisatie aangevraagd de laatste keer kreeg ik eindelijk een positief rapport maar na het gesprek dat erop volgde werden we weer afgekeurd

1565688 even though all those indicted in bonusgate were democrats three quarters say both parties are responsible for corruption in the state legislature
1565689 three quarters say the legislature probably doesnt have the ability to pass the laws needed to fix itself but they want the governor to call a special session to tackle corruption in the capitol
1565690 it felt like a huge rock a really powerful rock had been thrown up with great velocity
1565691 i just wanted him to get it out of me
1565692 i was imagining all the possibilities that could have happened
1565693 it could have hit my head hit my baby hit my friend in the spine and she couldve crashed it couldve hit the gas tank
1565694 i just was freaking out everyone at the hospital was very kind just wonderful and helped to calm me down
1565695 the baby was very ticked off at all the poking and started kicking and punching me
1565696 it looks like i got poked with something and it took a chunk out of me i got three or four stitches
1565697 you almost killed two people i want them to be more careful to not do that anymore
1565698 we believe the state is very committed to the direction we are taking
1565699 nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill
1565700 if it is not totalitarian to arrest a man and detain him when you cannot charge him with any offence against any written law if that is not what we have always cried out against in fascist states then what is it if we are to survive as a free democracy then we must be prepared in principle to concede to our enemies even those who do not subscribe to our views as much constitutional rights as you concede yourself
1565701 repression sir is a habit that grows i am told it is like making love it is always easier the second time the first time there may be pangs of conscience a sense of guilt but once embarked on this course with constant repetition you get more and more brazen in the attack all you have to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and banish and detain the key political workers in these societies then miraculously everything is tranquil on the surface then an intimidated press and the government controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have already been done or if these things are referred to again theyre conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity because there will be no opposition to contradict
1565702 if we say that we believe in democracy if we say that the fabric of a democratic society is one which allows for the free play of idea then in the name of all the gods give that free play a chance to work within the constitutional framework
1565703 repression can only go up to a point when it becomes too acute the instruments of repression namely the army and the police have been proved time and time again in history to have turned their guns on their masters
1565704 i pointed to an article with bold headlines reporting that the police had refused to allow the pap to hold a rally at empress place and then to the last paragraph where in small type it added the meeting would take place where we were now i compared this with a prominent report about an spa rally this was flagrant bias
1565705 if i were in authority in singapore indefinitely without having to ask those who are governed whether they like what is being done then i would not have the slightest doubt that i could govern much more effectively in their interests
1565706 let us get down to fundamentals is this an open or is this a closed society is it a society where men can preach ideas novel unorthodox heresies to established churches and established governments where there is a constant contest for mens hearts and minds on the basis of what is right of what is just of what is in the national interests or is it a closed society where the mass media the newspapers the journals publications tv radio either bound by sound or by sight or both sound and sight mens minds are fed with a constant drone of sycophantic support for a particular orthodox political philosophy i am talking of the principle of the open society the open debate ideas not intimidation persuasion not coercion
1565707 how does the malay in the kampong find his way out into this modernised civil society by becoming servants of the 0 3 per cent who would have the money to hire them to clean their shoe open their motorcar doors
1565708 of course there are chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses is it the answer to make a few malay millionaires with big cars and big houses how does telling a malay bus driver that he should support the party of his malay director umno and the chinese bus conductor to join another party of his chinese director mca how does that improve the standards of the malay bus driver and the chinese bus conductor who are both workers in the same company if we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no malay rights or because opposition members oppose malay rights where are we going to end up you let people in the kampongs believe that they are poor because we dont speak malay because the government does not write in malay so he expects a miracle to take place in 1967 the year malay would become the national and sole official language in malaysia the moment we all start speaking malay he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living and if doesnt happen what happens then meanwhile whenever there is a failure of economic social and educational policies you come back and say oh these wicked chinese indian and others opposing malay rights they dont oppose malay rights they the malay have the right as malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies the non malay society has produced that is what must be done isnt it not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get malay rights for the few special malays and their problem has been resolved
1565709 they the malay extremists have triggered off something basic and fundamental malaysia to whom does it belong to malaysians but who are malaysians i hope i am mr speaker sir but sometimes sitting in this chamber i doubt whether i am allowed to be a malaysian this is the doubt that hangs over many minds and the next contest if this goes on will be on very different lines
1565710 once emotions are set in motion and men pitted against men along these unspoken lines you will have the kind of warfare that will split the nation from top to bottom and undo malaysia everybody knows it i dont have to say it it is the unspoken word
1565711 according to history malays began to migrate to malaysia in noticeable numbers only about 700 years ago of the 39 percent malays in malaysia today about one third are comparatively new immigrants like the secretary general of umno dato syed jaafar albar who came to malaya from indonesia just before the war at the age of more than thirty therefore it is wrong and illogical for a particular racial group to think that they are more justified to be called malaysians and that the others can become malaysian only through their favour
1565712 three women were brought to the singapore general hospital each in the same condition and needing a blood transfusion the first a southeast asian was given the transfusion but died a few hours later the second a south asian was also given a transfusion but died a few days later the third an east asian was given a transfusion and survived that is the x factor in development
1565713 for me it is a moment of anguish all my life my whole adult life i believed in merger and unity of the two territories
1565714 do not worry about singapore my colleagues and i are sane rational people even in our moments of anguish we will weigh all possible consequences before we make any move on the political chessboard
1565715 we must encourage those who earn less than 200 per month and cannot afford to nurture and educate many children never to have more than two we will regret the time lost if we do not now take the first tentative steps towards correcting a trend which can leave our society with a large number of the physically intellecually and culturally anaemic
1565716 let us not deceive ourselves our talent profile is nowhere near that of say the jews or the japanese in america the exceptional number of nobel prize winners who are jews is no accident it is also no accident that a high percentage sometimes 50 of faculty members in the top american universities on both the east and west coasts are jews and the number of high calibre japanese academics professionals and business executives is out of all proportion to the percentage of japanese in the total american population
1565717 if you dont include your women graduates in your breeding pool and leave them on the shelf you would end up a more stupid society so what happens there will be less bright people to support dumb people in the next generation thats a problem
1565718 without the cpf singaporeans would buy enormous quantities of clothes shoes furniture television sets radio tape recorders hi fis washing machines motor cars they would have no substantial or permanent asset to show for it
1565719 we have to lock up people without trial whether they are communists whether they are language chauvinists whether they are religious extremists if you dont do that the country would be in ruins
1565720 i am often accused of interfering in the private lives of citizens yes if i did not had i not done that we wouldnt be here today and i say without the slightest remorse that we wouldnt be here we would not have made economic progress if we had not intervened on very personal matters who your neighbour is how you live the noise you make how you spit or what language you use we decide what is right never mind what the people think
1565721 at this rate the one man one vote system could lead to decline and disintegration
1565722 every election campaign starts off on a reasonable note then in order to get the crowds excited they make more and more brazen scurrilous wild accusations
1565723 the party would withdraw services to the two opposition held seats of anson and potong pasir
1565724 im prepared to banter with you im prepared to humour you but if this were an orwellian society with an orwellian leader would we be having this conversation
1565725 even from my sick bed even if you are going to lower me into the grave and i feel something is going wrong i will get up
1565726 with few exceptions democracy has not brought good government to new developing countries what asians value may not necessarily be what americans or europeans value westerners value the freedoms and liberties of the individual as an asian of chinese cultural backround my values are for a government which is honest effective and efficient
1565727 in america itself after 30 years of experimenting with the great society programmes there is widespread crime and violence children kill each other with guns neigbourhoods are insecure old people feel forgotten families are falling apart and the media attacks the integrity and character of your leaders with impunity drags down all those in authority and blames everyone but itself
1565728 i have visited burma and i know that there is only one instrument of government and that is the army if i were aung san suu kyi i think id rather be behind a fence and be a symbol than after two or three years be found impotent
1565729 between being loved and being feared i have always believed machiavelli was right if nobody is afraid of me im meaningless
1565730 mine is a very matter of fact approach to the problem if you can select a population and theyre educated and theyre properly brought up then you dont have to use too much of the stick because they would already have been trained its like with dogs you train it in a proper way from small it will know that its got to leave go outside to pee and to defecate no we are not that kind of society we had to train adult dogs who even today deliberately urinate in the lifts
1565731 supposing catherine lim was writing about me and not the prime minister she would not dare right because my posture my response has been such that nobody doubts that if you take me on i will put on knuckle dusters and catch you in a cul de sac anybody who decides to take me on needs to put on knuckle dusters if you think you can hurt me more than i can hurt you try there is no other way you can govern a chinese society
1565732 supposing im now 21 22 what would i do i would not be absorbed in wanting to change life in singapore im not responsible for singapore why should i go and undertake this job and spend my whole life pushing this for a lot of people for whom nothing is good enough i will have a fall back position which many are doing have a house in perth or vancouver or sydney or an apartment in london in case i need some place suddenly and think about whether i go on to america
1565733 what people mean by consultation is an imitation of what they see in america pressure groups and lobby groups its an unthinking adoption of western practices of development without any pruning and modification to suit our circumstances
1565734 the bell curve is a fact of life the blacks on average score 85 per cent on iq and it is accurate nothing to do with culture the whites score on average 100 asians score more the bell curve authors put it at least 10 points higher these are realities that if you do not accept will lead to frustration because you will be spending money on wrong assumptions and the results cannot follow
1565735 i started off believing all men were equal i now know thats the most unlikely thing ever to have been because millions of years have passed over evolution people have scattered across the face of this earth been isolated from each other developed independently had different intermixtures between races peoples climates soils i didnt start off with that knowledge but by observation reading watching arguing asking that is the conclusion ive come to
1565736 put it this way as long as jeyaretnam workers party leader stands for what he stands for a thoroughly destructive force we will knock him there are two ways of playing this one a you attack the policies two you attack the system jeyaretnam was attacking the system he brought the chief justice into it if i want to fix you do i need the chief justice to fix you everybody knows that in my bag i have a hatchet and a very sharp one you take me on i take my hatchet we meet in the cul de sac thats the way i had to survive in the past thats the way the communists tackled me he brought the chief justice into the political arena
1565737 if you cant think because you cant chew try a banana
1565738 he picked up from me a certain way of thinking certain logic certain cut of mind he has got from his mother a facility with words and a certain intuition
1565739 i ignore polling as a method of government i think that shows a certain weakness of mind an inability to chart a course whichever way the wind blows whichever way the media encourages the people to go you follow you are not a leader
1565740 political reform need not go hand in hand with economic liberalisation i do not believe that if you are libertarian full of diverse opinions full of competing ideas in the market place full of sound and fury therefore you will succeed
1565741 if i have to shoot 200 000 students to save china from another 100 years of disorder so be it
1565742 because i dont use it so much therefore it gets disused and theres language loss then i have to revive it its a terrible problem because learning it at adult life it hasnt got the same roots in your memory
1565743 at the end of the day we are so many digits in the machine the point is are these digits stronger than the competitors digits
1565744 when i call a man openly youre a liar youre dishonest and you do not dare to sue me theres something basically wrong and i will repeat it anywhere and you cant go and say oh i have apologised lets move on can you commit a dishonourable maybe even one which is against the law an illegal act and say lets move on because ive apologised you may move on but youre going to move on out of politics in time
1565745 please do not assume that you can change governments young people dont understand this
1565746 without the elected president and if there is a freak result within two or three years the army would have to come in and stop it
1565747 that was the year the british decided to get out and sell everything so i immediately held an election i knew the people will be dead scared
1565748 low salaries will draw in the hypocrites who sweet talk their way into power in the name of public service but once in charge will show their true colour and ruin the country
1565749 you know the cure for all this talk is really a good dose of incompetent government you get that alternative and youll never put singapore together again humpty dumpty cannot be put together again and your asset values will disappear your apartment will be worth a fraction of what it is your jobs will be in peril your security will be at risk and our women will become maids in other peoples countries foreign workers
1565750 when youre singapore and your existence depends on performance extraordinary performance better than your competitors when that performance disappears because the system on which its been based becomes eroded then youve lost everything i try to tell the younger generation that and they say the old man is playing the same record weve heard it all before i happen to know how we got here and i know how we can unscramble it
1565751 oh i didnt know that there was a seminar oh well
1565752 oh ill have to ask the head of the subject about that
1565753 he had ambitions and he worked very hard to get through college he was just a very well liked kid who had a lot of charm and possibilities
1565754 we need to find out all the responsible parties hopefully not only will we find justice for this family that has suffered these horrible losses but also make sure steps are taken to make sure this doesnt happen to somebody else
1565755 i want to know what happened what was the particular incident that caused my sons death

1565757 what i loved about fidm is that every one of my instructors was in the beauty industry fidm supports you not only in your education but afterwards in your career
1565758 if you dont know fit and you dont know patterns youre not a designer specialize in something and know the basics
1565759 fidm is one of the best known fashion colleges in the world they have the best connections its very expensive but what you get in return is
1565760 and a lot of contacts i got my first job on gilmore girls through my connections at fidm
1565761 whenever i need an intern or a production assistant i call fidm

1565774 were sitting on the fence waiting out the storm we are very patient developers and we want this project to sell out quickly right now the project is literally collecting dust i havent thought about it at all for the last four months

1565786 itll fester no matter what i do some wounds can never be cleaned out i didnt understand before but now i do he wandered away people do you know they get lost
1565787 we continue to move forward with logistics amp planning for this exciting project

1565789 i thought you wanted to go to the beach before it got dark
1565790 i do but weve been driving all day i just want to lay down for a little bit
1565791 the head of every man is christ the head of woman is man and the head of christ is god
1565792 for man is not from woman but woman from man 9 nor was man created for the woman but woman for the man 10 for this reason the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels
1565793 it was just a cultural thing for that time only and so it doesnt apply today
1565794 the head of every man is christ the head of woman is man and the head of christ is god
1565795 for man is not from woman but woman from man 9 nor was man created for the woman but woman for the man 10 for this reason the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels
1565796 well if its saying that women need to cover today then it needs to be a full veil covering the whole face
1565797 well if you want to wear a head covering then fine but we cant become legalistic about it
1565798 when people find something in the bible they dont like they call it legalism
1565799 if anyone seems to be contentious we have no such custom nor do the churches of god
1565800 and keep the traditions just as i delivered them to you
1565801 therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught whether by word or our epistle
1565802 but we command you brethren in the name of our lord jesus christ
1565803 7 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head since he is the image and glory of god but woman is the glory of man 8 for man is not from woman but woman from man 9 nor was man created for the woman but woman for the man 10 for this reason the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels 11 nevertheless neither is man independent of woman nor woman independent of man in the lord 12 for as woman came from man even so man also comes through woman but all things are from god
1565804 though the many authors differ on various issues associated with headcoverings one important issue upon which they are all agreed is that paul was not commanding the women in corinth either to let their hair grow long so as to use their long hair as a headcovering in worship or to neatly place their hair upon their heads as a headcovering in worship but rather to place upon their heads a fabric headcovering when they worship before the lord
1565805 the standpoint of the dutch government is clear when legal certificates are made up in one part of the kingdom and that also includes marriage certificates these are according to article 40 of the kingdom statute also valid in the entire kingdom

1565828 so if they want to stay here and work during the august rece david m herszenhorn
1565829 both have this nuanced on the one hand and on the other hand need to explain position and i think that makes it difficult for either to take a stand
1565830 bottom line is i think that both candidates feel squeezed so the best approach is to talk about the economy
1565831 the senator so far has not been a candidate who motivates the grassroots
1565832 but these issues motivate the grassroots and will get the people in churches and people who care about these issues not only out to vote but hopefully bringing their friends along
1565833 we felt the vote totals reported by yahoo did not reflect all the votes that should have been cast
1565834 we asked broadridge financial to double check the votes transmitted to yahoo on our behalf
1565835 it was just in this one incident with one investor and did not change the outcome of this election
1565836 he spent the rest of his life becoming an expert on transportation and transportation policy
1565837 was a major force in negotiating prices and policies with the railroads and the old interstate commerce commission
1565838 he never got riled never got ruffled and he was an extremely logical and caring man
1565839 i think its wrong to allow adoptions of children by gay and lesbian couples
1565840 i still think that there ought to be ways for us to provide a loving environment for children without sending a wrong message to them early or a message that we have to sit down and try to explain some psychological damage or emotional damage or something later on in life
1565841 i think that lesbianism and homosexuality is morally wrong and the laws supposed to discriminate sometimes
1565842 i want my voice to be heard i am offended shouldnt i have the right to voice my opinion and to take my young daughter to the public library without concern that she will choose a book that promotes gay marriage a view that is a slap in my face
1565843 does anybody out there hear me where are all of the other moms who are willing to stand up for their beliefs if you are then get up call the library call the governor call anybody do something
1565844 she does not have the right to insist that no one will express an opinion contrary to hers or that people wont write books that she disagrees with or that such books will somehow be hidden or made more difficult to find
1565845 it makes me unhappy that anyone would object to my book enough to want to remove it from library shelves
1565846 someone posted a review on amazon and said they threw the book away and that makes me sad too
1565847 im very very touched by the many people who have posted on message boards and the comment sections after online articles supporting the book and fighting for it i wrote the book for people i love it is in every way an expression of family love i truly dont think theres anything in it that any child shouldnt see
1565848 how long did it take you to write the book how did you draw them so cute is the little white mouse a baby is the white one at the wedding a boy how did you make their clothes were you ever a flower girl in a wedding and that was it
1565849 marriage is a covenant between a man and a woman as stated in the websters dictionary and also in the bible
1565850 and clearly exposure to this book or several doesnt just overthrow that parental influence
1565851 most of the books we have are designed not to interfere with parents notions of how to raise their children but to support them but not every parent is looking for the same thing
1565852 it would still do her well to harbor a tolerance for the choices of others
1565853 perhaps we should follow the views of another man i am reminded of who believed in love your neighbor as yourself jesus christ as a heterosexual married mother with straight and gay friends i choose to practice acceptance of others and not intolerance be assured that i will call everybody i will vote and i will do something
1565854 already we can predict how the ala next year will complain about any objection to a book called uncle bobbys wedding
1565855 the ala doesnt favor open discussion and debate with parents which is what the challenges represent its idea of freedom is emboldening librarians to be brave enough to indoctrinate children with what they really need to know whether their parents object or even know about it
1565856 i believe that every book in the childrens area particularly in the area where usually the parent is reading the book aloud involves parental guidance
1565857 if the library is doing its job there are lots of books in our collection that people wont agree with there are certainly many that i object to library collections dont imply endorsement they imply access to the many different ideas of our culture which is precisely our purpose in public life

1565882 pemilik kartu kredit bermasalah tidak perlu lagi takut itu bisa diatasi dengan mudah seberat apa pun masalahnya saya akan membantu untuk bisa diselesaikan dengan cara yang saling menguntungkan bukan dengan saling merugikan
1565883 tapi celakanya bank bank tidak pernah menyampaikan atau menyosialisasikan program rescheduling bila pemegang kartu menghadapi kesulitan dengan uang muka sekian persen untuk waktu sekian bulan ini menyesatkan dan memberatkan
1565884 karena sesungguhnya dana yang diterima pemegang kartu sama sekali bukan dana dari bank penerbit kartu tersebut tetapi berasal dari master atau visa jadi tidak ada alasan lagi bank penerbit kartu untuk menolak permohonan kartu kredit apabila ada yang mengajukan permohonan membayar sesuai dengan kemampuannya toh visa dan master sudah mendapat klaim asuransi dan kemacetan mediasi inilah yang saya lakukan selama ini

1565897 i dont speak chinese so i couldnt understand what they were doing or saying they just made me sit there i could not make a phone call it was unbelievable
1565898 we heard that the chinese side pointed out that it is forbidden to film military facilities and it seems like there was confusion because the scene of the assault was just 50 metres yards from a military facility

1565903 she was three to four years old she had straight dark brown hair in a ponytail her hair reached her shoulders or possibly a little further she had a pallid face and huge eyes which were very noticeable
1565904 she had a dark look but i dont think she had dark brown eyes i think they were green brown what caught my attention was the fact that she showed little or no emotion
1565905 then the little girl stood before me and asked me in english do you know where my mummy is i answered that her mother was a little bit further back in the shop and she answered she is not my mummy
1565906 i asked her who the woman was and she said she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
1565907 i still remember that because i thought it was a rare name i then asked her where she had last seen her mother and she answered they took me from my holiday

1565931 it is this exercise of pushing the stone up the hill a sisyphean endeavor at times where you do make two steps up and one step back sometimes you make one step up and two steps back but over the last year or so from the large comprehensive offensive launched in june 2007 when we had all of the surge brigades on the ground since that time there has been a fairly steady degree of improvement

1565941 i dont think we can keep control of violent prisoners by calling them by their first name

1565982 there is a strong indication of pollution from the industrial sector out of the five plants located in ancol areas three of them are located close to the sea the three plants have disposal pipes leading to the ancol sea
1565983 that information came from the fishermen and we believe them because they are very experienced with the condition of the sea when i pulled the anchor there is a kind of brownish and oily residue which sticks to the anchor according to the fisherfolk that is the residue of the plants waste which are left at the bottom of the sea

1566022 but when it comes to our nations veterans senator mccain has consistently turned his back on them its time for john mccain to explain his weak record on veterans care and abandon his suggestion to ration va health care benefits americans have already had eight years of a president who has turned his back on our veterans and we dont want four more years with john mccain
1566023 we need to concentrate our efforts to handle those wounds and disabilities that are directly the result of combat
1566024 so heres my idea and its not originated with me but ive consulted with so many others who are here look we need to concentrate our efforts to handle those wounds and those disabilities that are directly the result of combat we need to expand our ability to treat ptsd ptsd is going to be tough in this war you know that and we need to treat the combat wounds we need to increase that ability to do so
1566025 these wars are the first to be waged in large numbers by a new generation of brave women but 15 percent of our women soldiers that served on the front lines who walk into a va facility screen positive for military sexual trauma is senator mccain suggesting that we cant afford to give them benefits senator mccains campaign did not return calls for comment about his statement but these arequestions he must answer all veterans respect john mccains service if he too respects ours the our soldiers with non combat injuries who have served with such honor and dignity
1566026 the bush administration and sen john mccain for that matter initially opposed passage of the legislation which was supported overwhelmingly by both democrats and republicans mccain campaigning last week used language suggesting he supported the bill in fact mccain did not even cast a vote on the final measure for bush and mccain to try to claim credit now for a bipartisan effort they both opposed is a plain attempt to hoodwink the american voter
1566027 under the webb bill veterans would receive maximum educational benefits after 36 months of service and those benefits would be tied to the full cost of public school tuition and expenses in the veterans home state the graham bill would require 12 years of service to garner a maximum benefit of 2000 per month with increases in that figure tied to the consumer price index critics point out that the cpi has been steadily outpaced by tuition increases
1566028 my proposal and others senator graham senator burn is well place incentives for people to stay in the military
1566029 yes the more you get because we want people to stay in we have to increase the benefits for the men and women who are serving and motivate those to serve

1566128 it all would be quite funny if many people didnt seem to be inhaling this multimedia stink bomb as if it were fragrant truth
1566129 there is a sense that because of his unique background and temperament obama lives apart
1566130 has been called distant aloof and somewhat unapproachable perhaps because we cannot approach what he does not have a solid core his soul seems to be molten and made up of dreams which is at once breathtakingly inspiring and forbiddingly indeterminate when this young man with the flowing passionate core

1566176 dan kau sibuk pula sering ke luar kota ke luar negeri juga terpikir olehku nak masih punya waktu kalian buat cucu cucuku
1566177 aku cuma khawatir cucuku si aya sudah gadis bukan sudah smp jangan pula dia alami seperti keponakanmu aida

1566182 tetapi bagiku nak yang benar harus disampaikan sekalipun pahit kalaupun akibatnya kau diberhentikan bekerja dipecat partaimu bagiku itu lebih baik daripada kau berkhianat pada kebenaran pada hatimu sendiri juga kepada tuhan dan negeri ini yang sedikit banyak ikut dibela ayahmu dari penjajah

1566185 the section 271 e 1 safe harbor does not immunize the osa from infringement
1566186 in short innova is not a party seeking fda approval for a product in order to enter the market to compete with patentees because the osa device is not subject to fda premarket approval and therefore faces no regulatory barriers to market entry upon patent expiration innova is not a party who prior to enactment of the hatch waxman act could be said to have been adversely affected by the second distortion for this reason we do not think congress could have intended that the safe harbor of section 271 e 1 apply to it put another way insofar as its osa device is concerned innova is not within the category of entities for whom the safe harbor provision was designed to provide relief we thus agree with the district court that innova is not entitled to the benefit of the section 271 e 1 safe harbor

1566195 with the constant pressure to be more efficient and to innovate it makes little sense to waste countless collective hours commuting so the most efficient and productive regions are the ones in which people are thinking and working not sitting in traffic and according to detailed research by the nobel prize winning economist daniel kahneman commuting is among the least enjoyable if not the single least enjoyable of all human activities

1566197 in the past strategic investments in our nations transportation infrastructure the railroads in the 19th century the interstates in the 20th turbocharge growth and transformed the country but more recently americas transportation infrastructure has not kept pace with the growth and evolution of its economy at the precise time when the nation desperately needs to prioritize its limited investments and resources the federal transportation program has lost focus
1566198 we have to keep pace with demands for public transit and give this country a reason to be proud of its high speed trains light rail lines and both rapid and conventional bus transit we need to make more of our streets safe and convenient for walking and biking to work school shops and transit stops we have to create incentives for developers to invest in our close in suburbs and urban centers to meet the huge demand for affordable homes in convenient locations americans are not dumb we would much rather invest in well located real estate than in gasoline we are tired of feeling like victims whether of oil companies poor planning or a lack of vision we are ready for innovative change if only our leaders will follow us

1566204 your transportation plan is built around a sales tax and must be approved by voters at the ballot but it seems that throughout the nation with the exception of a few major cities asking people to drive less and consider other modes of transportation has not worked very well thats why we see this pandering from senators clinton and mccain on lifting the gas tax is mass transit a losing issue

1566226 pastikan bahwa cangkir itu sendiri tidak mempengaruhi kualitas kopi dalam banyak kasus itu hanya lebih mahal dan dalam beberapa kasus bahkan menyembunyikan apa yang kita minum apa yang kalian inginkan sebenarnya adalah kopi bukanlah cangkirnya namun kalian secara sadar mengambil cangkir terbaik dan kemudian mulai memperhatikan cangkir orang lain
1566227 sekarang perhatikan hal ini kehidupan bagai kopi sedangkan pekerjaan uang dan posisi dalam masyarakat adalah cangkirnya cangkir bagaikan alat untuk memegang dan mengisi kehidupan jenis cangkir yang kita miliki tidak mendefinisikan atau juga mengganti kualitas kehidupan yang kita hidupi seringkali karena berkonsentrasi hanya pada cangkir kita gagal untuk menikmati kopi yang tuhan sediakan bagi kita

1566237 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
1566238 safe injecting sites are not a new intervention but simply a repackaging of existing who recommended interventions such as needle exchanges etc
1566239 they enable known who recommended harm reduction interventions to be delivered and used in a safe environment with the aim of reaching the most marginalized and vulnerable of injecting drug users
1566240 canada is proud to be the largest contributor to the who
1566241 we need to stop arguing about the merits of harm reduction and just do it
1566242 it may seem like they are legalizing heroin and other drugs which they are not

1566249 additionally under governor pawlentys supervision his administration is actively promoting the indoctrination of students into a homosexual worldview and value system
1566250 the end game in all of this is a legal imposition of homosexual marriage upon the state of minnesota

1566252 nowhere in the legislation are the rights and interests of the born or unborn child mentioned in regard to anything
1566253 the bill also fails in any manner to recognize or protect the life and rights of the unborn child

1566279 this is stunning you have a rare ability to find sensitive moments in some very insensitive situations what a talent
1566280 incredible not just because they are excellent photographs but because they are frighteningly honest i hope you continue to make these strong thought provoking records and that you stay safe in what must be incredibly difficult situations both physically and emotionally
1566281 it would be somewhat of an understatement to say i was impressed with your work we obviously know how dangerous it is to be involved in that theater iraq im sure that every moment of every day is just on the verge of chaotic for what is that war war if not the ultimate of chaos and yet you have these moments where you pause to compose image of graphic quality equal to content admire all you compositional skills but am especially taken by the wideangle work do your best to do so and know youre held in high esteem
1566282 i have to confess that i couldnt sleep properly after seeing your photos the first time these images are still in my mind and wont let me go

1566284 into the very depths of my soul i cannot begin to even sum up with words the depths of how your images reach out to me it brings me down to earth and reminds me as to why i picked up the camera in the first place your works are truly inspiring youre very privileged to have to see these places with your own eyes observe and capture through your lens the true state of the world we live in as for now for me itll have to be through your eyes your pictures and the stories they tell truly honored
1566285 there is a hunger to know the truth about war and your accurate presentation of it is exemplary i dont believe it possible to be unmoved by your images this is especially true for those of us who live in a very different world essentially free from the suffering and carnage you portray thank you for your dedication and courage you are making and incredible contribution to world understanding hopefully not at an extreme cost to yourself war photography seems like a hard way to make a living on many levels living and breathing civilian trauma is not easy but it is more localized you can get away from it by driving or moving to another location but with war there is no escape the reality is so harsh and overwhelmingly pervasive into all areas of life stay safe many will be following you
1566286 thanks zoriah for your hard work and incredible vision and for the inspiration your example lends to others who have put down the gun or never carried one

1566307 superb photojournalistic images you have in your gallery compels me to comment on almost each one let them speak for themselves because they really dont need comments they yet deserve to be deeply appreciated for all their quality hope to see more of your fantastic work soon
1566308 ive often tried to express this practice but a photo is worth more than my words
1566309 ive always thought that photographs are a kind of self portrait of the photographer
1566310 your work is amazingly powerful some hard to look at but gripping nonetheless
1566311 ive seen many war photos and met a few war photographers but zoriahs work deeply touched me
1566312 simply excelent its a great reportage of a difficult situation
1566313 deserves to take a well earned place in history in the company of phillip jones griffith don mc cullen larry burrows and robert capa the minimal presentation of his work is perfect the viewer fills in the details and the images linger stubbornly in the memory to awake one from sleep in a cold sweat these images cannot be taken in in one viewing the viewer returns restlessly again and again attempting to process the information this is really happening iconic compelling images of war by a true professional i take my hat off to him
1566314 a chilling commentary on the madness of war all war
1566315 the worlds cruelty compressed into some thousand pixels its so impressive
1566316 right up there with robert capa wonderful work you should be with magnum you are showing all sides of the conflict
1566317 what you are doing is so so important i cannot even contemplate what horror and pain you have seen but see it we must true dedication and bravery is the only way to expose such inhumanity keep truth as your motto and maybe this silly world we live in will someday wake up and treat people as living souls not simply pieces of meat to be traded in worthless pointless conflicts i salute you sir
1566318 his commitment to photojournalism can not be denied i am certain he will secure a place amongst some of our best
1566319 i am awed by these images some rank among the best millitary images ive ever seen and ive collected all the greats
1566320 i am in awe i really dont know what to say i havent been this affected since i saw nachtweys work
1566321 it is a eye opener to view your work it brings strong emotions when doing so your work reflects another side of the world around us and beyond i will use it to find inspiration for myself thanks for sharing these pictures with us
1566322 amazing difficult to stomach i am very emotional but just brilliant and captivating thanks for sharing all your photos
1566323 just because someone doesnt love you the way you want them to it doesnt mean they arent loving you the best way they know how
1566324 the truth has a great capacity to offend and injure and you will find that the closer you are to someone the more care you must take to disguise or even conceal the truth often there is great virtue in being evasive or equivocating there is also great skill any child can blurt out the truth without thought to the consequences it takes great maturity to appreciate the value of silence
1566325 old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1566326 n o o o i like you like you are now more
1566327 no grandma when you come over i just do a little dance cause im so happy to see you
1566328 sen specter remains the most respected statewide public official in pennsylvania
1566329 but his age 78 and health problems could make him vulnerable to a challenge from hardballs chris matthews
1566330 theoretical match up there is a large undecided vote and many voters dont know enough about matthews to have an opinion
1566331 his contract at msnbc is up in 2009 and chris spent an extraordinary amount of time in pennsylvania before the democratic presidential primary in april
1566332 i think hes testing the political waters when asked by various reporters he hasnt ruled out running he hasnt taken it off the table
1566333 would chris be the strongest democrat on the board right now probably because of his celebrity and knowledge of politics
1566334 but he has a lifestyle decision to make first and foremost
1566335 certainly presents a very interesting scenario given his appeal and his knowledge of washington
1566336 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1566337 im thinking rihanna ill see you at the white house oh and i might paint it pink i hope thats cool with you guys
1566338 im paris hilton and i approve this message because i think its totally hot
1566339 its been going on since ive been with the department going on 29 years
1566340 i dare say it will probably be going on 30 years from now
1566341 during a typical june july and august when most of the seasonal campers are here and most folks are trying to get use out of their boats and water skis and we can control the low water we shouldnt let it drop to a point where boating navigation becomes a dangerous safety issue
1566342 raising the water 7 inches would saturate a lot of the wetlands we have today and make the regeneration process very difficult and would start to diminish that
1566343 if a guy wants to come in and take his chances
1566344 if they cant come in on their own the idea of subsidizing them what are you getting
1566345 its not a slam dunk that someone will go if demoulas comes into gloucester cossing
1566346 they can be open a lot sooner at gloucester crossing
1566347 i dont know if it will have impact on the other supermarkets
1566348 peace peace he is not dead he doth not sleep he hath awakened from the dream of life
1566349 the aim of the review is to make the system simpler and to make it more efficient but im not going to buy into the means by which we do that
1566350 it will not be my task in this process as we go through it to rule some things in and to be ruling things out
1566351 mr costello has made not one valuable structure change in the australian economy in the 12 years he was treasurer
1566352 hes a guy without imagination and he is a guy without courage
1566353 that point was proven by the fact he let howard stay there for so long
1566354 its a liberal party so bereft of talent that they have go to such a low grade performer as costello to come back as their leader
1566355 that id made up my mind to find that great redeeming idea diotima wants and lay it at her feet it turns out that there are lots of great ideas but only one of them can be the only logical isnt it so its a matter of putting them in order you said yourself that this is a resolve worthy of a napoleon right you even gave me a number of excellent suggestions as was to be expected of you but i never got the point of using them in short i have to go about it my own way
1566356 partly because of a boys natural admiration for the criminal and partly because his teachers had made a point of calling this tyrant who had tried to turn europe upside down the greatest evildoer in history
1566357 napoleons genius began to develop only after he became a general
1566358 a form of philosophizing that is essayistic rather than systematic a recognition of art as a form of intellectual exploration
1566359 the essay takes its form and method from science and its matter from art
1566360 an essay is rather the unique and unalterable form assumed by a mans inner life in decisive thought nothing is more foreign to it than the irresponsible and half baked quality of thought known as subjectivism terms like true and false wise and unwise are equally inapplicable and yet the essay is subject to laws that are no less strict for appearing to be delicate and ineffable there have been more than a few such essayists masters of the inner hovering life but there would be no point in naming them a man who wants the truth becomes a scholar a man who wants to give free play to his subjectivity may become a writer but what should a man do who wants something in between
1566361 wasnt i just telling clarisse something about water he mused but could not recall the particulars but it didnt really matter his thoughts roamed idly unfortunately nothing is so hard to achieve as a literary representation of a man thinking
1566362 one of the foremost rules for a good general is to find the enemys strength
1566363 so i asked them to get me a card to our world famous imperial library and with the help of a librarian who very charmingly put himself at my disposal when i told him who i was i have now penetrated the enemys lines
1566364 no place affords a more striking conviction of the vanity of human hopes than a public library for who can see the wall crowded on every side by mighty volumes the works of laborious meditations and accurate inquiry now scarcely known but by the catalogue
1566365 progress has ordered things so that all citizens not just the prophets may give themselves the luxury of preaching in the desert
1566366 i felt nailed to the spot the whole world seemed to be one enormous practical joke and im telling you even though im feeling a bit calmer about it theres something radically wrong somewhere
1566367 you may say it isnt necessary to read every last book
1566368 it occurred to me you see that the fellow lives among these millions of books he knows each one he knows where to find them he ought to be able to help me
1566369 oh all sorts of things i said as if he were prying into state secrets i was playing for time
1566370 i only meant what subject or what author he asked is it military history
1566371 oh no i said more on the lines of the history of peace
1566372 the intersection of science and literature in robert musils pdf that
1566373 theological ethics too i said but it would have to include something about our old austrian culture and a bit about grillparzer i specified
1566374 the maltreatment and persecution of an underdog by a superior
1566375 his appearance gives no clue to what his profession might be and yet he doesnt look like a man without a profession either when he is angry something in him laughs when he is sad he is up to something when something moves him he turns against it hell always see the good side to every bad action what he thinks of anything will always depend on some possible context nothing is to him what it is everything is subject to change in flux part of a whole of an infinite number of wholes presumably adding up to a superwhole that however he knows nothing about
1566376 just a moment sir i cried you cant leave me here without telling me your secret how you manage to im afraid i let slip the word madhouse because thats how i suddenly felt about it
1566377 reading is first and foremost non reading even in the case of the most passionate lifelong readers the act of picking up and opening a book masks the countergesture that occurs at the same time the involuntary act of not picking up and not opening all the other books in the universe
1566378 rather than any particular book it is indeed these connections and correlations that should be the focus of the cultivated individual a nd musils image of the brain powerfully underscores this theory that relations among ideas are far more important than the ideas themselves you could quibble with the librarians claim not to read any books since he takes a close interest in the books about books known as catalogs but these have a rather particular status and in fact amount to no more than lists they are also a visual manifestation of the relations among books relations that should be of keen interest to anyone who truly cares about books who loves them enough to want to master all of them at once
1566379 so i said trying to catch my breath you never read a single book
1566380 i must admit that when he left me there alone after that i felt like doing one of two things bursting into tears or lighting a cigarette neither of which i was allowed to do there
1566381 whats wrong with the traditional method of starting a book on the first page and reading through to the end
1566382 its important to know how to read from the first line to the last line but there are also other ways of reading you can skim books you can just have heard about them you can have read them and forgotten them
1566383 feel an end to my loneliness of course just as you
1566384 well i said be that as it may my friend it still isnt so simple for me to tell you what im looking for
1566385 now what do you think of that you could have knocked me over like a feather and when the old fellow caught on he just went and fetched all the books diotima has on reserve there so now when i come to the library its practically like a secret mystical marriage now and then i make a discreet pencil mark in the margin or i write a word in and i know shell see it the very next day and she wont have a clue who it is thats there inside her own head when she wonders whats going on
1566386 the inventor of many arts such as arithmetic and calculation and geometry and astronomy and draughts and dice but his great discovery was the use of letters
1566387 this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners souls because they will not use their memories they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves your letters are an aid not to memory but to reminiscence and you give your disciples not truth but only the semblance of truth they will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing they will be tiresome company having the show of wisdom without the reality
1566388 writing reading editing printing distributing cataloging reviewing can be fuel for that conversation ways of keeping it lively it could even be said that to publish a book is to insert it into the middle of that conversation that to establish a publishing house bookstore or library is to start a conversation a conversation that springs as it should from local debate but that opens up as it should to all places and times
1566389 now brace yourself and give me your full attention because im going to ask you something
1566390 the history of the same of that which for a given culture is both dispersed and related therefore to be distinguished by kinds and to be collected together into identities
1566391 order is at one and the same time that which is given in things as their inner law the hidden network that determines the way they confront one another and also that which has no existence except in the grid created by a glance an examination a language and it is only in the blank spaces of this grid that order manifests itself in depth as though already there waiting in silence for the moment of its expression
1566392 i discussed that with my library attendant he suggested i read kant or somebody all about the limits of ideas and perceptions but frankly i dont want to go on reading i have a funny feeling that i now understand why those of us in the army where we have the highest degree of order also have to be prepared to lay down our lives at any moment i cant exactly explain why somehow or other order once it reaches a certain stage calls for bloodshed and now i am honestly worried that your cousin is carrying all her efforts too far to the point where she is likely to go and do something that might do her a lot of harm and ill be less able than ever to help her do you see what i mean diotimas pursuit of an idea that will bring about human unity is a paradox of order in unifying all you identify none the parallel campaigns mission results in either paralysis or laughter were either ordered rigid as the general describes or were smiling at the futility of the effort as musil suggests thats the truth of bringing order to all it cant be done but the human desire for it is neither stiff nor violent in our quest for a more unifying order we silence those whove ordered against us the deeper and more secure our identities become the clearer and less secure those with whom we do not identify appear writing in the midst of two world wars musil may have sensed this the generals concern that the outcome of a political action group searching for a totalizing order will be bloodshed is not misguided as for the arts and sciences and all they can offer in terms of great and admirable ideas of course i have nothing but the greatest respect for all that i wouldnt dream of saying anything against it
1566393 i treat life as something unpleasant that one can get through by smoking
1566394 child molesters and dead beat dads i mean really how much of a stripper and prostitute shortage would there be without these guys
1566395 its a little freaky because you feel like living in stroudsburg youre shielded away from anything like that that can happen and that happening across the street really freaks me out gives me a different outlook on how to carry myself walking through this neighborhood now
1566396 outrage sadness this used to be a pretty quiet neighborhood it would be safe you can tell that no one is safe anymore

1566506 if i wanted to do that why wouldnt i just stay there that seat doesnt expire until the end of 2010
1566507 the reason i applied was every day since i resigned people have come up to me my wife and a lot of other people and said judge we wish you were still on the bench
1566508 people may think i look like im hedging my bets or keeping my options open but these are both public service positions i dont see it as a bad thing to be a legislator or a judge if i cant be a legislator id like to be a judge
1566509 im sure that bob murphy will do whatever he feels is appropriate
1566510 raises serious questions about whether democrats believe murphy can be competitive in the race
1566511 theyve hit the panic button and theyve come out with all kinds of nutty stuff
1566512 oh and you can help swell the ranks of one of the finest secular organizations out there as well as being able to proudly tell everyone that you belong to a national humanist association thanks to phil plait new president of jref
1566513 i was walking home looking for my keys and realized my pocket wasnt as heavy as it used to be
1566514 as soon as he said it was lost and lost on the t we were making plans to replace his id and kiss his cash goodbye

1566518 we are disappointed to see that delta now appears to have chosen a different approach with its regional airline partners
1566519 our tolerance is not like it has been in the past
1566520 there are expectations on what the product will look like at mainline and regionals weve been aggressive in making sure everyone understands the expectations
1566521 i felt like i had the flu i didnt think anything much about it
1566522 its a non itchy rash that clears in the center
1566523 so it looks like a bullseye that may or may not be accompanied by flu like symptoms
1566524 so when you have high humidity and the grass is growing from a lot of rain youll have lots of ticks
1566525 oh they love it every time we give them something they just keep coming for more
1566526 when we do have the camera crews out here its usually for a murder or a robbery or negative coverage
1566527 i thought it would be a good opportunity to see that were more than just that here in this neighborhood
1566528 the kids are having so much fun and the grownups are having fun too
1566529 i mean this is what its all about the neighborhood coming together and having a great time
1566530 we look forward to witnessing sony music entertainments exciting future under sonys ownership
1566531 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1566532 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1566533 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1566534 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1566535 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1566536 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1566537 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1566538 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1566539 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1566540 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1566541 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1566542 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1566543 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1566544 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1566545 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1566546 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1566547 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1566548 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1566549 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1566550 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1566551 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1566552 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1566553 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1566554 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1566555 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1566556 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

1566559 in a very low tone of voice indicated that he is guilty
1566560 this is a serious matter and you should have the opportunity to speak to a lawyer
1566561 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1566562 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1566563 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1566564 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1566565 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1566566 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1566567 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1566568 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1566569 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1566570 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1566571 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1566572 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1566573 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1566574 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1566575 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1566576 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1566577 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1566578 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1566579 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1566580 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1566581 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1566582 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1566583 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1566584 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1566585 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1566586 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1566587 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1566588 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1566589 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1566590 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1566591 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1566592 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1566593 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1566594 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1566595 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1566596 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1566597 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1566598 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1566599 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1566600 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1566601 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1566602 who are open to doing something on the production side
1566603 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1566604 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1566605 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1566606 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1566607 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1566608 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1566609 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1566610 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1566611 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1566612 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1566613 for if you love those who love you what reward do you have and if you greet only your brothers what more are you doing than others you therefore must be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect
1566614 i believe this is the first time someone has resorted to texting
1566615 it is good and good to remind people that when a signal is too weak for voice communication you may still be able to communicate by text
1566616 when an engine is working of course its spinning the propeller at high speed and theres a lot of force behind the propeller so when it contacts trees on the ground the propeller and the trees will demonstrate how forceful that propeller strike is
1566617 a lot of it is consumed by fire and but there is significant components the engines propellers etcetera that we will be able to examine
1566618 this type of aircraft has a well documented reliable history we know the rcmp used to use this type of aircraft for a number of years and so did macmillan bloedel
1566619 all of these aircraft have to be maintained as though theyre brand new
1566620 these guys do this type of flying because they absolutely love aviation and they love this type of work
1566621 everybodys in shock its a great loss a range of emotions you know theyre all over the map
1566622 theyre just in a grieving period right now its a pretty small tight knit group of fellas theyve known each other for a number of years so were just allowing that to happen
1566623 were on stand down right now no one from that division is essentially working were not moving logs or participating at all
1566624 obviously everyone is pretty shaken up for a lot of our employees you know they were away for the long weekend and so a lot of them are just coming back in today and learning the news
1566625 he kept us in the game and thats whats important
1566626 one pitch different and he probably would have won the game but otherwise you cant ask for much more
1566627 i want to get in there a little more than i was overall i felt comfortable and calm and just tried to hit the glove as much as i could once again i worked from behind and it ended up hurting me a few times
1566628 but im just happy the guys are battling out there big time we had some hard hit balls in the ninth and they were coming through for us
1566629 being canadian i always watched major league baseball games watching for canadians looking for canadians cheering them on
1566630 its just i feel very proud to be canadian to get here its a tougher road for canadians we dont have all the access of baseball in america with high school and all that its a little bit more of a struggle especially in the baseball world everybody embraces that person that made it and cheers them on and hopes for the best im just really happy i can be one of those guys that people can cheer for
1566631 weve had a lot of great shortstops here and you can put him right there with him he has really showed me something here he has made play after play after play and he enjoys doing it too
1566632 i think our guys did a real good job of battling
1566633 even though we werent hitting the ball all game long the jays knew if we kept it close we could give ourselves a shot at the end its a big win for us
1566634 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1566635 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1566636 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1566637 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1566638 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1566639 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1566640 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1566641 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1566642 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1566643 everything went kind of sour a few weeks or a month back but you never felt like it would get to the point or to the talks of him actually being traded
1566644 i felt once he stepped back in here he would be the quarterback him not being here today i guess management has a different route so at that point weve got to go out and do our job
1566645 the autopsy is taking as long as it has just because of the nature of the injuries
1566646 im hearing a lot of third hand information which i can describe to you as disturbing but no one has contacted me and id like to speak first hand with all of these people
1566647 there have been suggestions that katelynn has been seen in the past with marks on her body
1566648 well thats weird because we have the power to give people shots
1566649 how weird would this be if we just work together
1566650 lets just trust each other and go to some pretty wacky places
1566651 im not going to make you look bad im going to make you look just bad enough
1566652 you always look cool in movies look dumb for a minute
1566653 how about like a kick ass soundtrack where all our dreams come true
1566654 well why dont we just get our idol huey lewis to do it
1566655 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1566656 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1566657 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1566658 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1566659 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1566660 if its laying there i can just reach and get it and put it down in my bag
1566661 she said i make money off them i said nuh uh then that first year i was top collector
1566662 shes very dedicated she gets others involved and she believes in it and she catches a lot of lightning bugs to help people
1566663 people say oh its embarrassing its embarrassing well youre just being a little bit of a kid

1566667 when i was in college i became friends with a beautiful call girl
1566668 i was a little put off by her profession at first but gradually i accepted her she loved sex she loved getting paid for it she was in charge of her life and who was i to judge her choices she taught me a lot about female sexuality that opened up my world
1566669 you are one of those women who make me realize that life isnt over when you get older women in their 50s and 60s have it going on now
1566670 some people have phobias of flying or not being able to afford the expense to go across sea and get one so were bringing it to them
1566671 the humane society of the united states sees canned hunting as one of the most egregious wildlife abuses that there is
1566672 theres nothing about this that is defined by hunting it violates every principal of fair chase and we feel like the facilities need to be stopped
1566673 certain members of the public and the news media are concerned about it i think a number of hunters are concerned about it and if theyre concerned about it were certainly concerned about it
1566674 people in east tennessee as well as the state of tennessee are great sportsmen and a lot of good hunters but i think they want it to be real and i dont want these animals to be walking around itd be just like a man that raises cattle and then going out and shooting one if his cows
1566675 i mean if theyre not running theyre not trying to get away wheres the sport

1566677 typically at the end of a market cycle you will see home prices remain flat or even come off a few percentage points a year until the next cycle begins
1566678 barring a complete deterioration in the provincial economy and mortgage interest rates climbing rapidly thats kind of what we see in terms of what market activity is showing us
1566679 were seeing more price reductions in properties listed on the market which is a levelling impact on the housing price increases experienced at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2008
1566680 buyers are now in the drivers seat in the fraser valley and were starting to see that reflected in home prices
1566681 theres not a lot of economic news out there right now that is going to bolster demand in a significant way that well see sales levels return to what they were
1566682 there is only so long that a market can continue on price increases
1566683 after youve gone three years with double digit price increases and even if the economy is moving along and interest rates remain low there is this sort of market exhaustion
1566684 in order to be more proactive we generated data that demonstrates that when treated the virus goes down in the blood but also in the semen and vaginal secretions and so forth
1566685 basically the more people you treat and the faster you engage people in treatment the greater impact you will have on the epidemic
1566686 all of these conspire against them being able to access treatment
1566687 when the construction is complete travel on the highway will be safer and more reliable for tourists residents and truckers
1566688 and there will be fewer traffic tie ups on this crucial national commercial transportation artery
1566689 upgrading the trans canada highway from coast to coast is one of our highest priorities
1566690 and todays announcement is an important step forward in that plan

1566692 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1566693 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1566694 theyve got a lot to do theyve got to show us a verification regime that we can trust
1566695 this is a step by step process i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1566696 of course behind those people there were those people who were sort of opposed but their numbers were limited
1566697 ours is a vital relationship and our three meetings will only strengthen the relationship i admire your forthrightness your integrity
1566698 it will help lift the korean economy up a level president bush and i promised to do our best to get it passed within this year
1566699 thats to be determined the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist
1566700 the north korean leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program
1566701 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list then the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1566702 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists
1566703 thats my hope for the sake of peace its my hope for the sake of our children
1566704 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1566705 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures

1566707 under normal circumstances if its raining anywhere the equestrian sport continues
1566708 i call upon the national olympic committees and international federations to be sure that we meet the deadline of compliance
1566709 i make an appeal to governments to accelerate the ratification of the unesco treaty
1566710 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1566711 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1566712 i felt a little bit embarrassed talking about doping when my country had not signed
1566713 wada will give every assistance for all stakeholders to be compliant by november
1566714 the real onus is on the countries and sports federations to ensure that the athletes who have been sent to beijing are clean
1566715 wada the ioc and bocog beijings organizing committee cannot guarantee that all athletes at the games will not try to dope
1566716 we can be sure however that anybody who dopes risks getting caught as the testing will be more frequent and significant than at any other olympic games
1566717 hes behind but well work to get him up to speed and we know hes the kind of player who will get himself caught up
1566718 right from the start through the draft and minicamps he has shown us things that are innate to successful nfl linebackers
1566719 i want to catch up quick on what i missed and move forward as fast as i can
1566720 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1566721 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1566722 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
1566723 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1566724 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1566725 of course i would have liked to have been there advocating for a peaceful resolution
1566726 under normal circumstances if its raining anywhere the equestrian sport continues
1566727 i cant tell you how thrilled i am for this years field these stunning women have the best breasts in the business with brains charm and style to boot with finalists like these picking one to vote on isnt going to be easy
1566728 working with digital playground is always a great experience in the past with drowning pool and now with tickle me pink the company has delivered with a charismatic stunning perfectly cast model for our music videos gabriella was a pleasure as is every aspect of collaborating with digital playground
1566729 anyone that watches the music video will see how erotic and sensual gabriella is

1566731 japan and south korea have reportedly joined the united kingdom and america in issuing travel warnings to their respective citizens with warnings from the commonwealth also contributing to cancellations from italy and spain
1566732 the countrys largest hospitality group african sun limited said arrivals during the six months to march had declined six percent from last years growth of 17 percent the group said they had cancellations of close to 10 000 rooms by foreigners just before the harmonised elections
1566733 tourist arrivals recorded an 11 percent increase from 305 757 in the fist quarter of 2007 to 340 810 recorded during the first quarter of 2008 despite the negative publicity that the country is currently going through
1566734 whoever the zimbabwean negotiators agree on we will be happy to sit down with we can only boycott the forthcoming sadc summit if we feel the democratic process of setting up a new zimbabwean government was questionable
1566735 to us as the botswana government it does not matter who the two negotiating parties agree on as the head of a new zimbabwean government
1566736 if they agree on mugabe or tsvangarai before the august 16 sadc summit we will receive that leader with both hands
1566737 some people think we hate mugabe as a person no to us it is not the candidature that matters but the political process
1566738 well im really beautiful so id be good at this
1566739 this is really dumb its just so pointless even going up for it
1566740 how can i take the whole beautiful thing as an interpretation
1566741 it is indeed true that the exportation of specified basic commodities has been suspended
1566742 this is with effect from july 23 2008 and will last for a period of 12 months
1566743 we did not have a long briefing on the goat issue
1566744 my understanding is they got through the first barrier but thanks to the mtas great security let it be known they did not get through the second barrier so that fort wadsworth was protected from the infamous goat problem
1566745 i keep thinking about the poor people in the other car and i feel so bad for their families
1566746 his behavior has been bad since eighth grade and since then its been getting worse and worse
1566747 childrens services mourns the loss of hyekyung kim a valued member of our staff who devoted her career to protecting children
1566748 thats unbelievable for chubashvili to take two lives its terrible
1566749 homicidal african dictator who stays in power against all odds
1566750 he listens a lot he just blinks and listens he lets you talk he leans back with his head cocked to one side resting on his hands
1566751 you can never ever convince an englishman that you are equal to him never never
1566752 he was the star and then the sun came up
1566753 it was my job to apply to the police for clearance to hold party meetings
1566754 bright flames my brick and thatch house already on fire
1566755 i see you i know who you are and you are the ones who have burned down my house
1566756 i decided better for me to come out or they will kill my family
1566757 im going to go out and when they come after me you must all run away as fast as you can and hide
1566758 i heard the bones in my arms crack and i cried out oh jesus im dying here what have i done wrong
1566759 lets leave him come back and finish him off tonight
1566760 i was in such terrible pain and i thought i was dying and i decided better to kill myself than just wait for them to come
1566761 one hears these things generally but one is not sure if they are true of the details
1566762 i was politically conscious yes but never in my wildest dreams did i expect to be in this position
1566763 in africa they usually use the gun we have resisted that
1566764 a long time ago in a beautiful land far from here
1566765 and the only sound to be heard in that beautiful land was the drone of the kings voice
1566766 but in that time there were songs that the king could not reach these were the peoples most precious songs the songs they sang in their dreams in the dry valleys of dreamland the silent choirs sang their songs the battered men in forgotten jails the broken women on foreign soils families resting in unmarked graves the hungry the lost the landless and their songs rose like thunderclouds over the land
1566767 we must understand that technologies like these are the way of the future

1566774 the phone hasnt stopped ringing we are now taking more bookings than ever and our site is on the front page of search engines brilliant
1566775 california is in financial crisis state employees are suffering and how dare you spend taxpayer money on laws that have failed time and again in every other state
1566776 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds
1566777 rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1566778 caregivers are not well served by court battles and legal fees rather they would have been far better off if state officials worked together with our industry to raise awareness about video game ratings and the parental controls available on all new game consoles both of which help ensure that the games children play are parent approved
1566779 it is unfortunate that the state is stubbornly pursuing an appeal that is likely to lead to even more court awarded fees
1566780 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex a way for them to become closer to god
1566781 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
1566782 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness
1566783 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
1566784 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
1566785 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
1566786 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does
1566787 the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering
1566788 i look at it this way you dont have to have a heart condition to be a cardiologist and you dont have to be an alcoholic to work as a therapist
1566789 the holy fathers theology of the body and other philosophical and theological works delve deeply into the divinity of sexual relations in marriage im just making these complex ideas more accessible to average catholics
1566790 the workshops with father knotz really helped us to overcome our inhibitions and guilt regarding sex
1566791 he really listens to couples and this is why i think he understands us so well
1566792 its a novel approach which in my experience helps couples achieve greater intimacy so why not
1566793 a key feature of the portal site is that it offers an open source standards based archives platform using a web language called encoded archival description ead which enables the files to be shared with other archives in ireland and internationally
1566794 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
1566795 the russian orthodox church has to state with regret that the decision to install women bishops impedes the dialogue between orthodox christians and anglicans developed for some decades
1566796 alienates anglicans from the orthodox church and contributes in further division of the christian world
1566797 such practice contradicts centuries old church tradition dating back to the first christian community orthodox christians consider women bishops even more unacceptable
1566798 direct spiritual successors of apostles who grant them a special blessing to lead gods people and a special responsibility to keep the purity of faith and be symbols and guarantors of church unity
1566799 the course of savior holy apostles and ancient undivided church
1566800 it is not a theological or practical church need that dictated this decision to the anglican general synod but rather its strive to keep step with secular idea of sexual equality in all spheres of life
1566801 secularization of christianity makes many believers to abandon it as they strive to find spiritual support in secure gospels and apostolic traditions introduced by eternal and unchangeable god
1566802 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
1566803 an influence is not the same as a cause genes and hormones may predispose a person to one sexuality rather than another but thats all predisposition and determination are two different things there is a major problem with gay gene theory and with all theories that posit the biological programming of sexual orientation if heterosexuality and homosexuality are indeed genetically predetermined and therefore mutually exclusive and unchangeable how do we explain bisexuality or people who suddenly in mid life switch from heterosexuality to homosexuality or vice versa we cant the reality is that queer and straight desires are far more ambiguous blurred and overlapping than any theory of genetic causality can allow
1566804 the relative influence of biological versus social factors with regard to sexual orientation is still uncertain what is however certain is that if gayness was primarily explainable in genetic terms we would expect it to appear in the same proportions and in similar forms in all cultures and all epochs as the anthropologists clellan ford and frank beach demonstrated in patterns of sexual behaviour 1965 far from being cross culturally uniform and stable both the incidence and expressions of same sex desire vary vastly between different societies
1566805 the homophobes are thus paradoxically closer to the truth than many gay activists
1566806 for most of us it is impossible to subsequently change our sexual orientation
1566807 to be haitian or a hemophiliac is determined at birth but being gay is an identity that is socially determined and involves personal choice even if as many want to argue one has no choice in experiencing homosexual desire there is a wide choice of possible ways of acting out these feelings from celibacy and denial to self affirmation and the adoption of a gay identity
1566808 i think the idea that sexuality is genetic is crap there is absolutely no evidence for it at the moment and i think it is unhealthy that people want to embrace this idea it does reflect a desire to say its not our fault as a way of deflecting our critics we have achieved what we have achieved by defiance not by concessions i think we should be recruiting people to homosexuality its a great lifestyle and something everybody should have the right to experience if you believe its genetic how are you going to make the effort
1566809 on the question of recruiting to homosexuality well of course i am in favor of this i believe homosexuality to be a perfectly valid lifestyle choice i am naturally keen to encourage people to participate in the gay lifestyle
1566810 made the decision to become political lesbians as we called it
1566811 you can learn to be heterosexual and you can learn to be lesbian
1566812 i dont think theres anything natural about sexuality you do learn it and you can unlearn it go in a different direction change it
1566813 a radical gathering place for people who have chosen to be queer
1566814 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
1566815 in germany they came first for the communists and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a communist then they came for the jews and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a jew then they came for the trade unionists and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a trade unionist then they came for the catholics and i didnt speak up because i was a protestant then they came for me and by that time no one was left to speak up
1566816 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
1566817 if i profess with the loudest voice and the clearest exposition every portion of the truth of god except precisely that point which the world and the devil are at that moment attacking then i am not confessing christ however boldly i may be professing him where the battle rages there the loyalty of the soldier is proved and to be steady on all the battlefront besides is merely flight and disgrace if he flinches at that point
1566818 tony blair has given us 20 months to adapt 2 000 years of christian teaching its unacceptable
1566819 we felt six or twelve months would be a reasonable period for agencies to retrain their adoption staff but if it takes eighteen months to reverse a thousand years of prejudice we can probably live with that
1566820 you are my son whom i love with you i am well pleased
1566821 this is my son in whom i am well pleased
1566822 i am the door if anyone enters through me he shall be saved
1566823 enter by the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and many are those who enter by it for the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life and few are those who find it
1566824 unless you believe that i am he you shall die in your sins
1566825 there is one god and one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus
1566826 i even i am the lord and there is no saviour besides me
1566827 how can anyone debate the practice of two men using their respective waste passages as a playground in order that it may become legally acceptable is totally beyond my understanding
1566828 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time you know and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1566829 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
1566830 that this house believes that no public servant should be allowed to discriminate on this arbitrary basis and should this case not be reversed on appeal calls on the government to clarify and amend the law to guard the public against discrimination and prejudice by public servants in the future
1566831 the whole point of civil partnerships is that they are legal contracts handed out by the state
1566832 they have nothing to do with religion and therefore the religious beliefs of a public servant carrying them out are irrelevant
1566833 the fact that she can append her bigotry to a minority view within a church attended by a vanishingly small section of the british population apparently swung the day
1566834 regardless of her personal convictions the job of a registrar does now involve presiding over civil ceremonies for gay couples
1566835 the suggestion seems to be that rights in law are conferred on her by virtue of her christianity that a special protection should be extended to her prejudice because it is superstitious in character

1566855 i dont golf i dont know because my back is too big maybe
1566856 i make sure that i drive a nice car i dress well and im healthy
1566857 i dont see josh and chad as a threat to my business
1566858 well wait for someone else or well take it off the market
1566859 cut jesse cus hes eating us out of house and home
1566860 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1566861 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1566862 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
1566863 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1566864 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else

1566870 of course i would have liked to have been there advocating for a peaceful resolution
1566871 hes behind but well work to get him up to speed and we know hes the kind of player who will get himself caught up
1566872 right from the start through the draft and minicamps he has shown us things that are innate to successful nfl linebackers
1566873 hes behind but well work to get him up to speed and we know hes the kind of player who will get himself caught up
1566874 right from the start through the draft and minicamps he has shown us things that are innate to successful nfl linebackers
1566875 i want to catch up quick on what i missed and move forward as fast as i can
1566876 i call upon the national olympic committees and international federations to be sure that we meet the deadline of compliance
1566877 i make an appeal to governments to accelerate the ratification of the unesco treaty
1566878 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1566879 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1566880 i felt a little bit embarrassed talking about doping when my country had not signed
1566881 wada will give every assistance for all stakeholders to be compliant by november
1566882 the real onus is on the countries and sports federations to ensure that the athletes who have been sent to beijing are clean
1566883 wada the ioc and bocog beijings organizing committee cannot guarantee that all athletes at the games will not try to dope
1566884 i call upon the national olympic committees and international federations to be sure that we meet the deadline of compliance

1566891 wada the ioc and bocog beijings organizing committee cannot guarantee that all athletes at the games will not try to dope
1566892 we can be sure however that anybody who dopes risks getting caught as the testing will be more frequent and significant than at any other olympic games
1566893 i didnt even want to work there i was just helping a buddy
1566894 its a number of things but jacob was the straw that broke the camels back
1566895 and i dont think i can fight the fight anymore i think this has taken the life out of me
1566896 no record of any conditional use permit for cages or perimeter fence
1566897 ive got animals out there i love as much as some of my grandkids probably
1566898 its fraught with animal welfare concerns and it does not bring back a loved one
1566899 we dont need new sources to compete with animal shelters and reputable breeders
1566900 i believe that booger was an angel that god rented out to me for short period of time
1566901 and he knew i would be lost without him so he sent me some more he sent me five more mini boogers
1566902 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
1566903 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
1566904 ought to welcome people being able to express their minds and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely is a mistake
1566905 this is an athletics event but its also an opportunity to say to the chinese people we respect your traditions we respect your history
1566906 reorient and maximize the use of the very limited fiscal resources of government in the wake of the global economic difficulties
1566907 i will fully support the budget of the president but we would first want to ascertain where each appropriation of the 2008 gaa went especially on food sufficiency energy and infrastructure
1566908 we want to make sure that the work targets of every department were on track and these were properly implemented
1566909 we can understand the palaces decision to move back its plan of formulating a balanced budget the global economic slowdown triggered by the spiraling prices of oil and commodities is enough explanation
1566910 parallel countryside development bills to revitalize rural development and ensure food self sufficiency
1566911 this is a serious grave and tragic event there are a number of undisciplined military commanders and ethnic cleansing could happen
1566912 ang temperament dun mainit nasasaktan ang mga tao the temperament there right now is volatile the people are hurt they are enraged by the way they handled the problem in mindanao
1566913 but there was never an order giving offensive against the milf
1566914 para lang maihabol sa sona so that it could be included in the sona
1566915 the initials only served to check the accuracy of the document it is no way considered a final signature
1566916 we have clear instructions from president gloria macapagal arroyo to be vigilant amid recent developments
1566917 we are likewise directed to take appropriate actions while upholding the primacy of the peace process to protect the citizens from harm by lawless elements that disrupt peace
1566918 there is no policy restraining the military organization to defend the filipino people from any threat regardless of his creed political belief and ideological position
1566919 we assure our brothers in north cotabato and all our countrymen that your armed forces is capable and aptly equipped to address the threats besetting them
1566920 our official position is that the agreement on ancestral domain has been signed so its a done deal
1566921 not until then can anything be implemented sa katunayan kahit mapirmahan iyong comprehensive compact agreement ay kinakailangan ang mag usap in fact even if the comprehensive compact agreement is signed there is still a need to talk
1566922 hindi nangangahulugan na kung sakali nagkapirmahan ng moa on ancestral domain ay iyan na ang kasunduan it doesnt mean that if the moa on ancestral domain is signed that is the agreement
1566923 the moa on ancestral domain was just one of three major agenda items with each agenda hoping to strengthen the final agreement there is still a need to send it to congress for a new law that will effectively implement it
1566924 we wanted something more interesting and more fun than a regular online petition with a list of names but the message remains the same zero vat on oil
1566925 this is a chance for all to tell the government we will no longer foot the bill through this katas ng vat without a fight
1566926 the poor have been sacrificing the most as a result of the vat on oil we want to debunk the administrations propaganda that the governments programs are hinged on vat collections which are a mere decimal point to the entire national budget of p1 3 trillion
1566927 our government needs to change tack in dealing with changing circumstances while the vat on oil may have served its purpose three years ago it only serves to burden the people today what the people need now is the government to tighten its belt and collect more efficiently
1566928 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1566929 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1566930 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1566931 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1566932 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1566933 the players they want it resolved even talk to brett about it he feels bad about it its time for them to talk about somebody else
1566934 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1566935 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1566936 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1566937 investors are waiting to see whether the ecb will recognize the downside risks to growth and current soft economic conditions in the euro zone or continue to focus on inflation
1566938 we continue to think the fed is in no hurry to act and will be paying close attention to developments in the economy and financial markets
1566939 we suspect us rates will remain on hold well into 2009 and then increase only moderately
1566940 even if it becomes a consolidated subsidiary sony bmg would make a negligible contribution to this years operating profits as it has current year restructuring costs of 140 million
1566941 the scene was set for today with the fall in oil inspired rally in the us and the federal reserve retaining a neutral stance
1566942 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1566943 my view has been all along and it remains that the fed is going to be on hold for a good deal of time
1566944 we believe that the fed will be in a position to hold rates steady well into 2009
1566945 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1566946 my view is that unemployment is going to go to 6 5 percent and that will be new information for the fed that will force them to keep rates unchanged for the next 12 months
1566947 its important because they do get a negative attitude toward police sometimes and we want to change that opinion and show them that were here for them and we want to be a part of the community with them
1566948 were only as successful sometimes as the neighbors allow us to be
1566949 if you have information if you have suspects if you know of things that are happening in your community that shouldnt be you need to let us know the more you share with us the more successful we are able to be as a police force
1566950 they need to let the police know whats going on in their neighborhood whats going on in the corners whats going on in the house down on the corner when theres traffic in and out
1566951 to me vocatum is a place where the name of jesus is highly and consistently exalted and where we find our calling in the shadow of the cross
1566952 my changeup was real good thats what ive been waiting for
1566953 give all the credit to j j he kept us in the game
1566954 he thought the first foul ball he hit was the hardest ball the whole at bat
1566955 if were going to win its going to take them to keep doing what theyve been doing
1566956 we wanted to win that game and somehow we did these guys cleveland have pressed us hard
1566957 its been a little difficult to get in a good groove especially today
1566958 i was trying to get back into the strike zone but i was unable
1566959 today i think we did come through a little bit
1566960 i was sitting there keeping the pitching chart like we always do before we pitch it caught me off guard
1566961 i didnt have much time to think about all the stuff going on i just tried to separate it and keep things as cool as possible i didnt think much of it
1566962 youre in a pennant race and sometimes things kind of boil up a little bit i just kind of ended up there
1566963 baseball is the only sport where you dont want to have the time of possession
1566964 he pitched a great game and kept us in the dugout
1566965 they were taking pitches and taking good swings i was in the same sequence on every batter hard soft hard soft that wont happen again
1566966 they hit some two strike pitches over the heart of the plate that usually are on the corners
1566967 i tried to let it out and it didnt cooperate so i had to back off a little bit i had been feeling great all week
1566968 to me vocatum is a place where the name of jesus is highly and consistently exalted and where we find our calling in the shadow of the cross
1566969 i think the consensus of opinion was that he wasnt given an adequate opportunity to prepare himself to come here
1566970 the guys been snake bitten somewhat because of a variety of things that have happened to him and i think everybodys very much aware of his history
1566971 while i was running to second i watched the whole thing transpire it was kind of weird because everything is happening that fast all at once you cant really tell whats going on and youre just waiting for it to end to really take a look the ball rolled on the wall for 10 feet and he came in and pulled down the offensive board it was even more amazing to see it on the replay
1566972 i should have caught the ball it hit in the pocket of my glove ross did a great job he jumped up and grabbed it
1566973 the biggest thing is you look around and nobody is counting on you to be that guy
1566974 youre just a complementary piece of that puzzle since ive been here ive had two guys on base every second or third time i get up there thats a testament to the lineup
1566975 just coming over here im trying to be comfortable and trying not to do too much i think thats probably helped simplify it obviously some success early helps you relax a little bit
1566976 anytime you have two pitches you can throw for strikes it makes it tough
1566977 i had a good fastball and a good curveball i cant pinpoint one pitch i got more outs with
1566978 i was just trying to keep it close and get to our good bullpen guys
1566979 what about the guy getting suspended on a night when ive got to face beckett
1566980 i feel like i need to be turning that water into wine
1566981 in certain in ways im lucky to be out there
1566982 i threw all right my movement was a little bit off
1566983 its been a nice resurrection for them and for him
1566984 this is beauty for ashes this is the sound of a song in the night
1566985 expresses the concern of the irish church for the suffering of the worldspoorest and most oppressed people
1566986 combine medical care and christian ministry into a powerful combination that can deliver the healing touch of god
1566987 and the people when they saw jesus followed him and he received them and he spoke unto them of the kingdom of god and he healed all who had need of healing
1566988 every human being has an intrinsic and inalienable dignity that begins at conception and extends through our natural lives until natural death this dignity the most precious endowment of the human person is involiable the dignity of the human person must be cherished in custom and protected by law we recognize that the intrinsic dignity of the person is the foundation of every human right and is independent of any individual condition no human community can grant or rescind that dignity we invite all those who share these convictions to join us in affirming them and to give them effect in public life at all levels
1566989 what are your goals for increasing womens participation in society
1566990 to me vocatum is a place where the name of jesus is highly and consistently exalted and where we find our calling in the shadow of the cross
1566991 is here to rain on the parade and remind us of the brain dead action pics that can be counted on to populate theaters for the second half of the summer
1566992 for crying out loud warren cant you just beat your chest like everybody else
1566993 sad to lose a lawyer of such skill determination and professionalism
1566994 the system costs more but you recapture your money within three to five years
1566995 we have to plan for the worst and hope for the best because its a strange world
1566996 all i can say is one word his condition is serious
1566997 hoy en hiroshima de nuevo me comprometo a que nuestro pa s mantenga firmemente los tres principios antinucleares y que lidere la sociedad internacional a favor de la abolici n de las armas nucleares para sostener la paz
1566998 el nico papel de las armas nucleares es ser abolidas
1566999 conscientemente a la mayor a para la que la m xima prioridad es la supervivencia humana
1567000 determinaci n de lograr un mundo seguro y en paz sin armas nucleares
1567001 no es una competencia leal me parece marco antonio no tiene porque ofrecer nada pues l no es parte del programa no le corresponde es una guerra sucia
1567002 el argumento del tribunal constitucional para postergar caso el front n es rid culo y pat tico
1567003 i am taking off the old crown and you may hear some crunching
1567004 he hung on to it forever he ran it into the ground
1567005 what are you going to do sit there and cry in your milk it doesnt work that way
1567006 are you on borrowed time yeah but its good borrowed time if i can get another six months out of this thatd be great if i get two months out of it thatd be great too its been a great ride
1567007 he was always looking for the fun things to do in life
1567008 losing ken is just a tragedy we all feel quite robbed
1567009 we thought the tree was going to fall on the house
1567010 it was crazy were laughing about it now but it was crazy
1567011 its just amazing how much mother nature can do in five to 10 minutes
1567012 everything from traditional trees and power lines down to lightning and roofs being ripped off schools
1567013 nows the time to start thinking about the next time around and to make sure they have a plan on what theyre going to do next time this happens
1567014 i was in a big truck but ive seen wind that can pick a truck up theres no safe place really
1567015 they were trapped against the metal breakwall and were getting battered by pretty big waves
1567016 i deployed a disc from about 40 yards out to get to the male and reeled him in
1567017 it was a lucky toss and she got a hold of it
1567018 it sounds like she got sucked out first and they stood on a rock for a little while
1567019 when the water died down they thought they could make a break for it but then they got caught in a revolving door of waves
1567020 i dont know anyone who is an exceptional enough swimmer who could have gone out there
1567021 i was just doing what any of us would have done it really was a team effort
1567022 you can google it youll see t shirts youll see signs
1567023 in this economy the way things are today you have to think outside the box its a play on words it was never meant to insult anybody
1567024 we fully support her first amendment rights but theres a greater issue here is this the language that can be used to best promote her car wash shes using a double entendre that could leave a negative impression of her business and the city
1567025 that is protected speech commercial speech particularly since the mid 1990s is entitled to a fair amount of protection under the first amendment
1567026 theres nothing obscene about that at all they ought to lighten up and have a sense of humor in my mind its a gross overreaction
1567027 its part of my car wash lingo im considering putting it on shirts for my employees
1567028 my sign is my sign and we still live in america
1567029 the judge did not address the merit of the case
1567030 our position is we educate the public about what goes on at rodeos the injuries the abuse the deaths
1567031 if they sue in illinois well fight and i fully expect we will win
1567032 they had a list of legal questions about our proposal so theyve asked us to delay this discussion
1567033 weve submitted the questions to our corporate council and in fairness to the association well have this discussion at a later date
1567034 we realize our good landlords are already doing credit checks
1567035 but we also had some folks tell us they thought checking a prospective tenants credit history could be an invasion of privacy so we removed the requirement
1567036 this has been a long time coming and i am thankful that we got here
1567037 now we are passed that point and can get to the fun stuff of selling and designing
1567038 these guys were in first place before i got here
1567039 i feel like usually im probably the loud one before the game but in no way shape or form am i on this team
1567040 i came up as a second hitter so i really wasnt thinking about home runs it just happened
1567041 even now the main thing is getting guys over and getting them in its not hitting the ball out of the ballpark but that is what people are fascinated with is the home runs
1567042 when i had the initial conversation with him i explained we were not asking you to be our everyday center fielder were only asking you to go out there when you feel great
1567043 ill be trying to get dh at bats for everybody
1567044 balentien is probably best as a right fielder followed by center he has the least experience in left
1567045 raul and ichiro are on pace for a lot of at bats this year so well try and get them off days by letting them dh a little
1567046 i hate to see him keep going back and forth between the rotation and the bullpen
1567047 but the thing that is mystifying to me is the number of walks
1567048 the thing that mystifies me are the walks to punto both times on four pitches
1567049 when miguel batista is right he doesnt do that hes not going to throw two four pitch walks right in front of their two big studs its not just a pitch or two hes missing on he hasnt been able to regroup and get back in the zone
1567050 i think it is apparent that the people who prepared this get an f
1567051 it validates the concerns we raised but it doesnt provide any viable solutions
1567052 to date the parties conducting todays hearing have not yet acknowledged the significant public benefits this transaction would provide to the regional economy and to dozens of chicago area communities that would see a reduction in freight traffic as a result of the transaction
1567053 the reality is that if this transaction were approved more than 60 communities would experience rail congestion relief roughly two times the number that would see increased rail traffic
1567054 the negative impacts that are measurable far outweigh the measurable benefits
1567055 approval of this rail sale will be totally life changing
1567056 if they want to operate on that line then they have the obligation to pay for the mitigation
1567057 thousands of people in towns that abut the existing cn lines stand to benefit from reductions in rail and highway congestion a decrease in train noise and relative improvements to safety
1567058 it would also set the stage for possible enhancements to metra service
1567059 the way to resolve the problem is not to shift the problem its is to not make it a problem for anyone
1567060 we need to take a step back and see how we want to move freight traffic through the region
1567061 she just didnt think it was important or she didnt want anybody to know
1567062 the problem is when youre having a trial and not disclosing that stuff it could be an ethical violation not to disclose it we have to be aware of these things so we can make sure these cases are aboveboard
1567063 makes it all the more important that he be removed from the leadoff spot
1567064 the mystery of alfonso soriano do some players just like batting leadoff
1567065 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1567066 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1567067 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1567068 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1567069 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1567070 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1567071 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1567072 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1567073 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1567074 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows

1567081 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation is increasingly driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
1567082 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of global corporations than many millions of poor farmers
1567083 green groups are learning to use public boycotts and embarrassment to target the corporate bad guys
1567084 and it already seeing the global soy palm oil and timber industries beginning to change their approach theyre realizing they cant run roughshod over the just too risky for them
1567085 in addition some massive financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup and bank of america have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists
1567086 many multinational corporations are developing greener products because theyre more profitable for example the market for eco friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the u s by 2010
1567087 we argue that the public and green groups need to send a loud clear message to the corporate sector
1567088 c amp ls late nite music club with the rolling stones
1567089 im a rather formal type of person but im committed to leading by example
1567090 you can feel very comfortable even in conducting diplomacy i think this is good
1567091 i sincerely hope that all of our united nations staff agencies and funds and programs and hopefully member states will also participate in this important initiative
1567092 the cool un initiative was inspired by many factors including government program such as
1567093 i dont think we want to get involved in the fashion police business of determining exactly what people can wear but i think the encouragement of being business casual would be probably where we are going
1567094 we can at least save 300 tons of greenhouse gas emissions we can also conserve energy by 10 percent
1567095 this is for the convenience and comfort of delegations who will have to engage in very important negotiations and debates on world affairs
1567096 this is another example of unrealistic cost estimates for government projects senator mccain will demand that government estimates reflect the real costs of projects
1567097 its a lot of money but i would argue pretty strenuously the cost of doing nothing is a lot higher
1567098 we did do a search warrant at a mapleton residence and found more dogs and had to red tag the home because of the condition it was in a lot of dog feces a lot of dogs in the residence
1567099 it did appear like they were getting food and water they probably dont weigh what they should weigh but theyre not malnourished medical wise they were loaded with fleas they also had lice they had hair loss due to the fact that they were living in wet conditions probably having to lay and sleep in their own feces and urine
1567100 weve never had a case like this that i can remember since ive been here where so many dogs had kind of been thrown out
1567101 we were walking along the beach at a point and i looked down and i saw it and i asked my dad what it was and he thought it was petrified wood
1567102 we kinda looked at it we kinda pushed some of the rocks away
1567103 we saw the head the spine and then we saw some of the rib cage
1567104 its probably been there for a long time underwater because it was underwater all spring here when the water was high

1567107 i have come to change the government not to praise it
1567108 those who disagree with me are racist and want to destroy the
1567109 a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government it can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury from that moment on the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy always followed by a dictatorship the average age of the worlds greatest civilizations has been 200 years great nations rise and fall the people go from bondage to spiritual faith from spiritual faith to great courage from courage to liberty from liberty to abundance from abundance to selfishness from selfishness to complacency from complacency to apathy from apathy to dependence from dependence back again to bondage

1567115 our biggest concern is that agriculture will be put back on the backburner where its been for some years and not be given full consideration which will cost it in the longer term
1567116 obama rallies look like a day at the zoo you have the ape like n s smelling up the place and the prancing peacock queers along with the bull dikes
1567117 we believe that the decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1567118 the states lawsuit isnt about the science of global warming and polar bears
1567119 it is merely doing the bidding of oil companies that want to drill for oil in sensitive polar bear habitat without any concern for how that oil will impact the climate when its burned
1567120 additional regulation of the species and its habitat under the endangered species act will deter activities such as commercial fisheries oil and gas exploration and development transportation and tourism within and off shore of alaska
1567121 i know how much the auto industry and the autoworkers of this state have struggled over the last decade or so
1567122 but i also know where i want the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow to be built not in japan not in china but right here in the united states of america right here in the state of michigan
1567123 it seems like the oil companies are price fixing to avoid national competition and they shouldnt
1567124 that shows how out of touch he is with michigan voters
1567125 hes pandering to san francisco liberals and environmentalists who would just as soon we not have cars
1567126 the market will spur the drive to more fuel efficient cars
1567127 most people will actually feel climate change delivered to them by the postman

1567133 the oil deregulates the mechanism that controls their body temperature

1567246 i have not posted on here in a while so not sure if this subject has been raised of late but i wanted to find out if there were any other residents in the neighborhood concerned about the proposed wine bar for the southwest corner of 11th and lamont streets nw i am adamantly opposed to it primarily because i live in close proximity and am certain this will lead to late night crowding noise and other pollution while that corridor of 11th street is zoned commercial i doubt most of us want to see it turn into a corridor of bars as a resident in close proximity of the business i suffered enough from the trash and nuisance horrible overflowing dumpsters and lots of rats at my doorstep when the location was a deli i can only imagine it will be worse as a bar i plan to oppose the liquor license at the hearing in september and would appreciate hearing from other like minded neighbors i am also willing to organize a petition drive
1567247 i can understand your concerns but respectfully disagree with you

1567294 that is exactly what i am doing im talking to you about something altogether different something that women your age or any age were not allowed to talk about at all until recently something i never thought i would ever tell you but i also never thought i would lose your father at such a young age or so suddenly or that my life would turn out the way it has

1567299 i have been in love with your aunti em for as long as i can remember since we were in high school we loved each other from the day we met but neither of us had the courage to be honest about our feelings so for years and years neither of us ever told the other how we felt
1567300 and of course neither of us could ever have told our parents or other family members the truth so we were just the best of friends we double dated and were each others maids of honor in our weddings we made sure that we married men who would also be friends so that we could always be together shes been like a second mother to you all of your life
1567301 mom you know that i adore her but im not sure that im ready for her to be my new stepfather
1567302 are you telling me that my whole life has been based on a lie that you never loved dad and your marriage was a sham
1567303 no you must never think that i loved your father i love him still if he were alive we would not be having this conversation there would be nothing to discuss your father and i were completely faithful to each other and still would be if he were with us but
1567304 so you just need to get out there and date some nice men mom
1567305 you are just going through the grief of losing dad and auntie em has always been your best friend so this is just some kind of transference of your feelings

1567308 i love you more than life itself but with or without your blessing em and i will be married and start our new life together
1567309 em lives here now she has sort of gradually been moving in over the past few weeks while getting her house ready to put on the market we are going to live here together after the wedding

1567526 tapi saya tetap gembira dan bersemangat kerana rata rata bekas pelajar af6 pada malam ini nampak lebih berkeyakinan dan menampilkan persembahan jauh lebih baik berbanding ketika konsert akhir dulu
1567527 kami memang jarang berjumpa kerana masing masing ada agenda seni tersendiri justeru konsert ini peluang untuk kami mengeratkan hubungan persahabatan yang sedia terjalin

1567532 jika tahun lalu konsert reunion af5 diadakan di kedah kerana konsert gempak selebriti astro juga diadakan di sana kini konsert gempak diadakan di melaka dan mendapat kerjasama pelancongan melaka justeru kami putuskan untuk mengadakan konsert reunion af6 juga di sini
1567533 kami juga membuat perancangan awal untuk menjayakan konsert ini sebaik konsert af6 berakhir
1567534 kami juga berbincang dengan pelajar dan memilih lagu yang sesuai untuk disampaikan mereka pada konsert itu contohnya lagu rancak dipilih sesuai untuk persembahan dalam konsert

1567592 one night two men arrived at the abandoned house on the border between libya and tunisia in which we were waiting to leave for the sea there was some 40 of us and these people who wore uniforms took me away i was taken to a deserted house where they raped me
1567593 when they freed me and i returned to the group i was received by two other women who embraced me and the expression on their faces showed that they had suffered the same abuse

1567600 im a firm believer that everything happens for a reason the downside is some of this is good some of it is bad one thing i know forever is that ive got the greatest bunch of guys and girls in the world down in that mill you can say you are buying this asset or that asset or this mill or that mill but what you really are buying are those people who have shown time and time again that theyll never give up

1567603 concerns with the electric arc furnace the bof and the 80 inch
1567604 were satisfied with the judgment we dont have any complaints
1567605 the day is going to have to come when everybody puts this behind them
1567606 present the appropriate ordinances to undertake the acquisition and financing of certain buildings properties in the 1100 block of main and market streets
1567607 we will identify any restrictions on the property in the event council wants to sell the property
1567608 we all know this is one our greatest challenges of all time
1567609 we have already recalled the product and we dont produce it anymore
1567610 we werent interested in this as only a marketing project
1567611 we wanted to experiment and see if we could genuinely break new ground online

1567622 they made the choice to do it anyway i felt like they need to be held accountable
1567623 denied any intentional actions that would result in the birds death
1567624 he had intentionally steered his vehicle into the gutter with the intent of striking the bird he told officers he was unsure why he had done it

1567628 its kind of scary that someone driving along in their car who hits an animal that doesnt get out of the road or fly out of the road can be charged with cruelty to animals
1567629 its just a waste of time in my mind its not like a crow is a protected animal or anything

1567840 whole heck o alot of rocket fuel just lying on top of frozen water on a planet with 38 of the gravity of earth
1567841 photos taken on mars surface of a viking magnetic experiment on both landers show material clinging to the magnets

1567843 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i had also to survive
1567844 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they didnt trust it any more
1567845 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem
1567846 so actually everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody were leaving each other
1567847 i didnt have time to start discussion the only thing i had to do was to go down because if you go down you have more oxygen you have more chance to survive
1567848 up there it was hell during the descent beyond 8000 metres due to the altitude and the exhaustion i even fell asleep in the snow and when i woke up i could not figure out where i was
1567849 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements
1567850 everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised with such stupid things lives are endangered
1567851 you can survive a maximum of 24 to 48 hours with supplementary oxygen itd be less than 24 hours without
1567852 wilco was up there three days above 8000 metres without supplementary oxygen after a few days everyone thought hed died

1567855 mr costello has made not one valuable structure change in the australian economy in the 12 years he was treasurer
1567856 hes a guy without imagination and he is a guy without courage
1567857 that point was proven by the fact he let former prime minister john howard stay there for so long
1567858 its a liberal party so bereft of talent that they have go to such a low grade performer as costello to come back as their leader he is a slow acting dope
1567859 in national terms to have such a nong and he is in policy terms he is a mouse to have him back again speaks volumes about the liberal party
1567860 in labor party terms i sort of hope he does as he makes it a better pitch for us
1567861 its always nice to fight at home and have your fans behind you supporting you every step of the way it motivates me and really gets me up for the fight i am looking forward to this fight and plan on putting on a great show and giving the fans in attendance something to be excited about

1567864 i thought kenny would live to be in his 90s because he was so easygoing he was a living legend in muskegon to us its a great loss just like max harnish or wes ramey
1567865 carlos ortiz told me three years ago that during his entire career no one was more difficult to figure out than kenny lane
1567866 ortiz told me that himself he said the guy was unbelievably clever

1567869 la relaci n que mantuvo el gobernador con el gobierno nacional el tema impositivo provincial en especial los impuestos inmobiliario y de ingresos brutos y las necesidades en cuanto a obra p blica
1567870 la reuni n con el gobernador est confirmada para el jueves a las 9 y los temas centrales ser n tres
1567871 se plantear la forma en que mantuvo relaci n con el gobierno nacional porque el 4 de abril cuando los productores discutimos la estrategia a llevar adelante l manifest que est bamos equivocados y que su alineamiento incondicional iba a dar mejores resultados que lo nuestro por eso queremos repasar con l cu les fueron los resultados de su estrategia
1567872 la idea es analizar el tema impositivo provincial en especial los impuestos inmobiliario y de ingresos brutos y por otra parte tratar concretamente las necesidades en cuanto a obra p blica
1567873 tambi n queremos dialogar sobre cuestiones que hacen a las mesas departamentales y se pedir que la provincia promueva el trabajo con las entidades a trav s del consejo federal agropecuario sobre la pol tica agropecuaria nacional
1567874 despu s de esa reuni n se mantendr un encuentro con los bloques legislativos y seguramente estaremos con h ctor strassera pj concordia y el bloque justicialista de senadores
1567875 yo creo que todos los temas se pueden acordar con voluntad de di logo hay temas que tienen que abordarse desde un aspecto m s general en la agenda del bicentenario que convoc la presidente
1567876 muchos productores preocupados y en estado de alerta porque hay cuestiones pendientes de resoluci n
1567877 econom as regionales ser n una prioridad lo mismo que el tema lechero y que en las provincias la secretar a actuar con los gobernadores y las comisiones de enlace de cada regi n
1567878 es necesario darle un tratamiento preferencial la derogaci n de la resoluci n 125 no da por definido el tema
1567879 eso tenemos que charlarlo y discutirlo el tema qued en la mesa de discusi n y tiene que surgir de la madurez del di logo

1567882 we do not have any other information at this time
1567883 we need the eas consent to carry out the work
1567884 it is ludicrous that we cannot do this work everything is ready except the consent we have been told that we are likely to hear whether we have been granted consent in september but this is getting almost too late for us to act as the first major floods start in october
1567885 a lot of the problem is i think that the flood defence consent seems to be designed to ensure building developers do suitable ground works on new projects
1567886 there seems to have been no provision made by the ea for what happens when people say no we are not prepared to do nothing and accept this managed retreat this bureaucracy is delaying us from doing what we can to stop these breaches happening
1567887 when prince charles visited blythburgh last week he asked me about the problems i am having and said he found it extraordinary that this red tape should causes such delays
1567888 he said he wished to have further discussions with me regarding these issues

1567900 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1567901 the white house had concocted a fake letter from iraqi intelligence chief tahir jalil habbush to saddam hussein backdated to july 1 2001
1567902 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohamed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
1567903 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1567904 some circumstantial evidence is very strong as when you find a trout in the milk
1567905 embargoes are contrivances designed not to protect the contents of the book but to create a media feeding frenzy when a book comes out often the entire purpose is to protect some kind of exclusive arrangement with a particular news outlet thats not about news its about publicity and it implicates the news media as part of the publicity juggernaut reducing us watchdogs to lap dogs
1567906 the doctors say i should try to cut down to only 5 lines of cocaine a day before getting pregnant
1567907 everyone whos anyone is outsourcing nowadays we paid 100 to a couple in india to have a baby and then raise it themselves its so much more convenient
1567908 having seen all of the horrible parent child relationships in this family weve decided not to reproduce
1567909 actually we already had a baby but i had to give it to this guy named rumpelstiltskin
1567910 thank goodness im pregnant theres no way i could handle that party if i werent
1567911 gee this would be awesome for cleaning up cat litter
1567912 if the predicted thunderstorms scheduled to move through the north state this evening and tomorrow spark new wildland fires firefighters say they are ready to respond quickly
1567913 when observing the condition of our intimate interaction african americans are no longer interested in courting dating or harvesting the patience essential in the process of selecting the appropriate partner for our lives
1567914 he said that getting a white girl is easy pussy
1567915 i told him it was something i wanted to do and he supported it it was a great relief
1567916 im tired and stressed all the time and i just dont want to work anymore please say youll take care of me if i just quit my job and sit at home all day please please please
1567917 in the past few years many women who are well educated and trained for career tracks have decided instead to stay at home
1567918 the secrets of happily married women how to get more out of your relationship by doing less
1567919 no kids no jobs for a growing number of wives
1567920 it says we make enough money that we both dont need to work outside the home
1567921 and especially with the recent economic pressures a stay at home spouse is often an extreme and visible luxury
1567922 i go grocery shopping on wednesdays and clean house on thursdays
1567923 if you told me years ago that i was going to be a stay at home wife i would have laughed at you
1567924 i was able to clip coupons do all the chores and make nice dinners
1567925 i thought about the feminist movement all those women who worked so hard so that i could go out and have a good career and i was kind of saying no thanks
1567926 but i dont see what good it would do to work in a job that i couldnt stand and if i have the choice not to why wouldnt i take that opportunity
1567927 everyone seems to be ok with women staying home when they have kids
1567928 ive actually heard people say that women who dont work are a drain on society
1567929 many women i talk to take care of the household seriously and they want to focus on caring for the home whether or not it involves children
1567930 i hear frustration from men whose wives choose not to work
1567931 but only if there are financial stresses one of the realities is that few men appreciate the scope and difficulties of managing a household
1567932 when catherine stays at home i feel the house is more together because she has the time to do things like in depth cleaning and can be more attentive to the garden
1567933 she also has more time to find good deals at secondhand stores garage sales and at grocery stores
1567934 i dont believe that the woman has to be the exclusive cook cleaner or shopper and i dont believe the man must be the breadwinner i wouldnt mind staying at home while catherine works
1567935 99 9 of the stuff on the internet is rubbish
1567936 weve really got to reach out and be innovative and try new things we cant be afraid to fail
1567937 whether its automaking parts making financial industry it seems like the miami valley has definitely gotten the short end of the stick here lately
1567938 i think that article is reflective of the high concentration of auto manufacturing jobs that weve had in the past
1567939 i would expect in 2009 and 2010 to see dramatically different numbers
1567940 there is evil in your bones equality 7 2521 for your body has grown beyond the bodies of your brothers
1567941 the bbc sound index analyses what people are writing about listening to watching downloading and logging on to it then counts and analyses this data to make an instant list of the most popular 1000 artists and tracks on the web itunes myspace bebo google groups last fm and youtube the more blog mentions comments plays downloads and profile views an artist or track has the higher up the sound index they are so the sound index is a music buzz index controlled entirely by the public
1567942 we just touched the surface of the potential on the web
1567943 we are trying to make peoples interaction with the technology more natural and more physical
1567944 some of these things are right around the corner and some will take another 10 years to unfold
1567945 traditionally you would have to submit code but now you can just bring an idea even a sketch on a piece of paper
1567946 first there were hippies then there were yuppies and now swarming around us in their ethical yet impossibly stylish shoes we have scuppies a hybrid of the two standing for socially conscious upwardly mobile persons scuppies are the most influential consumer group of our time just like hippies they care about society and the environment but just like yuppies they care about their quality of life and bank balance too
1567947 the federal government intended to formally apologize for the komagata maru incident
1567948 we have started to hear rumblings from the community members as well as the opposition parties we strongly advise that the pm should announce a date at the mela for an official apology for komagata maru in the house of commons we do not want to cause any embarrassment to our good lead the right honourable stephen harper i hope you take our recommendation very seriously

1567953 if the big bang was the beginning of time itself then any discussion about what happened before the big bang or what caused it in the usual sense of physical causation is simply meaningless
1567954 why wont heather ever let me look in her purse
1567955 yeah weve announced to folks that its coming in early 2009 which baffle folks typically we show our games many many times at e3 over and over again and were not this time we showed it once a while back and went dark on it purposely to get the technology and the game going its not that far off its very exciting
1567956 to all those players who have enjoyed fury and played countless battles i am sorry that we could not find a viable business model that would allow you to continue playing to all those naysayers and doomsdayers we know that deep down you wanted fury to succeed have fun with your parting wishes

1567995 all the fuel stations in the city were surrounded by long lines of motorbikes and cars waiting to buy gasoline
1567996 many people even brought containers to the fuel stations to fill them up
1567997 the situation did not return to normal until the ministry of industry and trade issued an urgent message late tuesday afternoon denying the rumours
1567998 the government doesnt have any plan to raise the gasoline price
1567999 those starting the rumours will face an initial administrative punishment and if necessary criminal charges
1568000 started false rumours about food imbalances in our country to speculate on rice for profit and to smuggle to other countries
1568001 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1568002 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1568003 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work and i truly understand that if i was in mikes shoes id see it basically the same way he sees it im sure and i think if he was in my shoes hed see it my way i think we both agree on that
1568004 hes an nfl punter and he almost gets more praise and credit for being such a good guitar hero player when were going out to eat some of the fans are coming up to him and instead of them saying to him great game you did such a great job punting its more hey youre so unbelievable playing guitar hero
1568005 well it took him alot longer to dry because he did not like any of the crates we had him in until we moved them to a specific one where he stopped yelping

1568010 they the developers are going to be moving in on site within a week or two
1568011 were in the process now of drawing up a plan for bennett avenue
1568012 that area were looking at water sewer storm sewer curb gutter and sidewalk
1568013 it the development is a very positive development for the community and the business prospects of the area
1568014 im sort of waiting for the other shoe to drop
1568015 were certainly due now to have a big season i thought we might be getting it this year but we didnt
1568016 the cycle is what it is and somewhere along the way were going to get this blip well get either low snowfall or early runoff with high winds and warm weather once you get a few fires under those conditions then you can have some big ones fortunately that didnt happen this year
1568017 well be the primary beneficiaries of the new field so i took that angle with the girls
1568018 the least we can do is get out and support the kids who are coming up through the same sport that weve loved for a lifetime
1568019 most of us are going to be doing things involving soccer
1568020 a few people chose other things like helping out in the medical area or helping with communications
1568021 i put an e mail out and it was almost like some people were happy because they kept meaning to do it i brought the applications up to the field and the girls filled them out and signed them so then i just dropped them back down to the office as a group
1568022 there could be lots of volunteers on the other ladies teams they just never responded via e mail
1568023 a couple of people did and said theyd already volunteered and sent in their application but i never did get a list to see how many of the ladies were volunteering i didnt feel like being too pushy or anything
1568024 volunteerism is at the heart of any community development or sports program
1568025 were known for it in corner brook i think thats how we got the canada games in 1999
1568026 its so important to get out there not only to give back to the community but you can get a lot out of volunteering
1568027 you get to go out and be a part of it and experience the best part of our community you get to see what good is happening firsthand
1568028 this council theyve either got to move with respect to those dangers those hazardous areas or theyve got to go we can do with what we have as far as recreation we must remember especially the hazardous areas that already exist theyve got to be corrected its got to be a top priority
1568029 once that life is taken or gone you cant get it back lets put the priority where it belongs if were going to put in a new city hall lets put in a whole new council as well to deal with the problems
1568030 we already had one fatality in an area like that with respect to a snow slide
1568031 a small child went out on the edge of a snow slide the embankment gave way and the child was killed
1568032 if four five or a dozen children wander underneath that bridge and it collapses whats going to happen
1568033 if we let that go god forbid what have we got to really show with regard to those who were the true founders of our community for people coming here visiting our community
1568034 go anywhere in the world and for a lot of people thats the first place they look for the cemetery to look for important people who lived in the past
1568035 if you lose that its like the war memorial that represents our young people who gave their lives for freedom if you go on that war memorial and youll see every name etched in stone likewise with cemeteries
1568036 just because you complain and you say you want something done doesnt really mean we have an obligation to do it or that theres a need for us to do it

1568041 if you look at yesterday there was a big move in some of these banks if you look at an icici bank though it has been rallying for sometime yesterdays move was a significant move the way it has broken out above rs 684 shows that there is still quite a bit of steam is left in it it could go all the way to rs 763 what is more encouraging is it is not just the private sector banks like an icici bank or an axis bank but the psu banks which are now really starting to show strength
1568042 indian bank has very significant move above rs 102 109 and it has been an effortless this move in indian bank could easily take you to round about rs 134 145 the banking sector though it has been hammered down so much and though people are dismissing this as a pullback rally i think there is still quite a bit of steam left in quite a few of these banks

1568044 july was interesting for banks they went up more than 10 july was two months in one a very negative first half and a very positive second half banks have really gone up a lot from the bottom they hit but among the three rate sensitive banks realty and auto auto seems the finest because they are working on very thin margins banks because they will have the benefit of probably a slightly benign interest rate scenario in q2 q3 and q4 quarters would get the upside of any softening interest rates in their investment portfolios so among the rate sensitive i would say the safest picks would be the bank stocks

1568052 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1568053 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1568054 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate

1568058 cannot comprehend how many jewish people can speak of the holocaust as well as stating that israel is the holy land and commit the atrocities they are committing against the palestinian people
1568059 shed ourselves from the racist zionists in america they control everything but they wont keep us down any longer throw the jews in the oven this november its the only way we can free america and make sure barack obama is elected
1568060 israel has destroyed its own image in the world and is taking america down with its zionist aggression

1568069 someone made a scene that they were handing out the gospel of luke and they realized that these were evangelicals and an adult accused them of doing proselytism and thats illegal so that is why dr petrou was singled out
1568070 some of the legal things like this are being relaxed a little bit
1568071 and yet it still is on the books that it is illegal to proselytize
1568072 even though they were sharing the gospel it wasnt forced and it wasnt coerced in any way it wasnt taking advantage of people who might not understand what it is they were receiving
1568073 in fact what was being given out was a gospel of luke with a letter that explained who they were with the church one of the largest churches evangelical churches in greece and so because of their transparency the judge ruled in dr petrous favor
1568074 when youre part of that church it really is part of who you are part of your identity
1568075 just because of the nature of the church and the power it holds over the people and even the blindness of not truly understanding saving faith it is a difficult soil it is a hard ground to work
1568076 theyre effective because they know best how to reach their people
1568077 dr petrou has been part of the evangelical community for years

1568111 we have clear instructions from president gloria macapagal arroyo to be vigilant amid the recent developments

1568114 i today here in hiroshima again pledge that our country will firmly maintain the three anti nuclear principles and take the lead in international society to realize the abolition of nuclear weapons and lasting peace
1568115 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs

1568129 the earth its natural environments and their interactions with society
1568130 people need to be able to find sources of information on the internet they know they can trust
1568131 the eoe is a great reliable source of information on environmental topics that is available to anyone our goal is to make environmental information about the earth and its ecosystems accessible both in terms of the ability to get to it for free through the internet and to present the information in a way people can understand and use
1568132 we have many articles and have developed a special collection on the topic although there are still some areas where we could use more entries such as the impacts of climate change on oceans and the specifics of how climate change modeling works
1568133 the inspection found that four of the pumps here were overcharging customers for gasoline did you know that was happening
1568134 i have no idea on that because thats the machinery sometimes that happens we dont do it though

1568183 the starfish house was a brave design and i have no doubt that if it had actually been built it would have sold
1568184 but it is very difficult for people to grasp how a house like that will work and a risk for a developer to build speculatively
1568185 the truth is that the majority of people in this country love georgian architecture and this new design is for an utterly fabulous house in a wonderful setting
1568186 as you would expect the entrance hall is beautifully proportioned and impressive
1568187 while in georgian times the kitchens were for the staff here it is the focus of the house a huge space for cooking and family life that opens on to terraces and the gardens

1568227 prison and jail officials need the latest thinking on assessment tool options to inform prison and jail programming as well as decisions about release and community supervision
1568228 one reason this tool is so valuable is because it allows staff to search for key information at particular decision points such as admission to a facility or to search by topic areas such as risk and security classifications mental health substance abuse education employment housing family relationships and financial status

1568288 we love her and thats why we reached out to her and she happily agreed to participate
1568289 to be on the show and to hear other people its comforting to be around other people whove been through it

1568297 we really need to find some shelter food and water i cant walk much more
1568298 youre right weve been walking for two days non stop and we need to regain our strength
1568299 yeah thats definitely smoke and if were lucky theres a camp and some folk from gahara maybe lady luck is starting to smile upon up
1568300 what happened to our old friends better yet what happened to our oath
1568301 i still obey it since ive promised that i would until my body was no more but we need to find the other three to see if they still think the same
1568302 well i know that geoffrey lives there so when we reach the city well pay him a visit after your parents
1568303 i agree do you know where jaana and legorn are
1568304 i do not know but our best chance is to ask geoffrey maybe he knows
1568305 huh who are you and what are you doing here
1568306 it cant be b but i thought that all of my family including you were in rakeesha
1568307 i was but then when i heard that the east side of the city was being attacked i got my gear and fled but when i started walking i saw some undead marching towards our home and your father teleported us to the safety of a cave but we werent there for much time and fled when we saw some of our allies and they helped us to escape rakeesha and settled in gahara
1568308 no not all your brother died when he was helping gaharas militia
1568309 he fought well ishan we and our allies were proud of him for standing his ground and helped defending the city with his life but dont worry he got a worthy funeral of a half draco
1568310 your parents must be worried sick about you how about we go and talk more about this along the way
1568311 not that i recall we better see the elder in gahara he might have more information about this that we have
1568312 oh and by the way i cant fly i lost my ability to fly when i got hit in one of the wings
1568313 dont you worry about it the elder will surely heal it and youll be soring the skies once more
1568314 we can play reverend wrights sermons on every channel every day and talk about them from now until the election and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the american people think that i somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words

1568331 even if it seems as though chinas economic demand run has slowed some those changes at the margins still make them a huge consumer of crude products
1568332 elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1568333 anytime you get that kind of violent price action in a short amount of time it reeks of someone big being in trouble
1568334 who is there for instance in our times who can devote himself with an easy mind to music friendship games or happiness
1568335 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
1568336 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
1568337 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
1568338 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
1568339 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
1568340 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
1568341 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
1568342 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
1568343 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
1568344 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

1568390 it is anticipated that by the year 2005 50 of households in the us alone will be involved in a home based business
1568391 would you happen to know the time o by the wat that a great watch how do you think the yanks are doing this year and so on and so on
1568392 i rushed down to the dressing room and there was plante looking in the mirror and separating the cut up into his nostril
1568393 its best to take it slow coming back ive been working out and feeling fine except for the headaches
1568394 technically i should have it on for another week or two
1568395 i dont think that theres any doubt that it helps if we all just stay in our neighborhoods and never come out then youre never going to be able to see anything or recognize something that would be out of place
1568396 anytime you start a neighborhood watch group crime will decrease it just does or it goes away
1568397 theyd run back to their car and go to the next house and somebody actually witnessed it called police and they were able to catch them and they found just a ton of stuff in the car and were able to arrest them and book them
1568398 this is a textbook example of how business taxes evolve into
1568399 emphasis added the first recourse of state funded health systems politicians love levies on business because they disguise the overall bill from voters but such taxes are merely passed along to workers in the form of reduced take home pay since all health costs are part of compensation

1568410 yeah and im really hoping ill be on his team but anyway i held up enough of your time see you later
1568411 you shouldnt wear such a heavy coat like that in the summer time you should save it for winter or going on missions up north
1568412 so naruto kun is there anything you want to talk about
1568413 its about my bloodline limit and my inheritance to the namikaze estates
1568414 ok im asking that you make sure my being a namikaze secret from the public until i make chunin and also my bloodline will be made public that day as well since ill be using it in the chunin exams no doubt
1568415 and what makes you so sure youll be chunin by the end of the exams
1568416 ill make sure of it and im pretty sure the council will have my back like it or not
1568417 it wont be the kaguya bloodline anymore itll be the namikaze bloodline
1568418 ill talk to the council youll have nothing to worry about
1568419 all right old man today is the day i defeat you and become hokage
1568420 you cant call me that im the honorable grandson of the third hokage
1568421 hey hina chan i see you got rid of that coat you look prettier without it
1568422 ok today is the day at last today is the day you become full fledged shinobi but let me tell you this forget about your little crushes that are far beyond your reach the shinobi world is harsh and cold silly crushes wont get you anywhere in the shinobi world you are expected to kill fight and ultimately die for your country and your beliefs
1568423 but you will have friends and allies along the way making things a lot less harsh than it really is but one day your friend may be your enemy so if any of you think that you dont have what it takes to be a shinobi hand me your hitai ates and leave
1568424 ok so lets get started team 1 will be consisted of
1568425 naruto you baka nobody knows what team theyll be on until iruka sensei calls them right sasuke kun
1568426 team 8 will be consisted of hinata hyuga shino aburame and kiba inuzuka
1568427 team 9 is still cycling from last year so team 10 will consist of ino yamanaka shikamaru nara and choji akamichi your jonin sensei will be asuma sarutobi
1568428 ok class your senseis will meet with you after lunch so get out of here and eat
1568429 so enough about me how bout our students do you think hinata will work well with kiba kurenai she isnt very fond of him
1568430 ill have to work something out later so what about that sakura girl do you think shell make good assassin material if all things sure hinata would make a better one than her
1568431 no hinata is too soft hearted shes better at tracking anyway and if sakura isnt cut out to be an assassin ill let hokage sama know
1568432 but i dont see why hokage sama wouldnt let me be the sensei of your team i wouldve made a great sensei
1568433 sorry kakashi but we have to go now our teams await
1568434 naruto baka how did you get up here so fast
1568435 im itachi uchiha i like my brothers and my surrogate father i hate the man who destroyed my clan and people who threaten my brothers my goal is to reestablish the uchiha police force and rebuild the clan
1568436 im naruto uzumaki i like my brothers my dad and hina chan i dislike those who are too shallow to see people for who they are and people who hate other for what they have my dream is to establish a new clan with my kekkei genkai and be hokage
1568437 yes he does hes the last of his clan like sasuke and i
1568438 oh sorry im sakura haruno my likes are turns to sasuke and blushes my dislikes are ino pig and naruto baka
1568439 and my goals revolve around turns to sasuke and blushes
1568440 im sasuke uchiha i like my brothers hina chan and my surrogate father i hate the man who eliminated the uchiha clan and my goal is to rebuild the clan and form a clan alliance with a future clan
1568441 the team is certainly stronger now and better prepared psychologically to play in a final
1568442 we have to win this first match because we know we will have other difficult ones ahead
1568443 its going to be a difficult match but we need at least a tie we need to give our best from the beginning
1568444 the olympics is a big deal in america in many ways a bigger deal than the world cup and the players are in good spirits and ready to go
1568445 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
1568446 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
1568447 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
1568448 with the growing number of attacks and an expansive reach one could argue al qaeda is even growing stronger
1568449 we are winning the war on terror in fact weve almost won the war on terror
1568450 measuring the total number of terrorist attacks globally from a us national security perspective is meaningless because most of those groups are not targeting the united states
1568451 to be effective against terrorism in many ways requires the same things that are needed to be effective against crime its knowing neighborhoods good intelligence and on the ground information exactly the kind of information we lacked in iraq the first three years of the operation
1568452 this is whats so difficult about terrorism its a blend of political and just plain old criminal justice stuff
1568453 the adversarys real center of gravity is its narrative and we have to find ways to facilitate it falling on its own weight
1568454 al qaeda has made its colors very clear people see it for what it is a violent ideology that will kill anything and everything in its way to meet its so called objective
1568455 its unraveling even some of the intellectual thinkers within the movement are peeling away the justification and credibility of al qaedas narrative
1568456 the british have long since dropped any reference to a war on terror in part because of their long standing experience fighting the irish republican army
1568457 where they became increasingly successful is when they started using special branch their counter terrorism police force as well as mi 5 their domestic intelligence service its the use of those two actors together that really helped penetrate the ira not the military
1568458 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
1568459 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
1568460 americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pak afghan border
1568461 in the strongest evidence based confrontation with the american security establishment since the two countries established their post 9 11 strategic alliance pakistani officials proved brahamdagh bugtis presence in afghan intelligence safe houses in kabul his photographed visits to new delhi and his orders for terrorism in balochistan
1568462 we wanted to know when our american friends would get interested in tracking down the terrorists responsible for hundreds of suicide bombings in pakistan and those playing havoc with our natural resources in balochistan while sitting in kabul and delhi
1568463 the aim of raw is to keep internal disturbances flaring up and the isi preoccupied so that pakistan can lend no worthwhile resistance to indian designs in the region
1568464 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1568465 we wanted to know when our american friends would get interested in tracking down the terrorists responsible for hundreds of suicide bombings in pakistan and those playing havoc with our natural resources in balochistan while sitting in kabul and delhi
1568466 the aim of raw is to keep internal disturbances flaring up and the isi preoccupied so that pakistan can lend no worthwhile resistance to indian designs in the region
1568467 having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1568468 the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game
1568469 its for growing the game around the world and something we can all do together
1568470 the value for the players is that the more people that play around the world the more people will be watching theyll be paid back eventually
1568471 i want to watch the olympic sports where basically professionals are playing
1568472 where that is the absolute pinnacle of their career and they had to wait four years for this one moment and they go out and they perform break a world record win a gold medal and they were able to perform on the spot
1568473 im not competing until next year so ive got another five months to kill
1568474 this one is more frustrating because im the two time defending champion
1568475 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1568476 mike and i both agreed monday night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1568477 mit dem olympischen gedanken hat das nicht viel zu tun
1568478 es ist uns wichtig eigene kameras im stadion zu haben
1568479 this is a moment i have long waited for after more than 15 years of discussions and four and a half years of construction our magnificent embassy will be officially dedicated by the president
1568480 with a platform appropriate for the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century the u s china relationship
1568481 its been an absolutely awesome rebound in a short time
1568482 good rain and snow has allowed us to come a long way in just a year
1568483 i think the citys comprehensive and strict measures to control pollution have paid off
1568484 i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1568485 she thought the other girl liked me and she got into arguing with her about that a couple days ago
1568486 i told her to stay away from her and they started it back up today
1568487 its not unheard of for unattended or easy to get to pets to be taken by mountain lions in areas from boulder to evergreen
1568488 a lion that will brazenly go into someones bedroom we need to be careful of
1568489 one of the best pure athletes in the big east
1568490 well i can do a 360 but i cant end it with a tomahawk because my hands are too small to palm the basketball
1568491 i know i am blessed with a lot of god given talent and i am thankful every day for it but now it is up to me to make sure it doesnt go to waste
1568492 im a man of my word ill be a panther
1568493 obviously when you see a guy with that kind of speed and athleticism and talent it is pretty impressive
1568494 you talk about world class speed and you combine that with his height and the fact that he can jump and the fact that hes physical and its impressive but that doesnt mean he is a great football player it means he is a gifted athlete so he needs to work at it because hes young
1568495 it didnt matter if i falled as long as i get to play again
1568496 the intent of this ordinance is to try to smear protesters and make them look as if they are somehow criminal or somehow going to engage in some kind of gross conduct
1568497 reggae adalah nama genre musik sedangkan rasta atau singkatan dari rastafari adalah sebuah pilihan jalan hidup way of life
1568498 di sini penggemar musik reggae atau sering salah kaprah disebut rastafarian diidentikkan dengan pengisap ganja dan bergaya hidup semaunya tanpa tujuan
1568499 para anggota the wailers band asli bob marley tidak ada yang merokok merokok menyalahi ajaran rastafari
1568500 misalnya waktu saya tanya mereka tentang marcus garvey dan haile selassie mereka tidak tahu padahal itu adalah dua tokoh utama dalam ajaran rastafari
1568501 masalahnya bukan pada uang tetapi praktik seperti itu tidak adil
1568502 jadi kami memberontak terhadap ketidakadilan tetapi tidak antikemapanan kalau reggae tumbuh maka di indonesia tidak akan ada perang indonesia akan tersenyum dengan reggae
1568503 osama bin laden berlindung dengan kelompok etnik yang sepaham dengannya
1568504 sebagai ikon dan sutradara yang kreatif osama bin laden bisa disamakan dengan che guevara al qaeda
1568505 osama bin laden tentunya sudah tidak lagi secara sendiri merencanakan serangan teroris namun untuk masalah internal jaringan beberapa kelompok yang tergabung di al qaeda masih tetap mengharapkan keterliban peran osama bin laden

1568524 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1568525 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1568526 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1568527 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1568528 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1568529 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1568538 she assured us that she had done what she promised
1568539 to say that she had been taken into custody only on july 17 2008 is a blatant lie
1568540 the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth

1568556 el deseo de enterarse o no tiene que ver con la estructura de cada persona con su historia familiar y con saber qu se puede hacer y qu no si no se puede hacer nada genera mucha angustia y es l gica la duda sobre si tiene sentido conocer la predisposici n a un problema sin soluci n
1568557 la gente busque respuestas m gicas a los problemas de salud
1568558 uno tiene derecho a enterarse de sus riesgos no lo cuestiono pero quienes buscan informaci n en general no tienen los elementos para manejarla y pueden caer en manos de intereses econ micos m s que de organismos interesados en promover la salud las pruebas gen ticas tienen que estar reguladas para evitar efectos negativos
1568559 a uno le dicen que tiene 40 por ciento de probabilidades de contraer algo y entonces va a empezar un tratamiento sabemos que se han detectado genes relacionados con ciertas predisposiciones pero el componente gen tico est exagerado por razones comerciales si soy una empresa que hace pruebas para detectar genes predisponentes a la obesidad por ejemplo no me importa si la gente no tiene espacio para correr o come mal yo simplemente detecto ese gen y contribuyo a que se piense que la obesidad es una enfermedad gen tica lo mismo ocurre con el c ncer hoy no sabemos a qu contaminantes estamos expuestos pero nadie se ocupa de eso en cambio de las pruebas gen ticas s y sin embargo en el mundo tenemos m s casos de c ncer por razones ambientales y de estilo de vida que por cuestiones gen ticas
1568560 no quedan dudas de que la informaci n gen tica deber a incorporarse con m s frecuencia en el cuidado de la salud y que estos tests ser n con el tiempo m s accesibles
1568561 una de nuestras mayores preocupaciones es que los pacientes puedan interpretar correctamente los resultados y los ayudamos a pensar en las consecuencias que tiene hacerse un test y a tomar decisiones con respecto a su salud
1568562 hay que analizar estos saltos como un pelda o m s como producto de la baja de costos en la secuenciaci n en tres a os los vamos a tener en el hospital p blico y claro que tambi n se trata de un negocio pero es una herramienta que si est en buenas manos es til porque brinda informaci n para decidir la mayor a de la gente mira los resultados y no entiende nada ah es donde tiene que jugar el rol del m dico
1568563 pareciera que es inevitable que el examen gen tico se generalice pero lo grave es que se convierta en una mercanc a que se aleja del esp ritu m dico y cl nico en alguna medida es similar a quienes venden paquetes tur sticos que incluyen tratamientos de reproducci n asistida se da un viraje de una concepci n m dico paciente a otra m s de clientela
1568564 es informaci n que se tiene que manejar con mucho cuidado porque no estamos hablando de la probabilidad de tener una gripe y es importante respetar tambi n el derecho del paciente a no enterarse
1568565 yo veo un problema en que no haya una relaci n humana en el medio crean una falsa expectativa de que uno puede ser independiente en las decisiones que toma recibir un diagn stico no es algo puramente estad stico hay otros elementos en juego y hay una responsabilidad tica posterior al informe que no puede ser omitida el sistema de salud tiene que acompa ar y hacer un seguimiento de esa persona
1568566 c mo vive una persona mientras no se le manifiesta un mal sobre el que tom conocimiento adem s hay que saber comunicar y predecir el impacto no es lo mismo si se trata de un jefe de familia de un hogar con tres hijos que de una persona que vive sola si hay un c rculo familiar que tambi n puede estar en riesgo o si el tratamiento es muy costoso
1568567 cada test est acompa ado de recomendaciones acerca de c mo compartir los resultados con los miembros de la familia los genes son un asunto familiar y nosotros explicamos c mo se puede comunicar la informaci n de una manera positiva
1568568 hay gente que no quiere que se entere la familia dice pecci esa persona necesita de alguien que pueda acompa arlo en ese tramo de su vida no se puede generalizar en el hospital de cl nicas hemos tenido casos de gente con una enfermedad gen tica como huntington enfermedad degenerativa del sistema nervioso hereditaria y por lo general mortal que igual decide tener hijos pero ni las estad sticas ni un manual de comunicaci n resuelven eso
1568569 en la argentina pr cticamente no hay legislaci n al respecto aunque los genetistas suelen tener bastante claros los l mites ticos por ejemplo en lo que hace al abuso del test prenatal
1568570 en el que tengamos una nueva diferencia social una clase media y una clase alta que planifiquen su maternidad y eviten hijos con problemas gen ticos mientras que una mujer de pocos recursos dif cilmente vaya a evaluar este tipo de decisiones por lo que los problemas gen ticos severos podr an reducirse s lo a las clases bajas
1568571 la brecha ya existe con enfermedades como la tubercolosis que hoy s lo aparece en las clases marginadas como en las comunidades tobas aunque tambi n en las clases altas se trasladan algunas mutaciones porque somos la nica raza que no hace selecci n natural
1568572 en la argentina se vaya a usar en ex menes preocupacionales o en el caso de los seguros de salud ya que ser a un motivo de discriminaci n y est penado
1568573 un test gen tico puede sugerir que hay un riesgo creciente para una determinada condici n y as un empleado puede reducirlo a partir de los resultados
1568574 la discriminaci n existe con o sin gen tica acaso no se discrimina con los tests psicot cnicos si todos tuvi ramos el genoma secuenciado como si fuese una c dula de identidad son tantas las variables que juegan en el medio ambiente que la gen tica quedar a en un segundo plano
1568575 todo contacto con el sistema de salud acarrea riesgos cada vez que uno se hace un an lisis o va al m dico su plan de salud tiene acceso a esos datos son registros auditables y est dentro de la normativa del seguro de salud lo que implica el riesgo de discriminaci n gen tica dice el precio que se pag por resguardar la privacidad de los datos de las personas es un control social muy alto
1568576 el problema ac es la ignorancia no hay a qui n recurrir y a los profesionales de salud id neos en gen tica se los puede contar con los dedos de la mano
1568577 los genetistas y los m dicos son los que tienen que poner las cartas sobre la mesa concluye luna detr s de la importaci n de tecnolog a y de cierta neutralidad t cnica alguien se tiene que hacer cargo de lo que puede pasar
1568578 i think the consensus of opinion was that he wasnt given an adequate opportunity to prepare himself to come here

1568588 it makes the defendant much more likely to cooperate because ultimately what we are looking for is information about who the other gang members are and the structure and organizations of the gang
1568589 any additional help we can get as to what the gangs are involved in and who the players are is a definite asset to us all
1568590 with their enhanced sentencing theyre a major part in the fight against gang violence that we have here in the city
1568591 we are definitely making more than just a dent we are taking some serious offenders off the streets but the problem is still getting worse
1568592 the police can stop crime but if they dont know where the crime is being committed at they dont know how to do it
1568593 its just not always about that durham has a problem with crime its the fact that we deal with issues and we want as many people and as many partners as we can have
1568594 we certainly remain hopeful that there will be shifts to accommodate the civil aviation growth that has been forecast
1568595 around the clock in house border police and customs clearance security checks baggage screening and metal detection capabilities for fast secure passenger and baggage handling
1568596 i had to hold my bare feet up while a young security officer waved a metal detecting rod around the top bottom and sides of them
1568597 those are my feet i helpfully pointed out to her for the olympics she said with what looked like a smile
1568598 there was a lot of faith involved the faith of my mother the faith of my friends and my own faith
1568599 sometimes that was all there was to hang onto unfortunately it took 25 years to come into play
1568600 once they got started i think they just could not turn off the machine

1568602 the antenna stands about 8 feet high and straddles the width of the runway
1568603 there is no single focus at this point it is a multiple focus accident investigation
1568604 we see this time and time again an accident occurs with air taxis or corporate airplanes and recorders were not required to be installed forcing ntsb accident investigators into a search for other data such as radar tapes from air traffic control to infer what happened
1568605 a supposition however well educated is simply not good enough
1568606 this is street ra dio for unsung heroes ridin in they regal tryin to stay legal my daughter found nemo i found the new primo yeah you know how we do we do it for the people and the struggles of the brothas and the folks
1568607 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
1568608 it was a bad pitch to barajas a bad pitch to mench
1568609 its frustrating really frustrating wed lost seven in a row and had three outs to get to a win im frustrated with myself
1568610 even though this is a horrible outing and poor timing with everything thats going on with the team with the losing streak and me personally with the situation as the teams closer weve got to put this behind us its going to be difficult to sleep no doubt about it but when i wake up tomorrow its over
1568611 stay insdie shit gonna happen no work today omgwegonnadie 1one
1568612 just pay the fuckin 11 difference for crying out loud
1568613 i wish we were like 10 games up or 20 games down then id get a 10 game suspension
1568614 but my team is going through a pretty tough time right now and i have to be with them 100 percent i let my club down for two days
1568615 i believe that based on that and more information the commissioners office saw fit to be a bit more reasonable than they were and they understand the situation
1568616 he touched me i cant touch you you cant touch me either but no he said i bumped him right before that situation
1568617 after you see greinke hit swisher that clicks in your mind like whats going on here
1568618 you start looking around like are they abusing my team or do they think were scared
1568619 dont look into any of these decisions that weve made right now
1568620 its a starting spot and theres no rhyme or reason as to why were going this direction its just the way i want to go right now
1568621 i think the last four or five practices ive been sharp
1568622 i just keep on getting better and that was my goal going into camp im glad i wanted to come out and start i feel real confident right now
1568623 i really dont have an opinion on how it came down
1568624 but im excited about being live thats how you get in game mode
1568625 the last time i had a knee scope i was practicing in 11 days
1568626 were not in a panic mode we have a couple of training camp injuries that just about every team in the league has right now
1568627 ibu hanya rindu pada bumi tempat ari ari ibu dikubur bumi yang sudah berulang ulang kuceritakan padamu tidakkah kamu bosan anak perempuanku
1568628 burik beranak pinak dan seekor anaknya adalah bebek yang burik sayang dan dilindungi seperti anaknya sendiri tiap kali orang mendekati bebek tiap kali pula burik menaikkan sayapnya dan berlari siap mencengkram
1568629 burik disembelih dagingnya nenek buat opor untuk lauk makan kami
1568630 saat itu kamera masih langka semuanya ibu abadikan di sini
1568631 dengarkan saja cerita cerita ibu mintalah ibu bercerita jika kamu ingin
1568632 maukah kau menemani ibu ke bumi tempat ari ari ibu dikubur
1568633 ibu pernah menjatuhkan seluruh perasaan dan harapan hanya untuknya ibu ikhlas diusir dari bumi tempat ari ari ibu dikubur karena mereka tidak setuju ibu menikah dengan pria asing beda keyakinan
1568634 ibu tabung sisa penghasilan yang tak seberapa siapa tahu ibu bisa melancong ke bumi lain
1568635 kami saling jatuh cinta kami saling tergila gila kebesaran cinta itulah yang membawa ibu ke negeri ini
1568636 kakek bilang ibu boleh pulang kalau ibu sudah bercerai dengan papamu
1568637 aku tak mengerti mengapa nenek dan kakek sekejam itu bukankah papa juga manusia
1568638 nenek dan kakek menganggap aib besar anak gadisnya menikah dengan pria asing berlainan keyakinan
1568639 bu apakah nenek dan kakek akan menerima kehadiran ibu kehadiranku
1568640 ibu bahagia memilikumu bahagia melewati musim demi musim bersamamu bahagia melihatmu tumbuh dewasa musim panas nanti maukah menemani ibu pulang ke bumi tempat ari ari ibu dikubur
1568641 aku suka teman baru tapi berat hati meninggalkan teman lama
1568642 kau bisa jadi pemain sinetron muncul di televisi dan populer
1568643 tinggalah di sini bersamaku aku akan menjaga ibu seperti orang di negeri ibu menjaga orangtuanya
1568644 kembalilah ke bumi tempat ari ari ibu dikubur jika itu membuat ibu bahagia aku berjanji akan mengunjungi ibu
1568645 ibu dan papa berjanji akan menyimpannya hanya untuk kami berdua
1568646 mengapa cinta ibu dan papa yang semula mendasar mendalam hilang
1568647 lebih baik kau mencari tahu bagaimana orang lain sukses memelihara cinta dan kesetiaan
1568648 ibu menghanyutkan ari arimu di sungai ini membungkusnya dengan dua bendera negara
1568649 ari arimu mungkin singgah di berbagai benua mungkin kini menetap di bawah laut atau alien telah membawa ari arimu ke luar angkasa

1568654 sepeninggal caroline aku pasti akan seperti merpati tua yang rapuh dan kehilangan keinginan untuk sekadar menggerakkan sayap aku pasti seperti tinggal di sebuah rumah yang dipenuhi oleh cahaya sembilan matahari
1568655 kalau caroline mati pasti tak lama lagi aku juga akan mati
1568656 jadi sebaiknya mumpung masih hidup perlakukan caroline sebagaimana kau dan rosa menyayangi aku
1568657 kalau yesus masih hidup kalau tak dililit oleh sembilan naga dari selatan di kayu salib raja bukit golgota itu pasti akan menolong caroline jadi jika kau ingin meniru putra nazareth itu ayolah ajak rosa atau siapa pun untuk mendanai kami masa pada musim dingin yang membekukan tubuh kau tega membiarkan kami tidur di emperan jack in the box atau burger king
1568658 aku sering mengintip mereka caroline suka sekali mengulum bibir ibumu di kamar mandi oo mereka sungguh sungguh pasangan yang dahsyat jika tak ada pengawas mereka suka tidur bersama dalam satu selimut hmm kalau sudah seperti itu aku sering membayangkan ada sepasang naga yang bergumul di langit tebal warna kelabu dengus dan desis mereka sungguh membuat kami yang telah kehilangan gairah hidup menjadi tak ingin mati esok pagi o rafli yang tampan apakah kau tetap akan membiarkan mereka bercinta sepanjang hari sepanjang malam
1568659 tidak ada seorang pun di panti wreda yang tak tertarik pada caroline rafli john suami nora pun kerap menggoda perempuan indah itu saat bersama ibumu ia melenggang ke taman dan angela lesbian tengik itu ingin mendekap sendiri perempuan yang digandrungi karena itu jangan heran jika ia sangat membenci tari ibumu
1568660 andai tak ada mereka mungkin aku hanya akan menghabiskan waktuku di kasino kasino las vegas ya berjudi kau tahu lebih memberiku kesempatan untuk mengekspresikan kesedihan dan kegembiraan ketimbang bercakap cakap dengan para sheriff bloon di bar bar di hadapan mesin slot dan meja permainan berornamen elang aku memang bisa tertawa atau nangis sesenggukan itu sebabnya aku tak mau mengurung diri dan hidup bersama orang orang gagu di panti wreda tapi sejak mengenal ibumu dan caroline aku jadi kerasan mendengarkan cerita cerita aneh mereka mengenai naga sungai sungai yang dihuni harimau berkepala gajah atau apa pun yang bisa membuatku lupa pada kucuran darah para remaja jawa yang kepalanya kupenggal di sembarang tempat
1568661 kudengar semua orang di panti wreda tak mau bicara denganmu buijsen juga caroline dan ibuku
1568662 ya mereka tak mau bergaul denganku karena takut aku akan membantai siapa pun dengan senapan tua
1568663 itu karena aku memang kerap bercerita atau ndremimil tentang pembantaian pembantaian yang kulakukan di maguwo padahal kau tahu sebagian besar kekejian yang kulakukan hanyalah karanganku belaka yang benar benar terjadi sebelum migrasi ke amerika aku dan para serdadu belanda yang tengik dan pengecut bersembunyi di sebuah gua sunyi penuh pepohonon rimbun di kaki gunung merapi saat terjadi serangan umum yang dipimpin oleh sultan
1568664 mereka bilang di tempat itu santa maria menggendong bayi bercahaya diiringi tujuh malaikat dan sembilan naga selalu muncul setelah senja tiba mereka juga bilang burung burung dari bulan selalu menyertai perjalanan perempuan suci itu
1568665 karena itu percayalah padaku rafli mereka adalah sepasang malaikat yang dikirimkan dari surga untuk menyelamatkan kami orang orang tua yang diabaikan oleh anak anak dengan katakanlah cerita cerita tentang keajaiban keajaiban mawar dan anggrek iblis harum serta warna senja aneh yang sekali waktu akan muncul di pantai redondo atau santa monica apakah kau pernah melihat burung burung seagull di kedua pantai itu rafli
1568666 caroline dan tari sangat senang memandang langit yang membentang di atas laut kata mereka setelah seseorang mencapai usia lebih daripada 71 tahun ia akan dapat melihat wajahnya sendiri di antara gumpalan awan
1568667 ya mereka juga mengatakan seperti itu kepadaku apakah sampean juga telah bisa melihat wajah sampean yang lucu
1568668 wah kalau begitu sampean belum benar benar menemukan inti kehidupan
1568669 ya inti kehidupan buijsen lahir setelah orang bisa menyembunyikan diri yang buruk ke ceruk sedalam kakus inti kehidupan lahir jika sampean bisa menatap topeng aneh sampean di sebalik gumpalan awan
1568670 mengapa kautangisi sesuatu yang sudah seharusnya mampus pada saat hitler membakar para cecunguk yahudi
1568671 o putri anggrek yang cantik mereka toh tak tahu betapa aku dan caroline sedang mempersiapkan perkawinanmu dengan pangeran mawar dan kini caroline telah meninggalkan kita apakah kau tetap ingin bercinta dengan kekasih pujaanmu
1568672 hmm mereka juga tak tahu selama ini aku dan caroline hanya berpura pura memuja santa maria mereka tak tahu betapa kami selalu mempercakapkan bagaimana cara melarikan diri dari panti wreda yang menganggap kami orang orang tua malang hanya sebagai barang rongsokan yang diberi obat tidur sepanjang hari sepanjang malam okelah putri aku selalu berdoa dan bilang pada gusti allah agar ia jangan mengambil nyawa orang orang yang baru bertemu dengan warna pagi caroline juga bilang pada allah agar ia mengambil saja nyawa orang orang yang telah menatap malam jadi tanpa diracun dengan segala obat pun kami sudah merindukan kematian
1568673 ya ya aku setuju pada pendapatmu putri anak anak kita akan selalu menganggap kita sebagai sosok yang rapuh sosok yang jika bisa segera saja dihilangkan dari mata licik mereka

1568697 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1568698 iraqi pm nuri al maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal
1568699 while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem

1568702 when i wonder did we in america ever get into this idea that freedom means having no boundaries and no limits
1568703 i think it began on the 6th of august 1945 at 8 15 am when we dropped the bomb on hiroshima somehow or other from that day on in our american life we say we want no limits and no boundaries
1568704 he went in had a brief conversation and shot the clerk
1568705 based on the video it did not appear to be an argument
1568706 while i am an optimist for the mining and resources booms i am bearish about the market for the next 12 months he said
1568707 but the stars are starting to align so we will see deals kick off when we get the mining offices and the tenants from the eastern states
1568708 it really makes you wonder at 4 per cent whether adelaides vacancy rate is high and how low it can go he said
1568709 in the current environment with the credit squeeze finance is virtually dried up debt is a problem so it is difficult to get projects off the ground he said
1568710 there is a dearth of construction in the pipeline going forward

1568719 she the grandmother is very disturbed as the child cannot be taken out of the country because of adoption laws the childs mother yuki who divorced her husband and disowned the child turned down her request to visit india to complete the adoption process the grandmother becomes very emotional when she is told that the child cannot be taken out of india the lawmakers will have to find some solution to this
1568720 we want candidates with criminal records to be barred from contesting elections for that the government has to pass a law which has not been done yet there is a need to do a lot more to see that criminals are barred from elections
1568721 i feel it is on the decrease because of certain measures taken by the commission like compulsory filling of affidavits by candidates about their pasts
1568722 in the next general election the electoral rolls itself will have photographs of voters hopefully it will work to eliminate bogus voters
1568723 the time was not ripe for making voting compulsory in india
1568724 this is surprising since an earlier thermal and evolved gas analyzer measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate

1568728 we are naming it eve after my mother eve branson but also because it represents a first and a new beginning the chance for our ever growing group of future astronauts and other scientists to see our world in a completely new light
1568729 lets go 20 years forward if all of this goes to plan i hope that we will have a hotel in space and in that hotel i hope we will have small spaceships that can go around the moon
1568730 it might be naive of me but perversely i think i might have more chance in europe than i do in my own country
1568731 ive lost two jobs because of this my bosses just didnt want to be associated with the publicity
1568732 right now id be quite glad of a two year delay

1568747 she was a gymnast and that showed she had the power and the flexibility and the body line
1568748 i could sleep or listen to my ipod while she was doing all that driving
1568749 if i dont like it maybe ill move back to the training center

1568761 he basically ripped me hey im a public figure too im a little more public now
1568762 i wish shed realize how damaging it is to an entire gender when she carries herself in that manner it sets us all back to a time where female sports reporters were all seen as husband hunters who were only in the business to catch a cheap glance
1568763 if anything i think these guys look at me like a little sister or one of the guys i dont look at myself as a sex object ive never carried myself in that way im a girl that loves sports
1568764 she is a fellow journalist and she deserved the right to make a comment
1568765 that i had put a couple of paragraphs in about all the women in sports journalism who comport themselves differently from andrews

1568769 last year 170 countries voted in favour of japans un resolution calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons only three countries the united states among them opposed this resolution
1568770 we need to pass that message on to our childrens generation
1568771 the nilotic negroes who live in extreme heat particularly in summer may turn out to be the worlds leanest people
1568772 i think theres a video room there now it was perfect because someone spilled paint on the ground but it wasnt us but that served as one base and then there was another tiny manhole cover for some pipe work and that served as another base

1568782 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1568783 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1568784 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1568785 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1568786 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1568787 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1568788 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1568789 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1568790 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1568791 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1568792 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1568793 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1568794 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1568795 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1568796 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1568797 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1568798 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1568799 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1568800 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1568801 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1568802 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1568803 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1568804 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1568805 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1568806 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1568807 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1568808 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1568809 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1568810 strong content is universally valued its hard work to create it but in the long run it generates lots of long term referral traffic
1568811 takes five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master
1568812 arms of great length and power eyes bright blue hair yellow face long and beard thin and his small lips wearing a kindly smile
1568813 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
1568814 the iocs priority is to ensure that as many people as possible get to experience the magic of the olympic games and the inspirational sporting achievements of the olympic athletes
1568815 for the first time in olympic history we will have complete global online coverage and the ioc will have its own broadcast channel which will make fantastic olympic footage available where young generations of sports fans are already going for online entertainment
1568816 the olympic games are not that credible or relevant to most young people in the developed or developing world
1568817 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street
1568818 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
1568819 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks
1568820 there might be one or two things that havent leaked yet
1568821 no one should even think they know the subject of the talk
1568822 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades and none of us saw it until dan put it all together
1568823 i mean i hope not do it desire is the doer i am not the doer desire is the agent i am not the agent o desire here this oblation to you
1568824 o gods all your names and forms are to be revered saluted and adored
1568825 charge the cup of water with fresh clean energy imagine a bolt of white light entering the clear water
1568826 as it burns write your troubles cares concerns fears peeves angers and anything else on the parchment paper dont edit just let it all flow out dont try to write pretty write as angrily as you need to
1568827 when you feel that all the energy has been poured into the paper and you cant think of anything else to write down light the paper from the candle and drop it in the cauldron as the paper burns feel all the negativity float away all is gone know that you are recharged and refreshed make sure that everything in the cauldron burns away use your lighter to char any remaining scraps of paper
1568828 pour the ashes outside on the earth or into a moving body of water such as a river or ocean
1568829 weve actually brought all of the power of symantecs nac agent for managed systems and put up that for the unmanaged world
1568830 some of the competing solutions will take the user to a web page and say youre not on the network because your antivirus isnt up to date so click on this url
1568831 the idea is to keep the network safe by keeping impurely configured systems off the network
1568832 we now have the capability of giving them different levels of access
1568833 this is important because most enterprises are interested in giving as little access to the network as necessary for example they might want to offer internet access as a courtesy to casual guests vendors or the board of directors if anything changes they will get kicked off the network
1568834 in addition to creating more awareness of our online presence in latin america as well as the journal brand this arrangement greatly expands our capabilities to assist advertisers in reaching one of the most affluent and influential audiences in latin america
1568835 we are thrilled to expand our relationship with dow jones
1568836 we continue to pursue global affluent consumers and influential decision makers around the world and doing so in spanish and portuguese two of the top 10 languages online will help us reach more of them
1568837 limos consensual governance model and balanced collaborative development methodology have set it apart from other platform initiatives and continue to garner wide industry support
1568838 these 11 new members will join the development of a consistent and competitive global handset os operating system within which the collaborative benefits of shared cost and innovation are realized and upon which diverse commercially driven differentiation freely thrives
1568839 limo greatly appreciates the commitment to openness and collaboration taken by all of our new members todays announcement includes several former lips forum participants that have chosen to redirect their resources into limo in order to drive unification of the mobile ecosystem
1568840 limos broad industry engagement demonstrates the fact that limo offers an open transparent and equitable opportunity for established industry players and newcomers alike to shape and drive innovation within the limo platform

1568843 the player is very disappointed and i am very frustrated
1568844 i am not jose mourinho so why compare me with him
1568845 mourinho says i will win ten championships i dont say i will win ten i say i will try
1568846 i will never do that never you are the man who must take responsibility
1568847 i want to make chelsea loved around the world like barcelona and manchester united
1568848 its a surprise for me that people say chelsea are unpopular because when we went to china they cry for chelsea they love chelsea its a big surprise people dont like us in england
1568849 in russia in malaysia its better but maybe not yet in brazil or south america
1568850 its become apparent to me we need to do this
1568851 ive never seen things as difficult as theyve been in the last year
1568852 its been a multitude of things that brought it to this meeting tonight
1568853 i would like to see an elected mayor with no administrative duties
1568854 wed still have the same council structure and same mayoral position but with no administrative duties citizens are better served when all representatives play a part rather than one individual
1568855 i firmly believe this is something we need to do
1568856 in a nutshell they did not balance their checkbook they did not compare their bank statements to the books the county keeps
1568857 in a nutshell the auditors noted they werent as regular about their bank reconciliations as we would have liked for them to be
1568858 we didnt find any findings for recovery or instances where they misspent tax dollars that need to be repaid or anything like that there werent any huge egregious issues because of this but certainly it is something they need to improve for their next audit
1568859 a variance between the financial institutions balance and the county treasurers cash balance of 813 456
1568860 all they found so far and they may still be looking is 226 000
1568861 this was over a period of august until the end of the year for 2007 it wasnt this offices problem it was a bank problem
1568862 during the process of gathering information to prepare the countys financial report for 2007 it came to our attention that the treasurer has not balanced the main checking account since may 2007
1568863 by these deposits not being paid in the departments they belong to did not have access to this money for expenditures and may not balance for grant reporting
1568864 indicated that she has little desire to make this a priority
1568865 although we are always willing to provide assistance when necessary it is ultimately the responsibility of the treasurer to make sure the account balance s monthly
1568866 i dont recall getting a copy this was back in march
1568867 we were trying to get the second or first half tax collection over with and i had little desire to make this a priority
1568868 i dont care for that at all thats not larry beidelschies thats someone else talking i dont remember receiving it this is a political thing this is a political year and im up for re election we did have a meeting over this i believe
1568869 are they going to be fined or arrested or anything for these findings no

1568872 locking a mobile phone without subscribers permission is a national crime
1568873 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1568874 we have omozusi out on loan at norwich this season which is an excellent move for him to gain vital first team experience
1568875 i dont want to leave and i havent been told anything that would make me think i would be leaving its all rubbish and rumours
1568876 people ring you up and say youve been linked here and there but unless it comes from the manager you learn to just block it out
1568877 they had two shots in the second half and scored a goal we had three chances in front of goal and we didnt kill the opposing team they hit us this is what i said to the players you have one or two chances and if you dont kill the opposition in the premier league they will kill us
1568878 if you ask players around the world about me they say i like scolari because he is a true man he speaks honestly in front of you and hes very good as a person
1568879 coming on and setting up a goal i was absolutely buzzing at first i was going to shoot but then i saw jamie screaming and thought id just slide it in and luckily he scored
1568880 the gaffer just told me to go on and play my normal game keep it simple so i went on did just that and tried to relax
1568881 you make your first touch the nerves start to go and after a while you find that youre playing your normal game
1568882 its such a buzz for me to get a reception like that off the fans ive been at this club for 10 years now and to finally be involved with the first team is unbelievable
1568883 im still in a little bit of shock that i was out with the first team training with these quality players
1568884 i like arsene wenger i have known him for ten years and i like martin oneill i saw some games and his procedure is very good the way he works with the team and i think the players like him
1568885 i have also heard the players talking many good words about harry redknapp from portsmouth i hear hes a good man who does good work i have relations with arsene and juande ramos benitez only a little because i have not played against him
1568886 and sir alex ferguson sometimes because when i was with portugal we talked about cristiano whether he was coming to the national team or not injured or not and they also had nani
1568887 its not just about playing against manchester united arsenal and liverpool
1568888 i have trained with the team only a week the process of recovery is taking place normally and the injury doesnt bother me it is gratifying that the coach gave me an opportunity to get back into the rhythm of playing he told
1568889 during these two years at chelsea i had two operations and a serious back injury if i will have the opportunity to train and play without injuries i would like to leave my mark on the history of chelsea injuries constantly kept me out of action
1568890 we had a good conversation im only now getting into shape and recovering from injury so preference is given to those players who are in better form
1568891 the coach always chooses the best players in order to choose the best scheme
1568892 i need to change this mentality in the club where some players are afraid of penalties i listen and i read chelsea lost two or three competitions in the last season with penalties
1568893 if you are talking about penalties some players refuse to take one i need to change this i am the coach and i am responsible for this there are many games in the champions league carling cup fa cup which could be decided by penalties and i need all the players
1568894 nickys an experienced player hes got the respect of everyone at the club staff and players alike and he leads by example
1568895 i like that type of skipper hes not one of those who shakes his fist at everybody he just does his job and says work as hard as i do
1568896 if nelly is missing then ill be able to captain the team which will be great im pleased with it
1568897 since ive come in hes been an excellent example not just to the young lads but to everybody else
1568898 being a local lad i think its important and hes got leadership qualities i said to him it is now up to you to show me that you have those leadership qualities i see it in you it is now for you to show that with the rest of the players
1568899 on the field hes a fantastic player he can make things happen hes got responsibilities now both on and off the pitch and i just thought it was the right idea
1568900 if he does the things that i know he can do then i think hell be a great replacement to come in if ryan nelsen ever did get injured fingers crossed that wont happen or was away on international duty
1568901 but im looking for more captains i think we need to be a bit more vocal a bit more demanding of each other not in a critical way but as a whole team we need to raise the bar a bit raise the standards a bit
1568902 if the young players work hard at their game listen to the advice of the coaching staff they realise they will have every opportunity here
1568903 the manager has always said he will play them if they are good enough and he is true to his word he always has been in every way but the bar is extremely high and you have to be over it to get the opportunity
1568904 jack was given the opportunity by the manager to go on the austrian training camp along with five others who have all done really well jack has taken his chance and he is one of quite a few we have here that we have high hopes for
1568905 you have to adapt to the physical aspects of the game and i think jack is strong enough
1568906 there have been some good performances over the last few weeks
1568907 i felt we were really good against southampton we got a great win against porto and the feyenoord game was excellent
1568908 the different formation worked well against feyenoord weve used it in a few games now and the boys looked comfortable with the system
1568909 myself and massimo donati sat deeper in midfield and that allowed scott brown to get forward with aiden mcgeady and georgios samaras to support jan vennegoor of hesselink
1568910 im sure its given the manager something to think about for the season ahead
1568911 in the case we received an official offer we would carefully study it with udineses permission
1568912 the premier league is interesting for him and they are one of the best leagues in the world with the spanish and the italian ones
1568913 he did very well as captain last season and the fact he has got a seasons experience under his belt was another big plus
1568914 he showed all the leadership qualities you require from a captain and hopefully being given the role again will act as an extra incentive for him continue to do well
1568915 our hope is that while hes in china hell raise the issue of religious freedom and be an advocate for persecuted christians he has raised that issue in the past and we hope he will do it during this olympic time as well
1568916 two very prominent very outspoken house church pastors have been evicted from the city of beijing and basically told you can be detained in jail or you can leave the city until september
1568917 the question that i have and i think a lot of people have is what happens after the olympics what happens when the world media goes home and doesnt pay attention to china anymore thats the question nobody really knows the answer to
1568918 as people are watching the olympics it will serve as a constant reminder to pray for china to pray for the church there and to pray for persecuted christians there
1568919 and got all excited thinking it was reuniting him with tim roth not that damn director
1568920 what are the best games for a pirate birthday party
1568921 what is the best tech conference to attend this year
1568922 much of their equipment was outdated we committed to provide for them some training and some equipment right now pieces of the equipment are on their way to elwa and we were able to buy some computers what we are trying to help elwa to do is to maximize their already existing ability so were moving them from analog to digital
1568923 we have really good classes here but theyre really challenging
1568924 shepherds ministry i think is not only going to be able to help guide hearts but to really give hope to those with developmental disabilities that they can be successful they can be proud of an opportunity for them to really serve and make a difference in the world and in their life and shepherds college is providing that forum for them to do that
1568925 i like plants because plants and i get along so well
1568926 you get to dig holes and i love to dig
1568927 he serves down there on landscaping and the grounds and just serves the students and staff that way
1568928 my aunt goes here and theres so many cool people that i met
1568929 just yesterday i met a lot of people and it was really awesome
1568930 its just been a wonderful wonderful thing to see gods people step forward and be a part of shaping guiding and giving hope to young people like brian who are students here
1568931 the breakdown of her marriage has had a profound effect on her
1568932 the pressures of public life constant travel away from home and public scrutiny combined with motherhood is a difficult act to balance
1568933 i have spent several hours with paula in hospital since last night she is a strong person and is showing good signs
1568934 mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas health issues
1568935 paulas health recovery will be a long process and she is getting all of the support she needs with her family and friends by her side every step along the way
1568936 while everyone else is debating the all too real energy crisis its good to see democrats are obsessing over hypothetical political match ups the dnc is having fun with washington parlor games but the rest of the nation is debating the merits of mccains all of the above energy plan versus obamas inflate your tires approach
1568937 this is an important piece of the puzzle as we attempt to determine whether habitable conditions exist for microbes on mars
1568938 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1568939 this desert is a hyper arid environment that rarely sees rain and has no vascular plants and is often used by scientists as a matter of fact as a martian analog site
1568940 these compounds are quite stable in soil and water and do not destroy organic materials under normal circumstances in fact there are species of perchlorate producing microbes that live on the energy provided by this oxidant
1568941 unfortunately there was a story out that we were hiding something and of course as soon as that story goes out people speculate the speculation leads to all kinds of wonderful stories of discoveries that i wish wed made but we havent
1568942 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1568943 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1568944 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1568945 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1568946 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps
1568947 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets
1568948 we have not had any contact with them because their phones are off
1568949 at this moment the tibetans inside tibet are brutally and violently being crushed by chinese authorities
1568950 its absolutely critical that a message is sent to the chinese government to meaningfully address and end violence and repression in tibet or they will never be truly accepted by the international community
1568951 under normal circumstances if its raining anywhere the equestrian sport continues
1568952 we can only hope that the u s president elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority
1568953 hes behind but well work to get him up to speed and we know hes the kind of player who will get himself caught up
1568954 right from the start through the draft and minicamps he has shown us things that are innate to successful nfl linebackers
1568955 i want to catch up quick on what i missed and move forward as fast as i can
1568956 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine the wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1568957 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1568958 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1568959 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1568960 set up the ldp for a wipeout in the next house of representatives election
1568961 in tokyo the arrival of a recession hasnt really hit home but in the rural areas that i visited i think there is absolutely a recession
1568962 i call upon the national olympic committees and international federations to be sure that we meet the deadline of compliance
1568963 i make an appeal to governments to accelerate the ratification of the unesco treaty
1568964 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1568965 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1568966 i felt a little bit embarrassed talking about doping when my country had not signed
1568967 wada will give every assistance for all stakeholders to be compliant by november
1568968 the real onus is on the countries and sports federations to ensure that the athletes who have been sent to beijing are clean
1568969 wada the ioc and bocog beijings organizing committee cannot guarantee that all athletes at the games will not try to dope
1568970 we can be sure however that anybody who dopes risks getting caught as the testing will be more frequent and significant than at any other olympic games
1568971 oh sure feeling woozy tell it to someone who cares
1568972 estimating how much space is required for a given duration and codec is something that many video editors need to do on a regular basis our videospace widget has been proved to be a big hit with editors and were very excited to make disk space calculations available from any computer with an internet connection including iphone and ipod touch
1568973 there was a lot of faith involved the faith of my mother the faith of my friends and my own faith
1568974 sometimes that was all there was to hang onto unfortunately it took 25 years to come into play
1568975 once they got started i think they just could not turn off the machine
1568976 if we reduce our consumption of oil thats what will reduce gas prices the presumptive democratic nominee said in a one on one interview with the post crescent during a campaign stop in kaukauna
1568977 we cant drill our way out of the problem because theres just a finite amount of oil out there and
1568978 and so the way we are going to see gas prices reduced is when we start using the oil that we get more intelligently than we are doing now
1568979 i think the consensus of opinion was that he wasnt given an adequate opportunity to prepare himself to come here
1568980 the guys been snake bitten somewhat because of a variety of things that have happened to him and i think everybodys very much aware of his history
1568981 its not something that i would do unless it was an emergency situation
1568982 i think hes one of the best right fielders in the big leagues so why move him from there
1568983 to put it politely the government is not in a great position do i think the next election is lost no but we need to get ahead of the curve there are all these concerns about getting the process right getting the narrative right
1568984 considerable time discussing the case for a further rise in cash rates
1568985 this is a significant relief for gas users as well as the economy of western australia mr carpenter said
1568986 the worst of the situation is clearly over we still have a long way to go
1568987 we have constant conversations with all our customers and try to meet their needs as best we can
1568988 welcome by dt amp making the defcon 16 badge with joe
1568989 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1568990 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1568991 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1568992 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1568993 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1568994 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1568995 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1568996 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1568997 i plead with you dont waste your life male or female be like william tyndale

1569001 but not right away well be doing it next year ill produce a film and its not really a period film it would be a period film but it wont feel like one
1569002 by that i mean itd be very contemporary in terms of actions and emotions but in order to make those actions and emotions credible the plot will be set in the past part of my character might have some thugi traits but i dont play a thug as defined in the history books
1569003 id love to make films for kareena and my sister soha but i dont have to star in all my productions see initially the whole idea was to give myself a chance to produce films and do the roles i wasnt being offered
1569004 now when im in my first three production being directed by imtiaz ali sriram raghavan and homi adajania i dont mind playing just the producer in future
1569005 the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self defense in the home
1569006 would have us believe that over 200 years ago the framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons
1569007 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms
1569008 with all the news as its been im hoping there isnt some mistake and breaking news announces it was a mistake
1569009 the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
1569010 the nra is suing the city of chicago obama land and other cities with the gun ban in place
1569011 i may be a tourist but i know my hotel is in the other direction
1569012 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1569013 the inflation fight probably will have to wait until 2009
1569014 conditions at this point do not seem to dictate an immediate tightening
1569015 labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters

1569020 often trusts are created to manage private sector provident and superannuation funds but these are not managed by people as a full time job however it is on this trust that depends the financial sustainability in old age of a lot of people
1569021 in the case of india institutions that are managing large corpus of funds perhaps need lot more of professional advice lot of individuals livelihood and financial decisions are taken by people who are not necessarily professional
1569022 we will go ahead and issue the investment guidelines separately a call has to be taken on the issue of getting more professional advice

1569026 if one has to pay more on borrowings because of exchange fluctuations it does not mean the value of ones asset changes
1569027 it may be noted that the accounting treatment of exchange differences contained in this standard is required to be followed irrespective of the relevant provisions of schedule vi to the companies act 1956
1569028 what these companies ought to be doing is very clear from this notification
1569029 somebody must take up this issue so that reporting is done in the true spirit with which it ought to be done
1569030 if one has to pay more on borrowings because of exchange fluctuations it does not mean the value of ones asset changes

1569034 while all this sounds hunky dory there are big questions that operators will have to face once they launch services since india has one of the lowest average revenues per user arpu globally the demand for such services may be quite limited
1569035 i dont even know that young lady but shes going to make me cry
1569036 one more person says one more nasty thing to me and i am leaving this family
1569037 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games
1569038 the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible however the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
1569039 we are contacting the u s embassy to see what they know about it
1569040 i know a lot of people arent looking at me
1569041 the competitors who compete against me i dont think theyre overlooking me but i think a lot of the media is hyping the competition that allows me to maybe sneak in there and make things happen
1569042 i didnt sign because i didnt plan on getting injured and i still had work to do my thing was to make the team first the opportunity to make the olympic team comes around once in a lifetime and thats what i did
1569043 well hey thats called athletic sport theres been a lot of picks in a lot of venues where the underdog won and hes no underdog
1569044 does military service necessarily make a person fit for president
1569045 no i had no idea this guy was doing this im so surprised and shocked i cant believe it was in my neighborhood
1569046 of preserving and strengthening those kind and fraternal feelings which have bound together the soldiers sailors and marines who united to suppress the late rebellion
1569047 sole priority for defense spending will be protecting the american people
1569048 was not sure whether he would have voted against the resolution had he been in the u s senate
1569049 hey the new guy at the u s is stepping back from being able to defend his country so we probably ought to abandon our pursuit of weapons advanced enough to attack them
1569050 oh obama is reducing his nuclear arsenal and doesnt want us to have fissile materials so well stop now
1569051 yeah sure barry well dump some most of our weapons and get rid of our hair trigger we trust you to do the same thanks for trusting us
1569052 obama has not internalized all the deep cold war questions and ways of thinking which have characterized all significant us political leaders up to now
1569053 the great cold war questions were things such as how does the us maintain its geo strategic influence in key regions of the world what is the interaction between us military posture and other nations economic development how do you keep allies in line with grand western coalition policy what is the underlying global balance of power equation how do you manage the emergence of great powers how do you balance one power against another when is it worth embarking on a counterinsurgency campaign and when should the us just stand back from a situation
1569054 i pledge a grievance to the flag of the united states of a and the blah blah blah
1569055 why didnt you stand up with the rest of us and say the pledge
1569056 i dont say the pledge of allegiance i never have and i never will
1569057 amy you are required to say the pledge of allegiance in this school
1569058 this school is within the united states and i am
1569059 hi elizabeth im amy did you wait here for me to come out of detention
1569060 well um yeah i was well i was wondering about you know the pledge and why you didnt say it
1569061 im happy to meet you and everything but really i dont think it is anyones business why i choose not to say the pledge of allegiance its my own business and i dont need to explain it to anyone
1569062 i was just hoping you would because i never met anyone before who wouldnt say it i dont even really understand the pledge of allegiance i was hoping that talking with you about it would help me learn something
1569063 but i was really hoping youd tell me about the pledge
1569064 i am telling you about the pledge the pledge is a pledge to a flag and thats where we should start with the flag
1569065 flags are about blindly rallying to the call of murder my father blindly rallied to the call of murder behind that very flag and now hes dead i wont let them program me in to following like a lemming over the cliff
1569066 first of all they are forcing you to pledge allegiance to a republic and they dont let you vote that smacks of slavery later you will vote but for whom will you vote two political parties have a lock on the electoral process and both represent the same class the rich are you rich elizabeth
1569067 the difference between you and the rich is much bigger than the difference between you and the poor elizabeth the rich dont have to worry about working the rich have complete access to the legal system the rich can get away with things that you cannot get away with the rich do not go off and die in wars to protect their republic they send the poor and they send you
1569068 look at the president are his daughters fighting in the war have you heard
1569069 have you ever wondered why they make you repeat that pledge every day when someone takes an oath of office they do it once they dont do it every day pledges are meant to be taken once when someone has you recite something over and over every day of your life they seek to program you i bet you never thought about the words of the pledge of allegiance before have you
1569070 exactly it is a program not a pledge the daily recital of that pledge is indoctrination the nazis used indoctrination the soviets used indoctrination cults use indoctrination do you want to be a robot elizabeth
1569071 then think about what you let them do to you when the call to die for the republic of the
1569072 this is where i get off ill see you tomorrow
1569073 i do agree no one should be forced to recite a pledge of allegiance for the same reason i am opposed to forced or arranged marriages
1569074 if we are married we are responsible to our spouse through an oath voluntarily given and voluntarily enforced
1569075 sadly the answer is too many as evidenced by divorce rates single parents neglected children and a ream of social statistics that suggests some where some how weve made the wrong turn
1569076 i will admit the author is quite creative but he is also the antithesis of our american heritage
1569077 i have felt this way about you for so long but i could never tell you you make me feel something no one else can whenever i think of you it gives me a feeling i can only describe as love whenever talk to you i feel pure bliss although i may not express it whenever i read something you wrote i cant help but cry likewise whenever i look at a picture of you i cry you are the most beautiful girl ive ever met although i love you with all my heart im glad youre with a guy like adam he makes you so happy and i know this sounds cliche but when youre happy im happy all this message was meant to do was tell you how i feel about you it was not meant to cause drama feel free to reply
1569078 if this was on the road and we won and laredo loses thats big thats my main concern
1569079 i dont care where we are at i just want to win
1569080 you could see it in the approaches on both sides the approach was there it was just a matter of getting some timely hits and things falling for us they fell for us in the fifth inning
1569081 to come back and clear my name is important to me
1569082 theres not many jobs where you make this kind of money
1569083 he finishes every run within his individual drills i see the guy working hard to get better
1569084 i think the guy shows up each day and he has a purpose when he practices
1569085 thats always going to be in the back of some peoples minds can the guy make it
1569086 we know that when ricky williams gets on the field and suits up that hes going to give you 100 percent effort and you know that hes going to go to the wall for you
1569087 hes an unbelievable player but its just keeping him on the field its like one of those things you have to show me you have to go out and give me a full season i dont think anybodys worried about it but its just a matter of him going out and getting it done
1569088 i got a whole bag of tricks to stay focused
1569089 for myself and ricky the positive competition is always good
1569090 i just want to make sure i dont do anything to make it any worse
1569091 if this was on the road and we won and laredo loses thats big thats my main concern
1569092 i dont care where we are at i just want to win
1569093 you could see it in the approaches on both sides the approach was there it was just a matter of getting some timely hits and things falling for us they fell for us in the fifth inning
1569094 do you know anything about tanzania and how it got things mostly stabilized
1569095 this is the exact reason intelligent logical people in our country are pushing for english to recognized as the official national language of the united states
1569096 well our situation is a bit different and we need to honor the different cultures of those who immigrate here by not forcing them to speak the language of the majority
1569097 in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon the persons becoming in every facet an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all we have room for but one flag the american flag we have room for but one language here and that is the english language for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as americans of american nationality and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the american people
1569098 we want to make our children feel that the mere fact of being americans makes them better off this is not to blind us at all to our own shortcomings we ought steadily to try to correct them but we have absolutely no grounds to work on if we dont have a firm and ardent americanism at the bottom of everything
1569099 the media offers up a steady diet of data about current immigration from mexico and much of it consists of
1569100 just looking at averages can give you a very distorted view of whos learning english or dropping out of school or climbing out of poverty
1569101 there are certain jobs or certain services you just cant get as an illegal immigrant
1569102 there are plenty of indications here that for those mexican immigrants who are interested in making a more permanent attachment to the united states their legal status puts very severe barriers in that path
1569103 mexican immigrants tend to be segregated somewhat from the rest of us society some 42 of hispanics lived in predominantly hispanic neighborhoods in 1990 chiswick and miller 1999
1569104 english ability was nearly universal even among first generation immigrants
1569105 the authors begin by telling the story of anchor baby maria velazquez and her immigrant husband carlos saying
1569106 its important that they know where theyre from that theyre connected to their roots
1569107 well our situation is a bit different and we need to honor the different cultures of those who immigrate here by not forcing them to speak the language of the majority
1569108 a majority of people in those countries dont think of themselves as somalians or sierra leonians or even tanzanians but as members of the various tribes
1569109 when money has changed hands between the rightful owner and a willing buyer a theft has not been perpetrated
1569110 well if we have nukes why shouldnt kim jung ill
1569111 well our situation is a bit different and we need to honor the different cultures of those who immigrate here by not forcing them to speak the language of the majority
1569112 oh i meant even your african americans wont do those jobs
1569113 you have a photo of a woman with a sign saying
1569114 americans no longer can expect blacks to pick cotton and anyway machines do a better job now for what machines cant do they have illegal mexicans and others
1569115 i hope that i am able to temper holly and her sisters but i am not sure i am having much impact some day when it all comes crashing down around them maybe they will look back and think about the words i drummed into their heads
1569116 did the writers even see the movie they are making fun of
1569117 the competition this year was the best ive ever season
1569118 we won a couple tournaments but when we got to that next level we saw what was at that level we saw the best and learned how we need to play thats only going to improve us
1569119 were going to have everybody back and the girls know as a team what we have to do when we come back here next year
1569120 i think he will turn out to be a really really good player
1569121 i think the good news is that stew needed defensive linemen really badly
1569122 so i called stew and i said stew heres the deal
1569123 its running all together those things are enjoyable once you get there but its just so time consuming you dont have much time for football
1569124 ive got 100 hours as a pilot but i dont have a plane
1569125 that was 20 years ago when i got the 100 hours
1569126 but im not complaining its been great for our school its to the point you feel like youre an ambassador for the school thats important weve got a great story to tell so many special things have happened here
1569127 there were about 16 guys from the new york giants out there
1569128 thats a dead giveaway that we werent going to win it new york outvoted boone
1569129 in my mind if you had to pick a great football game you pick new england and the giants
1569130 but if you talk upset of the year there hadnt been but one weve got 63 scholarships michigans got 85 scholarships we were playing at their place with 109 000 people their budget is probably 200 billion dollars our is 2 you talk about an upset that was an upset
1569131 first of all i saw more little black dresses than ive ever seen in my life
1569132 for a guy from a little old town in east texas that was earth shattering
1569133 you had to dress california chic i took two suits a tux and went to buy another coat when i got there to be california chic i didnt know what that meant exactly what it really amounts to is that you dont button your shirt
1569134 we really dont know whats going to happen were trying to go over everything with a fine tooth comb its something about the rules and regulations with the ncaa
1569135 we have discussed the situation with dwight and have given north carolina permission to speak with him
1569136 however at this time he is enrolled at valdosta state and is practicing with our football team we plan on continuing under these pretenses
1569137 there is an opening for them to try to get a waiver from the ncaa rules based on the mitigating circumstances of the case
1569138 the ncaa doesnt want to put the kid between a rock and a hard place if there was misapplication the ncaa could give him the benefit of the doubt thats why the waiver process is there
1569139 ik ben een kritisch lid van het internationaal olympisch comit ioc mijn argument is niet alleen de traditie maar ook de zeer hoge kosten
1569140 de realiteit is dat dit mooie symbool van de hoop doelwit van protest is geworden door de enorme mediabelangstelling is de tocht hier ideaal voor door het herstellen van de oude traditie voorkom je tevens dat dit olympische symbool kapot gaat
1569141 sport gaat altijd boven politiek dat wil niet zeggen dat ik de wereld zwart wit zie de olympische gedachte is er een van verbroedering en daarvoor is nodig dat atleten uit alle landen zonder problemen naar de spelen kunnen reizen
1569142 the government is larger now and it acts as an anchor
1569143 during the great depression the government had neither the means nor the capability to serve as a backstop
1569144 i think well see a miserable job market and consequently an eroded standard of living for the vast majority of americans for several years
1569145 this is indistinguishable from a recession for a working family
1569146 theyre losing jobs and theyre getting a double bite as wage growth slows down and inflation kicks up people are losing out on both ends
1569147 you read the headlines and you look around and you think the world is coming to an end
1569148 but i dont think so if youre going to tell a worst case scenario story at this point its only going to be because the fed loses control
1569149 the fed isnt the whole story but its a big part of it
1569150 it allowed these absolutely insane bubbles to happen the lesson is you cant let these bubbles continue unabated with no policymaking
1569151 they thought it was just a great thing that the stock market kept going higher and higher
1569152 then of course wall street just ran wild it was some mix of irresponsibility and downright greed theyre all sort of on the hook but greenspan sits front and center
1569153 if its 2005 you cant look at a 40 year run of data and say it must be a law of nature that housing prices never fall
1569154 the punches havent stopped long enough for him to catch his breath
1569155 if the punches would stop even for a second the economy could catch its breath and pick itself up
1569156 this happened in english in norwegian in japanese and serbian
1569157 now when the book is released in hard copy the sales are spectacular
1569158 i think your language for your blog is totally different from your language in the guardian right so we have to adapt ourselves i have a lot of fun doing this
1569159 my god my wife is sleeping how can i share this news with anybody
1569160 but thats the whole point of creating cinema and making movies we at pnc are here to take chances hence were launching a new series called guerrilla flicks not gorilla flicks
1569161 a genre of cinema that dares to see tomorrow therell be comedies action whatever they will be non star non profit films the only qualification to make a guerrilla flick for pnc would be to have vision and derring do
1569162 im shocked to see the so called big filmmakers today only talk about money everyones talking mammoth budgets and ridiculous targets they dont talk about cinema my guerrilla flicks would be about small budgets small stars and big cinema
1569163 arindam mitra is shooting the first film in the series weve finalised 10 films already were lining up some of the most unconventional talents these include some of the biggest ad makers of the country all they need to do is direct the film that they believe in for pnc then theyre free to go wherever they want to go
1569164 every director big or small has this secret wish to make that one movie he always wanted to maybe david dhawan wanted to remake vittorio de sica bicycle thieves hes welcome to make it for us anyone and everyone are welcome
1569165 but the pro bowlers have been these older guys the more youre around and the more comfortable you get youre not thinking anymore youre just reacting the best you can and i think thats what those guys do the older they get the wiser theyve gotten
1569166 they understand when to use their bodies when not to use their bodies when to use techniques at different times they understand the guys theyre going against these young guys that are coming in theyre just pound pound pound pound pound
1569167 i realized if i was going to stay in the league i had to make that transition
1569168 and honestly when i started i was awful at it because i hadnt done it
1569169 you try to surround yourself with guys that are your kind of guys the kind of guys that you think represent the organization well
1569170 i feel every year i go out here im going to win this job
1569171 i feel im a smart player if not the youngest player i feel my smarts make up for a lot of it its not always the most talented guy thats the best player i try to use that to my advantage
1569172 this is the biggest offensive line ive ever been behind weve still got a lot of work to do weve still got a long way to go but i think the anticipation of getting back to moving the ball vertically up the field thats exciting
1569173 i just like to go out and do my job and do the best i can do and deal with it at the end
1569174 im getting a little more comfortable with the attention but still im on the shy side
1569175 josh from day one has always just been yes sir no sir coach jim grobe said
1569176 thats about all he ever says when its time to do something its yes sir when he makes a mistake and you correct him its yes sir he just has never been an excuse guy hes always been a hard work guy
1569177 every day he comes into the weight room or comes to practice you get his very best and i think josh for his age is so mature because he really understands that the only thing that matters is his performance
1569178 shes pretty laid back she doesnt say a lot but she talks when needed
1569179 we have actually designed a few plays in our offense to have both of us in the game at the same time two lethal weapons at the same time
1569180 im actually rooting for and hoping that he can pull out rookie of the year as well that would be nice not only would it be the third consecutive person from wake forest but it would be the second in our running backs room
1569181 as long as the average and percentage of yards is pretty high and were winning im happy
1569182 neither one of those kids are afraid to run between the tackles but theyve got real good foot speed to get on the perimeter so weve got to be just creative as coaches in the way that we get them the football
1569183 and that may be some unique ways other than just handing them the football we may be pitching them the ball we run orbits and they can do that stuff because theyve got such good foot speed but theyre also both really good at catching the football
1569184 to me it has kind of been a two horse race the whole time between wake forest and villanova
1569185 there was also marquette and providence and pitt was around forever indiana has been around florida and texas have watched him
1569186 if he was going to go away he was going to go to wake forest if he was going to stay home it was going to be villanova but he had all the city schools after him he could have made a phone call any day to any of those schools and said i want to come do you want to announce it
1569187 his biggest asset is sometimes his biggest detriment in that hes just so competitive
1569188 you draw a fine line between trying to curb that a little bit because you dont want to take that away from a kid
1569189 hes so competitive where he plays himself into exhaustion sometimes
1569190 he can guard up to four positions for us at the high school level depending on how big the other teams power forwards are
1569191 hes improving every day his shooting hes actually a good shooter now i expect him to be a really good shooter by the time hes ready to graduate from high school hes gotten better every year shooting the ball
1569192 i know the amount of time and emphasis we put in it
1569193 we love to recruit thats the name of our game
1569194 ive always loved recruiting here the coaching here is excellent for football
1569195 im excited about these opportunities to take a world class institution and recruit to
1569196 nascar made a statement last week that there is no way that the cup cars would run on rain tires under any set of circumstances
1569197 i enjoyed watching it a lot like everyone did but you want to put on a quality show and im not sure our cars were at speed in montreal and easy enough to drive to really put on a quality show
1569198 i spoke to clint bowyer and carl edwards and those guys and they said they had an absolute blast but i dont think they put on a show for the fans
1569199 if youre spending money to come sit in the grandstands and watch a race you want to see a competitive race and not a rain race where you have guys just tiptoeing around
1569200 its just been hard work weve been working extremely hard since january february when we realized we were off on the 11 2 miles
1569201 we feel were doing the right things but the tracks weve been at recently are pretty unique tracks we wont see in the chase
1569202 so while im very proud about where were at id still like to be a little nervous and concerned and thinking our team does a better job hungry and not sitting back and feeling like were there
1569203 but once you re rack the points essentially to zero for the final 10 races everybody is on top of one another and youve got guys like jeff burton and matt kenseth in it or close to it
1569204 i see matt as a championship contender each year i see jeff gordon as a championship contender each year
1569205 at the beginning of this year we went 20 some races without a win and i found it odd i was being criticized for not winning
1569206 i look at some of the good performances jeff has had i look at tony and imagine how frustrating it must be for him you look at charlotte coming down to the final laps
1569207 as i continue on in my career im sure theres going to be a point where i go through that nobody is immune to it it happens to different people at different times
1569208 you just never know when youre going to stop winning
1569209 experience is great you can just take it to the next level if youve been there before and you know what the pressures are going to be even down to the racetracks and how they are going to evolve through a race if they take rubber
1569210 it doesnt mean it cant be done as a rookie it doesnt mean somebody in the chase for the first time cant win it or somebody with less experience cant win it
1569211 but from my own experience even starting back to the championships i lost in the off road ranks like one by two points back in 97 that experience taught me and helped me to be stronger today and deal with the pressures and championship battles
1569212 at the start of the year everyone is pretty easygoing when you get to this part of the season silly season is starting contracts are up people need points to get into the chase people need points to be in the top 35 there are just a lot of things going on
1569213 what were trying to do is prevent people who walk in with no agenda but while hes inside with a gun gets irate and may do something drastic
1569214 we have a castle doctrine that says wherever your castle is house car and you have a threat on your personal space you have the opportunity in this state to defend yourself
1569215 the ipod could not be restored an unknown error occured 6
1569216 we know that you know it aint right but youll just suck it up until we decide otherwise
1569217 this murder by israelis is meant to oppress us and break us and cause us to relinquish our struggle but we no longer have anything left to lose
1569218 despite the soldiers and officers behavior who want to signal to the residents to halt their protest we will not accept this a man who had land that was taken away in order to build the fence what does he have left to fear or to lose the fire and the violence will not deter us from continuing to struggle for our rights
1569219 we rule that this route cannot remain as is and we determine what will and will not be in the new route
1569220 has been largely successful due to the support of both israelis and internationals
1569221 hoy en hiroshima de nuevo me comprometo a que nuestro pa s mantenga firmemente los tres principios antinucleares y que lidere la sociedad internacional a favor de la abolici n de las armas nucleares para sostener la paz
1569222 conscientemente a la mayor a para la que la m xima prioridad es la supervivencia humana
1569223 we can only hope that the president of the united states elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority for whom the top priority is human survival
1569224 the voices faces and forms that vanished in the hell
1569225 this study should teach us the grave import of the truth born of tragedy and suffering that the only role for nuclear weapons is to be abolished
1569226 children who evacuated buildings or went to work at factories on that day have not returned 63 years on the atomic bomb deprived them of normal life
1569227 the success of our maiden issue is very encouraging we did not foresee that the issue will be oversubscribed by day two prompting us to offer p2 billion more
1569228 the lack of publication of respondent meralcos amended application for the increase of its generation charge is thus fatal by this omission the consumers were deprived of the right to file their comments thereon
1569229 the court disagrees with the investigating justice on this point to constitute gross ignorance of the law the acts complained of must not only be contrary to existing law and jurisprudence but were motivated by bad faith fraud dishonesty and corruption it was not shown that judge panday was thus motivated when he ordered the dismissal of criminal case no 94 5506 upon the filing by the public and private prosecutors of a motion to withdraw and or dismiss which was based on the affidavit of desistance executed by the alleged victim and her parents
1569230 the court of appeals has already forwarded all the documents to the court sc and the three man panel has already been given copies and they will be holding their organizational meeting later wednesday perhaps to plan on how their investigation will proceed
1569231 generally cases are raffled if its not raffled to you you dont have any business trying to be interested or get a particular case
1569232 like any other oral arguments being held in the supreme court
1569233 this was our worst effort i wouldnt say effort this is our worst performance
1569234 i dont think we were as sharp as we have been i dont think we played very well or not up to what we can play
1569235 we are not happy at all with the way we played i think we could have done much better
1569236 we are going to play much better defense i think you have to give some credit to the australian team because they executed very well
1569237 we broke down on defense and let the other team get open looks
1569238 we cant have mental breakdowns like those because these teams are tough and really know how to shoot the ball
1569239 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first games where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1569240 weve won four games here and now its a matter of winning eight games in a row
1569241 depreciation keeps declining under wdv while there is a uniform charge under slm
1569242 unless the nature of the industry is changing or there are new assets which depreciate on a slower basis companies need not change the methodology if the business continues to be the same and the company changes the calculation method to understate profits it is fine but if it is done to overstate certainly not good
1569243 according to the securities and exchange board of india norms if there is any change in a method of accounting and if there is a material effect on the results following the change companies must give reasons for it and quantify the effect that such a change will have
1569244 ultimately if the change is done for reasons other than the assets or business itself changing then there is only one reason why companies show a lower depreciation to overstate profits
1569245 i checked for the correlation between earnings and the possible channels of earnings management for all tata group companies for the last 15 years about 1 500 observations there is strong correlation between earnings and 1 other income 2 extraordinary income and 3 miscellaneous expenses hence a partial conclusion can be made that when companies in tata group do not perform well then their performance is boosted by other means
1569246 the share of dal has increased during the quarter with dal receivables increasing by rs 1450 crore quarter on quarter during 1qfy09 sales to dal were rs 1 560 crore which is marginally higher than the increase in receivables from dal
1569247 the company has not recognised rs 399 crore of translation losses on fccbs since the fccbs can potentially get converted although the fccbs are out of money
1569248 this is only a one quarter effect investors need not worry if companies are making whole and true disclosure of the facts more than the results investors should look forward to views from the management on how the company is shaping up rather than the current quarter performance
1569249 if you do it only once there will be no meaningful change in the subsequent quarters but not repeatedly

1569259 most of those outages were at stations that had a big weekend and then sold so much monday morning before their regular deliveries showed up
1569260 but it says i was the one worth leaving how can that mean anything else
1569261 my friend said and i do now and all this lamenting for all these months seems over now and in recognition of that fact so solid and real in my mind im not looking back

1569271 the beatings will continue until morale improves or the budget is passed
1569272 i think weve always had success in that aspect because we emphasize that you get what you ask for the secret
1569273 its an honor and i know it comes with a lot of responsibility but i wouldnt want to have it any other way

1569287 god this is garbage but i have to post it anyway
1569288 lignus just as death must follow life life must follow death
1569289 ah the great black deer i paid a pretty penny to a merchant from underoot to snag that
1569290 what no didnt you read the sign leos leather we dont do just shoes but if youre looking for something to put on your feet i can help you out actually ive been working on a new design that you might just like come on
1569291 ah yes it is but its a high heel sandal oh the girls around town have been begging me for ages to come up with something that has heels on it and so i finally did what do you think sure to be all the rage around everywhere town
1569292 its a very pretty shoe i just need something a little more rugged the boy looked like he was holding back a sneer
1569293 i plan on doing a lot of walking is all
1569294 i was just planning on doing a little bit of traveling before i settled down anywhere
1569295 id like a backpack if it isnt too much trouble
1569296 if youre traveling thisll be the one for you take a look inside you see that compartments you can keep your clothes in this big one here and anything else youll be taking with you should fit here that big old book of yours could slide into this compartment and over here on the side is a special compartment specifically for food
1569297 hunters like this kind of real handy if youre going to be on the road for a spell
1569298 i told ya last night i would give you a discount didnt i
1569299 when i go buy a loaf of bread from bernice im going to tell her to shove her high prices
1569300 trevor mentioned something about how some of the merchants used lignus as an excuse to overcharge
1569301 it just means you need to avoid the bakery the florist the grocer the grain peddler the
1569302 well if youre leaving so soon you probably dont have much say in the matter
1569303 yup and dont let them scare ya neither i dont think they do it because they like scaring people so much as they like their image theyre the tough kids in town and they want to make sure the label sticks i guess just hold your ground if you let them intimidate you theyll just keep on keepin on
1569304 thats right oh and you might want to see ms stitch first theyre likely to go at least a little bit easier on you if youre wearing clothes that fit
1569305 a while back we had some merchants come in from the west and one of them was selling crystal spider silk
1569306 is it good its only the finest fabric in journeys end
1569307 you can change into it just behind there if you like
1569308 now dont take this the wrong way but i dont suppose you could be convinced to leave town a bit
1569309 yes you can you just make sure you tell every girl you see giving you that jealous look where you got that dress from and well call it even alright
1569310 we have to get this stuff salted and cured so todays the last day you can buy fresh
1569311 youre one of those that shows up from the someone else room and leaves almost immediately thats why you have a bag like that isnt it a traveling bag youre not planning on enjoying our little town very long are you
1569312 and how do you know im new how do you know i havent come down here from port town
1569313 ive spent more than a few nights in port town i know a port towner when i see one and you aint it
1569314 lignus is nothin all the valley merchants like to complain about her but shes a softie and if i were you i wouldnt be getting these ideas about how great you are over it
1569315 cuz theres real horrors here in journeys end and you arent ready for them
1569316 really sounds like a nice place to visit kind of like a retirement home
1569317 see you dont know nothin listen to us were hunters we know theres things in the golden woods thatll give you nightmares for the rest of your life if youre lucky enough to get out of there with your life
1569318 razor back badger got it i was sleeping where i shouldnt have been sleeping when i shouldnt have been sleeping not a pleasant way to wake up i can tell you
1569319 that was the same badger actually oh and this one here too that was a very bad morning
1569320 and this over here this was from a whistler i was delirious for three days after these patches on my neck are from the giant red spitting frog and this scar on my knee
1569321 my point is that there is a lot of scary stuff in the golden woods
1569322 on our third day out on party chunga looks at me and says lets go do a little explorin
1569323 we burned a day heading up to the northeast and we walked long into the night
1569324 i point it out to chunga and let me tell you he looked like someone poured flour or somethin over him
1569325 the creeps real dont you mock it in fact if i was you id stay out of the golden woods completely cuz if the creep comes and it catches you youre done
1569326 stay out of the golden woods unless you have to go in if you have to go in you enter by the path you stay on the path and you leave by the path
1569327 its obviously something you wouldnt normally want to be seen in right
1569328 he came out of the someone else room as a farmer but he ended up hating it with a passion
1569329 youre telling me i got backed up a week because i took him on i really dont see how bill puts up with him
1569330 so how was your morning i see you spent the money like i told you to
1569331 that i did so what did you get you know aside from an old beat up dress
1569332 oh there is but nowhere near where were talking the only reported sightings of the creep are up here and up here
1569333 im thinking a ship that can take us across the roaring sea
1569334 maybe i have but thats not the point trevor clenched his jaw
1569335 look okay so maybe outside this town i dont have that much experience on you but still
1569336 no listen to me i thought this out and its not just about you either
1569337 but why i mean if you wanted to go abroad why not just go abroad
1569338 dunno maybe because i was scared a little i really dont understand it all that well all i really know is that if i were to leave this town i would need an excuse to do it

1569378 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor and sign onto the american energy act our all of the above plan to increase conservation innovation and american energy production instead of doing the speakers bidding by voting against bringing it to a vote if you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one youre siding with the speaker of the drill nothing congress and radical special interests that favor higher gas prices at the expense of energy strapped american families
1569379 this cynical strategy is disgustingly dishonest without any real solutions to help americans who are struggling with record high gas prices it appears the democratic leadership has hit on a new plan deceive deceive the press deceive its members and deceive the american people democratic members have a pass from their leaders to talk about drilling at home while the liberal democratic leadership which is beholden to special interests that want higher gas prices plays rope a dope back in washington ensuring there is no vote to help the american people before november its cynical dishonest and wrong and it wont work

1569457 we are really excited about bringing the 80th all star game to the great baseball city of st louis
1569458 we had a wonderful time in new york this year and i can think of no national league city that could follow what we did in yankee stadium other than st louis
1569459 the cardinals are very proud to host the 80th all star game
1569460 its an opportunity for us to showcase our new ballpark which fortunately has already been home to our 10th world championship and were very excited to have a signature event like the all star game here
1569461 commissioner selig is committed to showcasing the new ballparks and showcasing the cities that have gone to the effort of building a new ballpark
1569462 and theres no better new ballpark than busch stadium i think that had a lot to do with the award
1569463 ive been reading bout it but our all star game will dominate the entire downtown for four days we like st louis we like downtown we like the accommodations everything will be just fine
1569464 but there is also something to having an all star game in a city like pittsburgh or a city like st louis or a city like detroit or a city like milwaukee where it takes up the entire downtown new york went on with the business of being new york st louis wont go on with the business of being st louis it will be the all star game
1569465 other than playing in october theres nothing more spectacular than an all star game
1569466 you have the best baseball players in the world on the same field you get a chance to watch them on the workout day and then the game itself i think its great to watch if youre a fan and if you happen to be on the field its even more of a thrill to see the guys interact im sure that next year here in st louis the guys are going to have a very special experience

1569478 i did not create an atmosphere in my public and personal life that is consistent with the important mission of the office of attorney general
1569479 i am heartbroken by my failure to recognize the problems being created and by my failure to stop them
1569480 there are questions that go all the way to the top of that office about how the leader of that office allowed this environment to persist
1569481 i told him that he and other officeholders as well as the members of the legislature should continue to expect that we will continue to provide high quality legal services to all of them
1569482 we will distance ourselves both figuratively and literally from the attorney general until he makes the decision that is best for people of ohio and that is to step down from the office
1569483 that would mean he would no longer be welcome at those events
1569484 i would hope the attorney general would understand that his effectiveness as attorney general has been so greatly diminished that in my judgment at least he cannot appropriately continue to fulfill the duties of that office
1569485 this was not the failings of the party i think the party responded strongly and forcefully and has taking steps to clean our own house
1569486 my suggestions gonna be is if he and hell know whats going on with his particular situation is this the time to cut the strings and be done with it
1569487 im going to ask him to make that decision about his political career is it time to step down

1569613 the post mortems of 700 koalas earlier this year showed koalas are now starving to death due to loss of food and the disease rates are going up
1569614 it would be a great tragedy if we stood by and let the koalas of southeast queensland be wiped out
1569615 we face total loss of koalas within 20 years we need to take on issues that in the past we have felt were too tough on residents frankly weve been too cautious and its time to take tougher action doing nothing is not an option

1569644 to say that she had been taken into custody only on july 17 2008 is a blatant lie
1569645 the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth

1569649 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions

1569664 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1569665 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending

1569696 what ive discovered in my research is and the department of veterans affairs has now acknowledged it there is a correlation between trauma suffered by vets and subsequent behavioural issues from their kids
1569697 they see their parents flipping out and losing it they see breakdown in marriages they somehow take an assumed guilt position and start to feel vulnerable about the whole issue
1569698 i believe this has impacted on this young lady and i think its probably indicative of what may happen to other veterans kids too
1569699 her dad was an icon in the 60s who was dethroned because he went to vietnam he paid the penalty for it
1569700 he has since become a high profile spokesperson for vietnam vets and she lives with that day to day

1569711 we know we cant guarantee that every single peanut particle will be out of the area its certainly going to be a much reduced risk
1569712 people who dont think peanut allergy is a real allergy all they gotta do is take someone like my grandson to the hospital when hes blue and cant breathe
1569713 grandsons and grandfathers need to yell together cry together have a good time
1569714 i now have the opportunity to take my grandson to the ball game
1569715 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1569716 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1569717 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes
1569718 the fbi had asked everybody to sign these nondisclosure things
1569719 i think im the only person at usamriid who didnt get polygraphed
1569720 one person said hed sit at his desk and weep
1569721 he said 60 so i bought the laptop from him for 60
1569722 i kind of roughly pieced it together i figured he was the guy who was the victim
1569723 he seemed like such a nice guy when i talked to him he was not mean or fidgety or anything he had like no emotion to him but he didnt seem like he was a very nasty guy he just seemed calm and normal
1569724 when the construction is complete travel on the highway will be safer and more reliable for tourists residents and truckers
1569725 and there will be fewer traffic tie ups on this crucial national commercial transportation artery
1569726 upgrading the trans canada highway from coast to coast is one of our highest priorities
1569727 and todays announcement is an important step forward in that plan
1569728 fencing of the new sections when theyre complete and the overpass and underpass structures for wildlife will improve mobility of the animals from one side of the valley to the other
1569729 please dear almighty up above dont smite me for questioning your methods and management skills but i do feel that the whole reproductive system could use a little tweaking here and there
1569730 that man left feces in his house on his couch on his towels
1569731 i have spent the last nine months trying to keep him alive and im not going to give in to that im not
1569732 its been hard because of the other incident not being able to save money to move somewhere else so its hard
1569733 we may not agree with the logic employed for moving this waste but in the interest of a positive relationship with our host community weve decided to move this to temple
1569734 but in my 20 years in this business ive never seen
1569735 the biggest thing for us was that waste management was not keeping us informed i think theyre going a long ways toward repairing that relationship
1569736 they are efforts that dont in any way address the bigger issues and were afraid perhaps at some level that these initial efforts could kind of create a smoke screen around the bigger issues

1569739 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1569740 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1569741 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1569742 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1569743 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1569744 its pretty much done as far as the storm is concerned
1569745 its not very heavy but its steady falling so i really hope we get enough
1569746 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
1569747 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
1569748 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1569749 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1569750 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1569751 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
1569752 she didnt give us any indication that she planned to flee
1569753 school districts are unique in a way in addition to inflation and population growth we dont really have the option of curtailing services we have academic standards going up and additional mandates to meet
1569754 its not like theres a special gas pump for part time workers
1569755 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1569756 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

1569767 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1569768 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1569769 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1569770 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1569771 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1569772 i can assure you i intend to get to the bottom of it
1569773 its a secret account that was withheld from the co op membership
1569774 its unbelievable its outrageous this is off the books accounting
1569775 we continue to make inquiries about the account and are awaiting answers as to its purpose the source of the funds and the management of the account
1569776 such activity is certainly out of the bounds of acceptable business practices
1569777 the texland partnership with pedernales to build a coal fired power plant should have ended in 1987 with the settlement of the lawsuit with lcra
1569778 if there is an active account in texlands name it should be closed and the money should be distributed to the parties involved in the settlement
1569779 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1569780 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1569781 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1569782 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1569783 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1569784 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1569785 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1569786 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
1569787 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1569788 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1569789 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1569790 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1569791 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1569792 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1569793 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1569794 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1569795 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1569796 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1569797 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1569798 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1569799 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1569800 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1569801 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1569802 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1569803 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1569804 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1569805 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1569806 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1569807 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1569808 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1569809 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1569810 how much for your women how much for the little girl
1569811 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1569812 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1569813 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1569814 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1569815 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1569816 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1569817 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1569818 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1569819 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1569820 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

1569823 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1569824 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
1569825 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

1569830 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1569831 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1569832 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1569833 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

1569837 well we dont want to completely separate out the children but we do give more money to the provider for poor children than for the rest who may not need it the reason we pay for everyones food is that we want to be able to supervise what the children are eating
1569838 in boston where supreme court justice stephen breyer once sat in a modest federal courthouse there is now a glittering 218 million palace designed by i m pei we looked for the best architect in the world breyer boasted he did not come cheap peis original bid was 8 million but as the project unrolled he raised his price to 13 million all taxpayer paid pei even spent 80 000 federal cash on a wooden model of the building the completed courthouse is the judiciarys taj mahal more resplendent than the simple greco roman home of the supreme court itself yet surprisingly ugly centered around a lavish six story atrium and graced with the finest marbles granites and paneled woods the building features thirty three private kitchens thirty seven libraries sixty three private bathrooms almost 1 million in art and even a private dock on boston harbor but the cost of the building was less than half the actual tab the site is way out of the way virtually inaccessible to mainstream boston it the site was rejected for transportation and litigation reasons said a report by the boston redevelopment authority but that was only a small problem for the fat federal purse ones thats much fuller than those of its citizens washington merely appropriated an additional 278 million for an extention of the boston transit system so it could reach the courthouse that sounds like a large tab but at last count the cost of the underground railway has reached 601 million

1569869 was more concerned about the people around him than himself
1569870 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1569871 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1569872 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1569873 watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house
1569874 as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbors drive it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1569875 it was going to be hayden penn i dont think there was much of a secret there
1569876 the guy has gotten snakebit somewhat with the variety of things that have happened i think everybody is very much aware of his history the recommendation came from our player development people and our minor league pitching coordinator that waters was the guy hes getting a big opportunity tonight and i look forward to watching him pitch
1569877 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice
1569878 he was throwing 93 mph but effectiveness has got to be a part of it
1569879 theres no other plan what am i supposed to do go out there and walk everybody the team needs to win
1569880 im going to have to have elbow surgery at some point
1569881 its just a matter of what dr yocum says whatever he says goes
1569882 if i feel like a four letter word i cant help the team win
1569883 we have plenty of capable guys in the bullpen who can
1569884 the only thing we have to do is win the series tomorrow you dont want to wait until thursday splitting the series still means something but you want to kick them while theyre down and get a sweep
1569885 being left handed i try to model myself like guys like him i was a little bit nervous because it was the yankees i never faced a team of that caliber before i was nervous at first ive been watching the yankees since i was little to get out there and pitch against them was exciting
1569886 i felt like i had to prove the rangers didnt make a mistake by leaving me up here i got a lead attacked hitters and stayed aggressive
1569887 thats the best ive seen him throw since he got up here
1569888 as the game went on he got a little swagger going he commanded all his pitches it was a huge game for his confidence
1569889 we got the monkey off our back with the indians
1569890 weird as that sounds theyve got a scrappy team so we will take this one and run
1569891 when do you ever see a guy hit a home run foul and then hit an actual home run
1569892 the offense came through big hopefully its a sign of things to come
1569893 you kind of know what makes you win and what makes you lose and what makes us win is our pitching and our defense and then we have timely hitting tonight we got the hits when we needed it
1569894 it just didnt want to work the way i was seeing it in my minds eye
1569895 but it rarely does so we just had to make the adjustments on the fly and our guys did a great job
1569896 a lot of want to we wanted to win that game somehow we did because these guys have really pressed us hard so i was really pleased with the effort of our players tonight
1569897 every win is huge and we need it over the course of the season
1569898 in our minds to get to 90 something wins you got to win now as much as you can every day
1569899 but then you get to embrace moments like this which is the best part about it

1569905 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1569906 our goal is firm and it is that the korean peninsula must be denuclearised if we work with patience and consistency verification can be done perfectly and i believe north korea should cooperate on this

1569953 the dss wireless connection isnt just a substitute for the link cable that was used on the game boy
1569954 although this wont be available at launch were thinking of using the wireless download function to change the way in which people try out upcoming games at retail outlets
1569955 were thinking of a system where people can download a demo program with a time or a usage limit to their own ds we hope that this system will allow new potential hits to be recognized by everyone and that it will help to buck the trend where only sequels are hitting the sales charts

1569959 b anks need to review their loans with the aim of giving these people something they can afford
1569960 there are going to be a lot of clients who wont qualify for a home loan and it will have more impact on the lower end of the market who buy in the r400000 to r600000 bracket
1569961 entry level buyers already find it difficult to get a loan because of the national credit act and more people are getting thrown out of the system this year
1569962 the silver lining is that they can wait until the market improves to sell at a better price
1569963 the property market has become out of reach for many people as they are qualifying for less than they did a year ago because of the high interest rates and the rising cost of living
1569964 and as far as i know no local clients have been affected yet

1569974 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1569975 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1569976 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves

1569978 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1569979 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1569980 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1569981 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1569982 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1569983 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1569984 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1569985 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1569986 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1569987 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1569988 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1569989 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1569990 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked
