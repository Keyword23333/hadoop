4900001 but there has clearly been a deterioration in people s perception of their financial situation over the past two years
4900002 having the convenience of mobile phone banking or internet banking to keep up to date with their finances can take away any unnecessary stress allowing them to sit back and enjoy a well earned holiday
4900003 shoppers seem to want either a treat or a cheap deal
4900004 at a time when the cost of living is rising this is bad news for families and will cause further fuel poverty
4900005 this is not just a case of a small purchase this is thousands of pounds for a house that we are talking about
4900006 however opting for capped tariffs is more than taking a bet on the direction of energy prices it is knowing for certain how much your outgoings will be for the term of the deal
4900007 just imagine how tough things are for pensioners living on a fixed income
4900008 a sharp decrease has been seen in the store people put on saving and if this decline continues there will be trouble ahead if consumers do not put money aside
4900009 it is a very real problem for households that require two incomes to stay afloat especially in today s economic climate
4900010 when you re taking out insurance and you re looking at contents it s important to make sure you ve got sufficient cover for everything and that you do include everything
4900011 short city breaks were quite cheap before but now with the cost of fuel and therefore flying being higher these breaks are not as attractive as they previously seemed

4900019 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4900020 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4900021 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4900065 when youve got people who believe in talking snakes raining frogs and a man living in a whale youve hit the comedy jackpot
4900066 we had a number of situations similar to that this is just a topic that gets people going
4900067 in that sense it was a dirty trick otherwise nobody would have talked to me
4900068 the working title was a spiritual journey we didnt tell anybody especially in america that i was in the movie
4900069 larry and the crew would arrange interviews set up the lights and camera warm up the subject with a pre interview once it was all lit and they were ready id come in
4900070 look im not trying to mandate that people think anything in particular im just suggesting theres a different way to think thats just free speech but when it comes to religion free speech has been off limits for many years
4900071 now the bush administration has done all it could to make religion a part of government you cant let that happen you could say that george w bush allowed this movie to be made
4900072 if anything is clear about our beginnings as a country its that the founding fathers wanted to separate religion from government some were christians but most were deists they used generic terms like the creator and they never mention jesus christ in any of their founding documents
4900073 everybody we talked to was reasonable theyre normally functioning people
4900074 but if youre religious it means you believe in some crazy stuff
4900075 is to disrupt habitual responses and rather than affirming pre existing practices create new ways of engaging the world

4900077 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4900078 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages
4900079 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available

4900081 intention to smoke during a future pregnancy was significantly tied to the intention to consume alcohol

4900092 architecture over the past 100 years has divorced itself quite significantly from the building process
4900093 thats allowed architects to do many more things than theyve done before
4900094 but its limited their ability to be part of the build process
4900095 and they forget about gravity when theyre in school they just draw these crazy things
4900096 along the highway in that stretch of desert somewhere between west texas and east new mexico there was nothing and nothing and nothing and then the thunder lodge but what a nothing there the horizon had a weight she hadnt known a horizon could have a plain unvaried by cactus or tree unstirred by lizard or coyote undimpled by even a shadow only here and there the slightest swell of hills
4900097 here they were a mistranslated family a foreigners half heard version close to the real thing but not quite and like a family blind to the dangers around them to the scorching uninhabited weight of the world
4900098 a perfect simulacrum of the thunder lodge laid out the same way in reverse
4900099 i knew of brian friel and i knew that mark robbins was directing it
4900100 put those things together and it worked for me so i decided to audition
4900101 he was one of the first people i read for the role who i thought could do it
4900102 everyone i saw audition had to go up against max in my mind because my image of the role was someone of his capabilities physical vocal and sort of larger than lifeness
4900103 she put together some materials dealing with life in northern ireland at the time and some history on the strife between britain and ireland and that was very helpful
4900104 and of course i watched a couple of films to try to get help with the dialect a bit
4900105 it was a very nice film beautifully done with fine acting
4900106 he leaves you asking a lot of questions and you dont necessarily know what he meant when he wrote a given line or even the end of a play
4900107 in this one theres a lot of stuff up in the air when we sign out
4900108 but thats sort of our mission as well to use actors of the city
4900109 and anytime we can eschew type we like to do that i hadnt seen max work in a while and he was genuinely and obviously excited about the prospect of doing this play
4900110 if something comes along that interests me sure ill probably go audition for it

4900343 khadijah juga mengamati gambaran fisik muhammad cara ia berjalan menunjukkan rasa percaya diri yang tinggi posturnya seimbang tidak terlalupendek dan tidak terlalu tinggi tidak terlalu gemuk dan tidak pula terlalu kurus
4900344 muhammad memiliki kening yang lebar dagu yang lepas dan leher yang jenjang dadanya bidang matanya indah dan lebar dengan bola mata yang hitam pekat giginya yang putih cemerlang
4900345 agak mengherankan bahwa khadijah memperhatikan semua itu ketampanan dan kegagahan muhammad memang mampu memikat banyak orang tetapi bukankah khadijah memanggilnya untuk urusan bisnis tampaknya khadijah tertarik dengan pribadi pemuda ini alangkah lembutnya keindahan yang terpancar dari wajah muhammad alangkah indahnya senyum tipis yang menghias wajahnya
4900346 akan tetapi khadijah juga sempat ragu pantaskan ia menikah dengan muhammad
4900347 khadijah adalah wanita yang kaya cantik dan berstatus sosial tinggi ia masih memiliki pesona bagi banyak laki laki di sisi lain muhammad bukanlah lelaki yang rakus dan gampang tergoda oleh hal hal yang bersifat lahiriah
4900348 wahai anak pamanku aku berhasrat untuk menikah denganmu atas dasar kekerabatan kedudukanmu yang mulia akhlakmu yang baik integritas moralmu dan kejujuran perkatanmu

4900403 if you do look at the methodology even the way polls are done right now i think its a little bit archaic in the sense that normal people do not have phones in other words landlines
4900404 they have cellular phones so those people of course tend to be more working class individuals and tend to be more democratic to generalize younger people do not generally have landlines im just speaking in broad generalizations
4900405 among all adults 9 6 percent had only a mobile phone in the first half of 2006 compared with 7 7 percent in the preceding six months the overall number without landlines 13 2 percent includes those who have no phone at all
4900406 they have cellular phones so those people of course tend to be more working class individuals and tend to be more democratic

4900420 resistance dominated an underpopulated ps3 launch environment and became the consoles defining shooting experience moving over two million copies worldwide in the process that the game is now an established brand selling to an extant ps3 installed base should make it greatly exceed its predecessor sales wise and some unmatched on console anyway multiplayer features including 60 player versus play and eight player co op differentiate it from everything else in the sector it has direct competition in the form of gears of war 2 but these two exclusives co existed in 2006 and theyll do so again now pity for everyone else that tries to hang with them though

4900423 i made a few easy mistakes but he played really really solid
4900424 you would probably have to put him as a darkhorse hes someone to watch
4900425 we played periods of good footy weve got some players who arent in great form at the moment which makes it hard

4900430 he played on the norm smith medallist and then went to the possible 2008 brownlow medallist so it was a reasonably tough evening for the fella
4900431 i just hope we can get on top of it soon because if we continue to lose games we are a chance of not making the finals at all
4900432 theres been major speculation about our senior coach and its started to get beyond a joke in recent times
4900433 i went on the record earlier this year to say that terry wallace would coach the richmond football club for his full term
4900434 i said it when greg miller was sacked i dont know how many other times ive got to say it
4900435 richmond has not interviewed any other coaches no one from the board has approached any other coaches from any other clubs and nor do we intend to approach any other people from any other clubs this year
4900436 terry wallace will coach the richmond football club next year unless he tells me something different
4900437 theres been speculation from a few media people that richmonds in crisis that were an instable club
4900438 weve had one termination in the last five years at the richmond football club that was greg miller in the last couple of weeks only one
4900439 our chief executive has been with the club for nearly five years now the last richmond coach to be sacked was 12 years ago
4900440 but the media seems to think that every time something goes on at richmond we sack a coach our last two coaches danny frawley and wallace will have served at least five years
4900441 there have been no other major richmond departures the only board change in the last four years was greg miller stepping off the board earlier this year i dont see where the perception of instability is coming from
4900442 weve improved immeasurably as a club this year were on the cusp of making the finals
4900443 but we know where were at big losses to geelong and adelaide in the last couple of weeks have shown that were not at the top end of the scale
4900444 weve got a lot of work to do as a football club and we will continue to do that and well continue to bring top quality people that will ensure the richmond football club gets back to the top of the ladder

4900468 theres been speculation from a few media people that richmonds in crisis that were an instable club
4900469 weve had one termination in the last five years at the richmond football club that was greg miller in the last couple of weeks only one
4900470 our chief executive has been with the club for nearly five years now the last richmond coach to be sacked was 12 years ago
4900471 but the media seems to think that every time something goes on at richmond we sack a coach our last two coaches danny frawley and wallace will have served at least five years
4900472 there have been no other major richmond departures the only board change in the last four years was greg miller stepping off the board earlier this year i dont see where the perception of instability is coming from
4900473 weve improved immeasurably as a club this year were on the cusp of making the finals
4900474 but we know where were at big losses to geelong and adelaide in the last couple of weeks have shown that were not at the top end of the scale
4900475 oh the employer must be looking for someone specific poor me
4900476 if he continues to stick to his position and does not resign it will create a situation leaving the government with no option but to ask the army chief to intervene and help resolve the political crisis
4900477 gen kayani will be asked to intervene if the president does not show flexibility
4900478 the coalition partners are also ready to let musharraf go to a country of his choice at least for the time being
4900479 the president is confident that they will not let him down to face a humiliating ouster at the hands of the political parties
4900480 the recent spate of news reports and rumours being spread that president pervez musharraf is resigning are totally baseless and malicious
4900481 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4900482 firms like ibm are using eye tracking technology to help redesign messages
4900483 ibm says that since starting to use heatmapping in email tests early last year it has made some simple changes in email design that have led to major improvements in responses from customers
4900484 cisco which did a round of email newsletter eyetools testing last week says it has found a way to increase the odds of consumers reading more of an email
4900485 when i got to meet up with candice michelle i told her that raw needed her now more than ever and she replied
4900486 ok in this instant we dont care how long people looked at things we just want to know what they saw
4900487 66 percent of people saw this pixel color it yellow on the plot
4900488 no one has ever risen to the top without those qualities and no other service builds those qualities like the marines thats why the marines make it to the top in greater numbers than any other service the marine corps is quite small compared to the other services only 8 out of every 100 servicemen women are marines the other 92 are in the army navy or the airforce as you can see we are outnumbered not just a little but a lot even so there are more former marines in congress than any other service of the 500 top businesses fortune 500 in the country 175 are run by former marines thats 35 out of every 100 force to which has turned out a disproportionate share of this countrys leading citizens how can such a small organization produce a large share of business government and community leaders s top service and when a marine leaves the corps he she carries with them those qualities which makes the corps truly unique were saying the marines are the number one service but how do you know that well just consider the following facts and statements that people not affiliated with the marines have made about us we the marines the smallest service have had more books written about us than any other military organization in history the state department chose the marines not the army navy or the air force to guard the embassies throughout the world staff sergeant mark jander a soldier and former paratrooper in the as an almost magical fighting force
4900489 how can i make it with an elite group like that

4900491 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
4900492 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
4900493 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass

4900513 incentives require engineered standards to be fair and to keep productivity increasing if they are not continually evaluated chances are that youll end up paying an incentive for production that you have gained over time
4900514 managing labor is a game of reducing a few pennies here and there on an organized basis to reduce the cost per order overall at the same time we need to take into account how we can motivate and increase productivity fairly to achieve our companys goals

4900517 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

4900528 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4900529 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages
4900530 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4900531 theres some pretty grubby and horrible things that happen out there in remote workplaces where farmers have used foreign labour
4900532 if we dont regulate this scheme the illegal practices will continue
4900533 a worker should not earn one dollar less than an australian worker there should be appropriate levels of pastoral care and community involvement in deciding where these workers will be placed
4900534 im not overly comfortable about foreign labour coming into our workplaces but theres an undeniable labour shortage
4900535 im worried about these industries collapsing under the pressure of that labour shortage

4900549 a red wine drinks better at a little cooler temperature
4900550 well thats fine if you dont live in zimbabwe room temperature varies depending on where you are and the heat in someones home
4900551 a lot of people think they dont like red wines or that they are harsh but what theyve done is its at room temperature and its causing the sensation of burning in the throat
4900552 one of the mistakes a lot of people do is they try to get wine too cold
4900553 you dont want them to be icy cold because it shuts down the flavor its almost like drinking ice water because its ice cold and you dont taste any of the wonderful nuances
4900554 i think anytime you introduce your hot little hands around the bowl of the glass you are increasing the temperature of the wine and from aesthetics you are also adding fingerprints and we dont want that

4900582 we have a good idea of what we would like and we are confident we can do some business before the start of the season
4900583 when luke became aware of villas offer he expressed the wish to move on
4900584 i dont want to have to fight to get players to want to play for this club
4900585 in any case this was a fantastic deal for the club for a player of his age
4900586 at the moment he is with us and we have no formal offer from anybody
4900587 there is interest here and there but nothing concrete i may let one or two go on loan because they need to play it is part of education

4900590 3 kita perlu bertanya pada diri sendiri apakah kita faham dengan apa yang allah sampaikan melalui rasulnya kalau dalam bab akidahpun ramai yang termasuk di dalam golongan 72 dari 73 iaitu 1 73 apatah lagi dalam bab bab yang lain dari akidah sebenarnya tiada pemisahan antara ekomoni dan akidah semuanya ada di dalam islam tetapi kerana muslim telah mesub kontrak kebanyakan penimbaan ilmu sains kepada bukan islam timbullah pengasingan antara bab bab agama dan sains begitu juga boleh dikatakan kebanyakan teori yang dilaksanakan dalam kehidupan adalah dirumus oleh bukan muslim walaupun pada mulanya ada yang berdasarkan pemikiran islam
4900591 6 ilmu sains adalah alat untuk menghasilkan bukti ia tidak dapat dan tidak boleh menjadi asas membenih kepercayaan atau iman keperluan beriman atau percaya perlu pada asas dan permulaan tetapi sekiranya ia tidak disambung dengan penggunaan alat ilmu sains kepercayaan tersebut akan terus hanya berdasarkan kepercayaan tanpa pembuktian itu asas kepincangan umat muslim hari ini terlalu dihantui dengan ugutan kehidupan akhirat sehingga mati kekuatan pemikiran lupakah kita bahawa hanya dengan pemberian akal kita layak bergelar manusia hanya dengan pemberian ilmu yang bergantung pada akal manusia dilantik menjadi khalifah di bumi allah ini dan beragama itu islam tidak lain hanya kerana berakal jadi kenapa pendekatannya selalu menolak penggunaan akal untuk mempermudah penyampaian sehingga semuanya tergelincir dari jalan yang lurus
4900592 2 kesemua idea idea yang diberikan adalah ilham dari allah yang pada saya telah melalui penapisan dalam bentuk pengalaman yang saya lalui sehingga ke umur asar ini saya pernah jelaskan di aan segala yang saya tuliskan di aan akan dipertanggung jawabkan kepada saya sehinggalah terpaksa menjawabnya di mahkamah di akhirat kelak tidak timbul isu idea bernas atau tidak kerana konsep yang saya paparkan ialah konsep isi dan kulit allah telah menjadikan manusia berbeza dari mahluk yang lain dengan adanya akal dan logik maaf kalau sdr termasuk di dalam golongan yang alergik kepada logik
4900593 7 komen saya di blog sdr mukhtar berhubung salaffossoleh persoalan yang perlu disampaikan kepada muslim sekarang bukan sahaja perlu berkisar kepada kebanggaan menjadi muslim atau mengambil kalangan ahli masyarakat yang hidup di zaman salafi sebagai idola tetapi perlu menjangkau lebih sedikit kepada isu isu semasa zaman salafi dan zaman ini kalau salafi zaman nabi boleh menyediakan tapak penakhlukan dunia ketika itu dengan senjata tercanggihnya ialah pedang dan kuda kita jangan terbawa semangat berpedang dan berkuda mengikut apa yang dikatakan sebagai sunnah nabi saw keadaan semasa itu adalah pedang dan kuda menjadikan salafi idola sebagai contoh perlu kepada melihat yang tersirat bukan yang tersurat yang tersurat ialah pedang dan kuda yang tersirat ialah kemenangan muslim mengatasi kekuatan kafir sekarang ini kalau muslim mahu mengidolakan salafi jangan di atas dasar mengenepikan ilmu sains dan teknologi
4900594 2 saya mengambil ayat dari aq yang mengatakan alam ini terbentuk di dalam enam ayyam yang saya ringkaskan di dalam bhg 6 teori darwin fi sittah penceramah di video menerangkan pada molecular level iaitu tahap 3 dan 4 dalam ringkasan saya bhg 6 semua yang ada di alam ini terdiri dari atom yang sentiasa bergerak dynamic equilibrium saya kira ini tidak dapat disangkal lagi bagi mereka yang mempelajari alam melalui displin sains keseluruhan blog saya adalah bertujuan untuk menserasikan pembuktian ilmu sains kepada adanya nas nas yang berkaitan dengan aqidah kita tentang kehidupan saya pasti dengan minda yang terbuka luas penserasian dapat diperolehi ilmu sians ialah ilmu yang mengkaji carakerja allah kitab aq tidak memperincikan penerangan tentang proses pembentukan alam bagaimanapun kitab aq mengarahkan kita merujuk ke kitab alam untuk mencari jawapan
4900595 1 pencarian manusia kepada tuhan bermula dari baliq setelah allah swt mengajarkan nama2 sebagai simbolik kenaikan pangkat kepada khalifah perlu juga diingat mulanya islam budaya hidup juga pada saat yang sama bukan bermakna yang sebelum itu tidak islam seluruh alam bertasbih kepadanya tetapi dengan bermulanya kewarasan akal mahluk allah dipertanggung jawabkan dengan pilihan yang dibuat perkembangan pengunaan akal terus meningkat dari saat itu berinteraksi dengan alam dengan petunjuk sedar atau tidak dari allah swt

4900692 now the bush administration has done all it could to make religion a part of government you cant let that happen you could say that george w bush allowed this movie to be made

4900696 im yahweh now allah has stepped out for some coffee and jehovah is in the back room trying to get away with snagging a ham sandwich cant smite on an empty stomach afterall i am what i am now

4900745 organizing or central or unifying or whatever theory of biology
4900746 parents could opt out of those classes but their child is still held responsible for learning the curriculum
4900747 t hey need to do so with the understanding that their child could still be tested over that material
4900748 as a theory broadly accepted in the scientific community as an organizing theory of biology
4900749 we believe that a complete education includes understanding the basics of what this theory is about even if one disagrees with it

4900753 what john gave stu was the ability to laugh at himself and have humor because he was such a serious student and what stuart gave john was a kind of he was inspirational john had no faith in his abilities to do anything serious or complete anything and stuart was constantly supporting him
4900754 ive always turned around and ill always defend his corner because what you have is a situation where someone has said many years ago the same as ive been stigmatized over the years someone turned around and said stu wasnt a good bass player and its lived with him ever since hes no longer here to defend his corner so i will there were better bass players and there were worse bass players ok but what stu gave on stage was that he played with 200 percent and he played with his heart and he played with his feelings
4900755 what i remember most about the concert was that we were so far away from the audience and screaming had become the thing to do everybody screamed if you look at the footage you can see how we reacted to the place it was very big and very strange
4900756 at shea stadium i saw the top of the mountain

4900758 you know pacing was probably never a problem for the beatles because first of all all those songs were just terrific they were playing for a half an hour so i mean if you listen to an old beatle tape of a concert its 30 minutes of twist and shout and i saw her standing there and ticket to ride
4900759 linda was also there but as she was a real music fan she was quite annoyed with everyone screaming i think she enjoyed the experience but she genuinely wanted to hear the show that wasnt the deal though not then

4900889 i was part of that inquiry process and in the course of that inquiry process it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies

4900891 p erhaps one should not talk or write too much about the wild world it may be that it embarrasses other animals to have attention called to them
4900892 what we havent had is a deep exploration of problems here at home that are threatening the very vibrancy of the nation including the dismal employment picture there are many more americans out of work than the official statistics show the terrible toll that the housing and mortgage crisis is taking on families from one coast to the other the tens of millions of americans who are without health insurance coverage the stunning high school dropout numbers and a demoralizing problem with violent crime in several parts of the country
4900893 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4900894 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4900895 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4900896 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4900897 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4900898 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4900899 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4900903 momentum focuses on how the new connected age can increase the ability of people to make social change happen in their communities quickly positively and in a sustainable way
4900904 from proprietary to participatory traditional activist organizations tend to work in silos and in isolation from sister organizations these proprietary organizations keep information they consider vital to their surivival like strategic plans and membership lists tightly sealed they falsely believe that this information equals power proprietary behavior is amplified in an environement marked by intense and increasing pressure to raise funds from donors

4900910 martin kearns of green media toolshed proposes that a corps of activists be trained in an array of skils and technologies institutions would then be able to call on these corps members who could be instantly available fully trained and read for various campaigns around the country and eventually around the world
4900911 activists also need to measure their online stickiness issue crawler web based software created by govcom org foundation that is headquartered in amsterdam tracks and maps links between websites these maps graphically represent the network of organizations interested in a specific issue or topic the size of a website or node on the map reprsents the number of links between that site and the other network members larger nodes indicate more links

4900914 use technology to create a new kind of public commons
4900915 a smaller but growing segment of the population has been working to use this connective power for civic purposes because it is one of the few if not the only mediums in the world that allows 200 million people to take action and be active rather than reactive like television and media says joe trippi former campaign manager for the howard dean presidential campaign he compares the advent of the internet to the invention of the printing press as one of the most significant events in american history especially as a tool for increasing civic participation and engagement indeed the internet has begun to help change everything from journalism through blogging that challenges the media to go beyond the headlines to education through open source sites such as wikipedia and others and may now have the potential to change democracy especially institutions that have increasingly provided little incentive or opportunities for citizens to participate recently for example hundreds of philanthropists nonprofits charities technology companies and others gathered to discuss the civic potential of using web 2 0 technology a collection of user oriented technologies such as self publishing organized by daniel ben horin executive director of compumentor a nonprofit intermediary the conference included groups from the kiwanis club and the american cancer society to amnesty international and blogher organization in fact developed a set of web based tools that organizations and communities can use to self organize hoping that these could harness the same kind of energy that has been mobilized for wikipedia to fight aids or hunger or homelessness
4900916 when you have the ability even as a single individual to see a problem like an oil spill on a lake and can tell thousands of people about it instantly you can mobilize more people faster and more effectively as a result the role of organizations shifts from agenda setting leaders to supporters or diffusers of information and resources across wider networks trippi fine and others believe that the next challenge for those interested in civic engagement is developing ways to use these tools in ways that help people engage for the common good rather than polarizing purposes or issues which has turned off many americans from traditional politics and political institutions starting from the larger notion of common good will lead to more participation from the onset and will build trust among diverse groups of people which in turn can lay a foundation from ore productive discussions when disagreements about issues do arise ultimately technology holds the promise of turning the entire power structure on its head empowering grassroots citizens who previously felt voiceless it is important however to underscore that technology should not be seen as the silver bullet from civic engagement but rather an important tool in it technology gets in the way sometimes of really moving toward our larger goal of participation says howard rheingold author of smart mobs so you cant start there you have to start by asking people what interests you what do you care about what issues get you interested and then help them explore ways to use technology to turn those ideas or desires into action it is still too early to tell whether this rapidly changing medium will be a net benefit for civic engagement especially whether people can address entrenched social problems by associating online in particular there is a relative lack of online work that focuses on local geographic communities even though many real world problems are local it also remains to be seen whether people can develop civic identities online rather than become active citizens through their families churches schools and neighborhoods and then use computers as tools as deepak bhargava executive director of the center for community changes notes technology has been enormously useful in improving the transparency of many of our public institutions and can be an effective tool in distributing information and making connections among people but it shouldnt ever take the place of face to face contact which is equally important in strengthening the civic and political life of communities
4900917 a world of two metabolisms the overarching design framework we exist within has two essential elements mass the earth and energy the sun nothing goes in or out of the planetary system except for heat and the occasional meterorite otherwise for our practical purposes the system is closed and its basic elements are valuable and finite whatever is naturally here is all we have whatever humans make does not go away if our systems contaminate earths biological mass and continue to throw away technical materials such as metals or render them useless we will indeed live in a world of limits where production and consumption are restrained and the earth will literally become a grave if humans are truly going to prosper we will learn to imitate natures highly effective cradle to cradle system of nutrient flow and metabolism in which the very concept of waste does not exist to eliminate the concept of waste means to design things products packaging and systems from the very beginning that waste does not exist it means that valuable nutrients contained in the materials shape and determine the design form follows evolution not just function we think this is a more robust prospect than the current way of making things
4900918 we at church believe in the separation of church and state but not the separation of faith and politics faith is defined as world view and all of us have a world view
4900919 now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see

4900924 but it was really the blocking by my teammates that allowed me to make the plays
4900925 our defense has dominated our offense for a lot of camp
4900926 it was a little surprising to see that happen but maybe its a good thing when davin came to our camp i fell in love with him ive learned my lesson when i see a fast athlete who is also a good student i take them because god only made so many of them
4900927 the depth chart hasnt changed since the beginning of camp

4900980 leroy gave voice to a topic that we are very uncomfortable with death and dying
4900981 my cancer had a face and a heart and a smile
4900982 he looked to be about 5 which meant he was probably 10 malnutrition will do that
4900983 he was lying on his back and had thrown his arm up over his head his fingers had gotten tangled in my boot laces as i looked in his eyes i saw the light go out and he died a strangers face my face was the last thing he saw and all i could do was shake my foot to free my laces from his fingers and then move on to catch up to my team it was five years before i could tell that story
4900984 while his craft was to illustrate television stories with the right picture his gift was using words to touch people

4900986 a daily reminder that none of us walks this road alone what could be better than that

4901082 i ran with some toughness ive had to stay patient through the whole process and im still trying to make all the effort over the last year pay off
4901083 my aim was to come out and win when i saw the time im celebrating im happy
4901084 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4901085 i didnt come here to run the world record because i was the world record holder
4901086 hes been running very well since he was very young
4901087 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4901088 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4901089 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4901090 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4901091 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4901092 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4901093 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4901094 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4901095 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages
4901096 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4901097 theres some pretty grubby and horrible things that happen out there in remote workplaces where farmers have used foreign labour
4901098 if we dont regulate this scheme the illegal practices will continue
4901099 a worker should not earn one dollar less than an australian worker there should be appropriate levels of pastoral care and community involvement in deciding where these workers will be placed
4901100 im not overly comfortable about foreign labour coming into our workplaces but theres an undeniable labour shortage
4901101 im worried about these industries collapsing under the pressure of that labour shortage
4901102 even with the increasing summer retreats of sea ice which many polar scientists say probably are being driven in part by global warming caused by humans there will always be enough ice in certain parts of the arctic to require icebreakers
4901103 which scientists say probably are being driven in part by global warming caused by humans
4901104 there will always be enough ice in certain parts of the arctic during some parts of the year
4901105 the increasing summer retreats of sea ice probably are being driven in part by global warming caused by humans

4901107 the russian troops are certainly not in any hurry to leave the country
4901108 from early indications it appears the actions of the officers were justifiable and unavoidable
4901109 until that investigation has been allowed to proceed i think it would be premature for anyone to be speculating about the causes or any of the outcomes
4901110 our police are out there doing a very tough job and theyre often in a very dangerous situation
4901111 equally citizens are entitled to expect reasonable behaviour from our police so lets wait and see before we jump to any conclusions
4901112 i want mothers to listen to their instincts and thats not something i did
4901113 child care in the u s is not typically regarded as a societal responsibility
4901114 parents are out there on their own pressured to make a good decision about selecting child care but they often dont know where to access good information or what to look for
4901115 in regulated care licensed or certified we have individuals investigating complaints
4901116 in an unregulated setting no one really has jurisdiction if someone complains that their child is not being cared for properly
4901117 if we had asked to see where the children slept we would have noticed that there were no baby monitors in the room and that would have been a huge red flag
4901118 she did what she had to do to support her family i understood that
4901119 all of us parents knew what she was doing and if we had a problem with it we didnt have to stay
4901120 that was my biggest mistake i didnt trust my instincts we decided to give kaltenberg a second chance
4901121 ms kaltenberg has sentenced me to a life without my daughter a life i dont want to live and which isnt worth living

4901134 i have been fortunate enough to follow the progress of this album over the last few months of its production and as the final mixes of each track arrived i could only be increasingly impressed as the canadian outfit brought it all together burstyn the overall impression was of a band of experienced musicians with a love of progressive music but intentionally or not having a 21st century sound nearer to evanescence than within temptation this is no heavy rock album more melodic rock with a classical and dramatical impression with dark corners and the odd ethnic approach great guitar and keyboards make it a prog rock essential mh
4901135 its a big day for china but we want to do more
4901136 we were playing at home and we just cannot lose this game
4901137 we win this game tonight because of our defense and the way yao played inside
4901138 its bigger than in 2004 because its really difficult having the home court and everything that comes with it
4901139 of course the pressure is always there in big games we feel the pressure but most of the time we handled it pretty well
4901140 i think this team comes with more experience after all of our training games and a very frustrating game against spain
4901141 i think we all learn how to trust each other play together and win this game as a team
4901142 sometimes it seems like we are down like at halftime and in the fourth quarter but we know what to do

4901198 cada vez que vas a exportar precursores qu micos hay que ir a sedronar y llenar los papeles donde se se ala qu se va a exportar y qui n lo va a recibir del otro lado entonces el sedronar autoriza nicamente a aquellas empresas que utilizan precursores qu micos para temas en particular

4901209 they have found ways to win in games that on paper they probably shouldnt have
4901210 they are capable of coming up here and doing that again if we are not careful
4901211 right now they are playing as well as anybody in the league
4901212 no matter what the score is no matter the deal is this team amarillo will not quit and they will not give up this will be a dog fight
4901213 they put more pressure on the ball then they do on the qb
4901214 coach mackeown has done an outstanding job of evaluating their personnel and evaluating their strengths and adapting his game plan to that they have an all af2 performer in their secondary in db aaron williams hes a tremendous player they play man coverage and try to knock down balls and make the big play they are an aggressive defense
4901215 the thing that jumps out right away about their receivers is that they catch everything
4901216 if it is anywhere in the vicinity of their receivers theyre going to catch it which is why its so important that we get good coverage this week
4901217 when you get to this point in the tournament these teams are here for a reason

4901226 it has been a couple of years and i thought the pitch played really well tonight
4901227 i was very pleased with the way that we did in the first twenty minutes of the game
4901228 we were getting goals on set plays and moved the ball quickly
4901229 i was excited with the way that cbu came back in the second half
4901230 i was really pleased with them both parker and thomas really showed that they belonged tonight it was what we expected when we recruited them so it was really nice to see them live up to expectations out there tonight they both have bright futures ahead of them

4901234 mrs britton came to ireland to study a two year masters programme in medieval studies at nui galway in 2006 and was not told before she came here or on her arrival that a condition of her permission to stay was that her son must not attend a state school
4901235 the first time mrs britton heard of this condition was when she tried to renew her permission to stay at a point when her son was already attending primary school and when she is more than halfway through her masters programme
4901236 she has found the rules have changed without notice and that the government is telling her that in order to stay in ireland to finish her course which is costing her 12 000 a year in fees plus loans to cover her living expenses she must take her child out of the school where he is happily settled and enrol him in a private school
4901237 we believe mrs britton has a right to expect her permission to stay in ireland would be renewed on the same terms as it was initially granted in 2006 with no conditions relating to her sons education
4901238 it is ironic that the day before the uns international migrants day we are in court seeking leave for a judicial review of a decision which we firmly believe breaches the irish constitution the european convention on human rights and the united nations convention on the rights of the child
4901239 the ici has consistently lobbied the government to spell out in law what migrants rights to family life are and this case demonstrates that need
4901240 we would urge the government to apply the same rules in ireland as apply in the uk where a child of an international student is permitted to receive a state education while a parent is studying there provided the child leaves the country when the parent completes their studies
4901241 the child of a student may therefore receive state education while his parent is studying here but he would be expected to leave with his parent on completion of the parents studies

4901281 there were a lot of opportunities for us before gardy comes up with the big hit i dont know how to explain it other than to say sometimes it looks easy but just a fraction of a second off and its an out
4901282 when i first came up against fulchino in the 13th i was just looking for a good pitch to get wood on the ball and then after fouling them both off im suddenly 0 2 then after getting the count back to 3 2 i knew fulchino would want to come in with a fastball rather than risking walking me and having to pitch to johnny damon and thats what i got
4901283 that was something we tried friday night and it didnt work
4901284 johnny just wasnt comfortable doing it and thats the way it is
4901285 its a good thing we were playing at home so we had the last at bat
4901286 he went first to third and had to run hard a couple of times obviously youre curious to see how he feels sunday to see how he recovered he did hit a home run and it was no windblown homer
4901287 yesterday is a big day well take him back as soon as we can get him so much of it depends on how he feels

4901548 he can pause a game plan and work against hitters he pumps strikes and makes it easier for guys behind him its impressive to watch
4901549 he throws strikes hes got great stuff and its tough to get into a rhythm on him because hes creating his own rhythm for himself we didnt get anything going
4901550 he threw a lot of strikes got deep into the game

4901565 just after the death of flowers and before they are buried in snow there comes a festival season when nature is all aglow

4901568 i told jason to play cowbell for a year and he did it
4901569 for reasons i cannot explain theres some part of me wants to see graceland
4901570 in real world terms isnt it the case that they are under united states authority
4901571 in passing upon constitutional questions the court has regard to substance and not to mere matters of form
4901572 in custody under or by color of the authority of the united states
4901573 in real world terms isnt it the case that they are under united states authority
4901574 in passing upon constitutional questions the court has regard to substance and not to mere matters of form
4901575 incorporate accessible elements from the pop song form and allude to what people expect to hear in a bar or club
4901576 i was used to playing here with fight the big bull so i was expecting a huge sound
4901577 with a smaller band though you can really hear each individual part so each part is really important now im wearing two hats one being the composer and the other as the improviser i get to relax a lot more in fight the big bull because its not as much my baby
4901578 really is about space vertically it manifests itself in melody and harmony and horizontally it manifests itself as rhythm which is generally the part with which im more interested
4901579 if a listener can appreciate the beauty of silence or of one long sustained note they can appreciate any permutation of it because everything is built from that concerning accessibility ultimately theres nothing to figure out
4901580 like a composer tonight especially he knew exactly what each piece needed and gave it
4901581 cameron has an incredible sense of when to take flight with you he forces you to commit to what youre doing trey on the other hand has the ability to synthesize all the elements of the tune and improvise in the spirit of the way i write
4901582 i try not to be too goal oriented for the distant future hopefully after the summer well get into the studio depending on peoples individual schedules
4901583 its been a dream for me and adrian duke to arrange the music of this monumental beatles album and let alone perform it at a wonderful large concert venue
4901584 plus we are very honored to share the stage with the legendary bio ritmo and on the rise group the mills family band
4901585 it just kind of felt like home it was more natural than straight ahead music free jazz was very modern everything else was a throw back
4901586 i always knew music was what i wanted to do it felt more like home than anything
4901587 i hate to use chord symbols and am far less concerned with vertical relationships than with linear ones i think we have only one tune in which the guitar has more than one or two notes at a time i also love huge beats especially mixed metered highly syncopated ones so you might hear a lot of those
4901588 have identified a single nation that treats i c j judgments as binding in domestic courts
4901589 the presidents authority to act as with the exercise of any governmental power must stem either from an act of congress or from the constitution itself
4901590 the language cited was from a 1952 ruling in which the high court found that president harry s truman did not have the authority to have the federal government seize and run steel mills
4901591 it was a heinous murder of two young girls who were only 14 and 16
4901592 its certainly time the case be resolved and the sentence be carried out
4901593 texass duty in this respect is all the greater since it was texas that by failing to provide consular notice in accordance with the vienna convention ensnared the united states in the current controversy
4901594 erects legalistic hurdles that can threaten the application of provisions in many existing commercial and other treaties and make it more difficult to negotiate new ones
4901595 in over 200 years of our nations history im not aware of any other directive from the president directly to the state courts and state judges
4901596 this brutal murderer had already received all the process he is due
4901597 it is high time that justice was carried out in this case
4901598 you cant trust politicians it doesnt matter who makes a political speech its all lies and it applies to any rock star who wants to make a political speech as well
4901599 were trying to cultivate a party environment we want everyone to come out and have a good time hopefully people in the neighborhood will see whats going on and want to get involved
4901600 i dont have time can the other witness make a statement
4901601 we cant protect you and your family and if you try to protect yourself or your loved ones we will arrest you
4901602 yes one has convictions for fraud and criminal damage the other for common assault mmmmm mmmmmm yes i see mmmmmmmmm
4901603 would it help if you told them that we are magistrates
4901604 gordon browns first anniversary as labour leader began with the party securing only 1 066 votes losing its 500 deposit and having its working majority in the house of commons cut to 65 as john howell the conservative candidate succeeded mr johnson in the oxfordshire seat
4901605 it is better to spend it on studio time rather than packaging no matter how cheap the packaging is
4901606 im learning to like the mistakes thats the best part
4901607 so of course i followed up on that comment like crazy and he ended up setting these shows up
4901608 will be comprised of new tunes that both he and i wrote for this occasion
4901609 rhythmically the way he writes for horns is real tight one thing is the way he makes the vandermark 5 sound so big part of that is really embracing the power of one horn and what it can do and ive tried to do that its tempting to double everything or harmonize everything because you have five horns but one voice can be really powerful
4901610 like an old rich uncle the amount of biz questions i have asked is absurd sometimes i think he must get so sick of it
4901611 we all loved it here and decided to release it it fits perfectly well into the catalogue of current clean feed artist by their strong identity and unsuspected commitment to the music we are truly happy to release such a record by people we have never heard about before
4901612 defend himself and his family against hostile indian tribes and outlaws wolves and bears and grizzlies
4901613 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
4901614 so if you have a law that prohibits the possession of books its all right to ban newspapers
4901615 the kind of weapon that was common for the people to have i dont know that a lot of people have machine guns or armor piercing bullets
4901616 the children will get up and grab the firearm and use it for some purpose
4901617 when a fundamental right is at stake there is a role for judicial review
4901618 all the more reason to allow a homeowner to have a handgun
4901619 it took me three seconds to remove a trigger lock im not kidding
4901620 national government that sets a single standard for rural and urban areas for east and west north and south
4901621 the abandonment of every principle of strict construction federalism and judicial modesty in which the roberts court ever purported to believe
4901622 after all these years of deep conservative suspicion of turning over policy matters to the courts the roberts court has fallen in love with a new constitutional right
4901623 that when a fundamental right is at stake there is a role for judicial review
4901624 textualism should not be confused with so called strict constructionism a degraded form of textualism that brings the whole philosophy into disrepute i am not a strict constructionist and no one ought to be though better that i suppose than a nontextualist a text should not be construed strictly and it should not be construed leniently it should be constructed reasonably to contain all that it fairly means
4901625 dellinger reminds kennedy that he of all people would hate a national government that sets a single standard for rural and urban areas for east and west north and south and that the right to own guns causes disputes among experts such that the courts should hang back and allow the local legislatures to thrash it out
4901626 set a single standard for rural and urban areas for east and west north and south
4901627 when gura says that the court should be taking normative questions out of the hands of legislature
4901628 the transition to upside down world is complete this question is too complicated for anything but the policy judgments of the court its as if hes channeling the whole warren court at once
4901629 is where the heart of the latino bourgeoisie wants to be
4901630 is where the heart of the latino bourgeoisie wants to be
4901631 the people who live in this house are hispanics these are white these are old quakers these are mexicans here
4901632 did you think it was going to be run down because mexicans moved here
4901633 it was years before i knew what a bar was
4901634 we had some interesting people move into whittier in those days
4901635 there was quite an influx of the rockefellers in here for a while i bought nelson rockefellers car
4901636 were not going to have your kind of people in town
4901637 they were trying to control the influx into their little quaker town
4901638 they moved east from boyle heights then from boyle heights to montebello then from montebello to pico rivera
4901639 then people with incomes relatively speaking moved to whittier they came up whittier boulevard it was kind of an easy trip
4901640 you have to dress appropriately not with your shirt hanging out you cant wear jeans
4901641 i can relate to them just working hard to pay your monthly bills
4901642 when i was growing up they called monterey park the beverly hills of east l a
4901643 whittiers like santa barbara in a way its so peaceful and old
4901644 when we bought the house my wife and i would just lie in bed and say i cant believe it

4901647 tuesday nights we have dancing like the stars they did that because of the tv show
4901648 theres 10 things you have to know before you even swing at the ball
4901649 five years ago i didnt even know what golf was
4901650 and sometimes i like to look at it because it makes me laugh
4901651 were not trying to shut anybody out we should have a latino council member i think it just takes time for someone to step forward and do something
4901652 nobody cared about the fact i was a berkeley educated lawyer its still very parochial
4901653 we were so hoping to get them on some boards
4901654 we need that voice i just think we havent done that yet
4901655 the no match rule is an important tool for cracking down on illegal hiring practices while providing honest employers with the guidance they need
4901656 dhs does not believe that the direct costs incurred by employers would create a significant economic impact
4901657 its an attempt to justify the fundamentally flawed database without actually fixing any of the problems
4901658 it keeps the questions before the judge the same i would have been more concerned if they had come up with a big study
4901659 the best part about being there at that time was that it was a really vital time in the city of richmond the city was going through a renaissance period especially with the arts so there was a lot of work as a musician there and it was a great atmosphere and we had many great artists in residence coming in people who came in and spent several days or a week people like jackie byard the heath brothers elvin jones sonny rollins frank foster it was a great time to be there thats where i made a lot of my first new york contacts actually
4901660 but it wasnt the captain that sank the titanic a ship they claimed was unsinkable it was the iceberg
4901661 the best way to avoid disaster is to manage your way around the problem
4901662 cursed be that love and unity which cannot be preserved except at the peril of the word of god
4901663 when he was finance minister he gave away rm1 billion each to 15 crony companies without tenders and negotiations all under the skim kontraktor wibawa
4901664 come on then why am i here but i would like to know his secrets
4901665 anwar is the first leader among the malays and non malays to have criticised and opposed the nep
4901666 i only said i knew about the boxes i dont have it anwar ibrahim has it
4901667 pak lah kep to his commitment he did not interfere in the court process and anwar was finally freed
4901668 pak lah had even said he was a muslim and he had never been cruel to anyone what more to anwar and azizah
4901669 it is a potentially huge landmark decision maybe the only decision in our lifetime in which the supreme court will tell us what the original meaning of the constitution is without being impeded by precedents
4901670 preventing serious harm is not just a legitimate goal it is a governmental duty of the highest order
4901671 i want to be able to defend myself and my wife from violent criminals and the constitution says i have a right to do that by keeping a gun in my home
4901672 the police cant be everywhere and they cant protect everyone all the time
4901673 if you look at crime rates washington dcs crime rate skyrocketed after the ban was put in place
4901674 we believe its for the simple reason that law abiding people didnt have the means of defending themselves
4901675 even in britain i dont think people would want to put a sign on their door saying this is a gun free zone
4901676 if you could prove that gun laws are making us safer the remedy is to change the constitution
4901677 i thought this litigation was a terrible idea from the beginning and i speak as someone who thinks the constitution guarantees an individual right to own guns
4901678 gun rights were being protected pretty well already at least in line with what popular opinion thinks the second amendment does
4901679 the only thing that hurts our efforts is if its an extreme decision that says you cant have any limits any time anywhere
4901680 but anything short of that that basically allows reasonable restrictions i think could help the gun control movement
4901681 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4901682 there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4901683 its almost too close to see one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4901684 i will continue to struggle and work hard hopefully this is the start of many good things to come
4901685 im definitely pleased that if i couldnt do it she was the one
4901686 and im old enough to be able to handle it
4901687 i wouldnt have come back if i wasnt ready to come back
4901688 its what i do get out on the sidelines and get the boys fired up
4901689 i dont think we even expected this to turn out as it did
4901690 i was pretty calm until i got on the trampoline
4901691 theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing
4901692 i am a big girl but thats a lot of weight
4901693 a powerful state sponsored gymnastics program can get fake state issued passports to document the eligibility of its athletes who could have seen that coming

4901697 one of the girls marian fisher who died in pennsylvanias amish schoolhouse massacre asked the killer to shoot her first in an apparent bid to save younger girls
4901698 fishers 11 year old sister barbie appealed to roberts to shoot her next
4901699 barbie has been talking and she said marian said shoot me first
4901700 apparently what she was trying to do was to save the younger girls
4901701 it was very courageous of the girls to offer themselves
4901702 god was really present to give the girls that kind of courage
4901703 the more inventory you have the more likely you are to not have what you need
4901704 the regular h1 b visa quota of 65 000 was met two months after the uscis began to accept applications for fy 2007
4901705 lobbyists had helped convince congress to increase the number of annual h 1b visas to 115 000 in 1999 and then to 195 000 through fiscal year 2003 to fuel the internet boom
4901706 the george w bush administration however allowed that provision to lapse and the visa cap automatically reverted to the previous number of 65 000

4901709 its a neat way to interact with the animals so i think its a great thing
4901710 just because theyre in captivity doesnt mean theyre like your dog or cat theyve got their limits
4901711 its all about enrichment for the animals so we want to give the animals the most exciting and happiest life that we can possibly give them

4901717 for being a punk for girls these things dont satisfy
4901718 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4901719 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4901720 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4901721 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4901722 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4901723 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4901724 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4901725 how did i get so lucky how did life smile upon me like this

4901731 recognizes cgsc faculty for published writing contributions that enhance the mission of the college
4901732 the us army command and general staff college educates and develops leaders for full spectrum joint interagency and multinational operations acts as lead agent for the armys leader development program and advances the art and science of the profession of arms in support of army operational requirements
4901733 belief in god is a foundational factor once you do away with god as a given truth all other things are immediately affected by that for instance once god does not exist you suddenly have no reference to greatness outside of yourself and no revelation outside of yourself the greatest thing in life suddenly becomes something or someone else like yourself perhaps
4901734 strikes deep into the power of sin and renders it ineffective
4901735 only my goodnatured ness can help me contribute to the betterment of my unit or team when i realize that sin is an agent i can more quickly identify my own tendency to corrupt a group and bring havoc to what needs cohesion and team confidence my sin can also make my agenda more important than my units agenda and thus lead to unit failure
4901736 ive seen individuals from all economic levels and situations fail to get situated philosophically and religiously ending up wandering in institutions like our military just when you need that inner source of clarity and direction it fails to surface and when you could have made a difference for your team you fail
4901737 i was told because i cant put my personal beliefs aside and pray with troops i wouldnt make a good leader
4901738 look there is simply no other way to say it but to speak the absolute brutal truth here general petraeus has shockingly abrogated and noxiously defiled the sacred oath he took to protect and preserve support and defend not a parochial biblical worldview of the new testaments gospel of jesus christ but the united states constitution which includes a specific beacon provision which boldly proclaims absolutely no religious test in clause 3 article 6 by so very prominently and universally endorsing chaplain mccoys book with its unadulterated promotion of christian religious supremacy and concomitant excoriating and denigrating of the veracity integrity and character of the hundreds of thousands of united states military personnel who freely elect to follow no religious path petraeus unlawfully fashions his own de facto religion test in direct contravention of americas most cherished and beloved governing document amp 183 his command leadership role thus has become terminally freighted and compromised with this disgusting vile unconstitutional christian religious tyranny and exceptionalism at precisely the same time we are at war with islamic fundamentalists framing americas iraq and afghanistan combat efforts as a modern day crusade the monumentally detrimental national security risks attendant to petraeuss actions of constitutional defiance justify the swift forfeiture of his titular position of military command and further cry out for his immediate punishment by general courts martial under article 134
4901739 under the rubric of free speech and the twisted idea of the separation of church and state there has evolved more and more an anti christian bias in this country
4901740 being christian should bring goodness to our culture but the way it is being censored in our society you would think that to be a christian is to be a wicked torturous warmonger who wields religion over the heads and hearts of local governments to establish more wicked rules of right and wrong for everyone to obey without question where is this wickedness since when did christian become evil

4901774 you should know why johnny lingo paid eight cows for his wife
4901775 get johnny lingo to help you find what you want and let him do the bargaining
4901776 johnny lingo a boy seated nearby hooted the name and rocked with laughter
4901777 everybody tells me to get in touch with johnny lingo and then breaks up let me in on the joke
4901778 johnnys the brightest the strongest young man in the islands and for his age the richest
4901779 but if hes all you say what is there to laugh about
4901780 only one thing five months ago at fall festival johnny came to kiniwata and found himself a wife he paid her father eight cows
4901781 eight cows she must have beauty that takes your breath away
4901782 but the kindest could only call sarita plain sam karoo her father was afraid shed be left on his hands
4901783 but then he got eight cows for her isnt that extraordinary
4901784 i said it would be kindness to call her plain she was skinny she walked with her shoulders hunched and her head ducked she was scared of her own shadow
4901785 and thats why the villagers grin when they talk about johnny they get special satisfaction from the fact that the sharpest trader in the islands was bested by dull old sam karoo
4901786 they say theres nothing i might want they you cant help me get
4901787 always and forever when they speak of marriage settlements it will be remembered that johnny lingo paid eight cows for sarita
4901788 theres only one sarita perhaps she does not look the way they say she looked in kiniwata
4901789 she doesnt i heard she was homely they all make fun of you because you let yourself be cheated by sam karoo
4901790 what it must mean to a woman to know that her husband has settled on the lowest price for which she can be bought and then later when the women talk they boast of what their husbands paid for them one says four cows another maybe six how does she feel the woman who was sold for one or two
4901791 then you did this just to make your wife happy
4901792 i wanted sarita to be happy yes but i wanted more than that you say she is different this is true many things can change a woman things that happen inside things that happen outside but the thing that matters most is what she thinks about herself in kiniwata sarita believed she was worth nothing now she knows she is worth more than any other woman in the islands
4901793 i wanted to marry sarita i loved her and no other woman
4901794 oh you look fine you are a little weird maybe lol but you are still cute
4901795 well you are what you are and i can tell you were going for the

4901803 nimeni nu s a suit in cer afara de cel ce s a coborat din cer adica fiul omului care este in cer
4901804 dar daca isus era dumnezeu atunci unde a fost dumnezeu cand isus era pe pamant
4901805 nimeni n a vazut vreodata pe dumnezeu singurul lui fiul care este in sanul tatalui acela l a facut cunoscut
4901806 oricine crede in el isus nu este judecat dar cine nu crede a si fost judecat pentru ca n a crezut in numele singurului fiu al lui dumnezeu
4901807 si cuvantul s a facut trup si a locuit printre noi plin de har si de adevar si noi am privit slava lui o slava intocmai ca slava singurului nascut din tatal
4901808 daca vine cineva la voi si nu va aduce invatatura aceasta sa nu l primiti in casa si sa nu i ziceti
4901809 dar cine e ti ca s d m un r spuns celor ce ne au trimis ce zici tu despre tine nsu i

4901812 eu botez cu ap dar n mijlocul vostru st unul pe care voi nu l cunoa te i ioan 1 27 el este acela care vine dup mine i care este naintea mea eu nu sunt vrednic s i dezleg cureaua nc l mintelor lui
4901813 in mijlocul vostru sta unul pe care nu l cunosteti
4901814 el este acela despre care ziceam dupa mine vine un om care era inaintea mea caci este inainte de mine

4901816 nu ne va da el cu bunatate generozitate impreuna cu el isus toate celelalte lucruri
4901817 ma aflu sub presiune din partea acestor doua lucruri insa ceea ce eu doresc este eliberarea si sa fiu cu hristos caci aceasta fara doar si poate este cu mult mai bine
4901818 de aceea aceia in uniune cu hristos isus nu au nici o condamnare
4901819 fiindca dumnezeu a vrut ca deplina plinatate sa locuiasca in el
4901820 iar noi suntem in uniune cu cel adevarat prin fiul sau isus hristos
4901821 iar noi suntem in uniune cu cel adevarat in uniune cu fiul sau isus hristos

4901827 i mean we expected it to be much tougher but in a best two out of three set doubles match anything can happen and we know that maybe the classic doubles teams are into the semifinals of the olympic games and we have a great challenge coming up
4901828 i think the lead was important it was good to sleep well and start off in a positive mindset and continue what we have been doing
4901829 it has been a great tournament for us weve played well and we improved a lot during the last match they paes bhupathi were a very good doubles team but we played together and played incredible tennis

4901837 the recent conflict in georgia has raised some questions about how google maps has handled mapping in that part of the world the most obvious question is why doesnt google maps show any cities or roads for georgia or its neighbors armenia and azerbaijan the answer is we never launched coverage in those countries because we simply werent satisfied with the map data we had available were constantly searching for the best map data we can find and sometimes will delay launching coverage in a country if we think we can get more comprehensive data some of our customers have asked if we removed map data from any of these countries in response to the recent hostilities in that region and i can assure you that is not the case data for these countries were never on google maps in the first place but this has generated a lot of feedback that we are listening to and learning from were hearing from our users that they would rather see even very basic coverage of a country than see nothing at all that certainly makes sense and so we have started preparing data for the handful of countries that are still blank on google maps georgia armenia azerbaijan as well as other significant regions of the world will benefit from this effort

4901843 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4901844 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4901845 americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest

4901857 i was trying to achieve the impossible i guess the amount of running ive done coming in wasnt enough
4901858 cardiovascularly i felt comfortable but my legs had gone my calf went first then it went up the entire leg and it felt like i was running on one leg
4901859 but i didnt do all that work for nothing its just really frustrating
4901860 i was going to the finish line no matter what i did all the hard work and it feels frustrating because cardiovascularly i dont feel like ive run
4901861 i tried to to the right things in the race tried to go after constantina but my legs werent there
4901862 i didnt feel sick or in distress but there was nothing else i could do
4901863 i knew i was pushing it coming in with three and a half weeks of running you cant take shortcuts in the marathon and i guess i learned that today
4901864 fingers crossed for 2012 look at constantina maybe i can do that in 2012 if my body holds up i know in london ill have all that support
4901865 i dont think this is redemption for athens but it would have been for nothing if i hadnt finished
4901866 to me a human life matters whether black or white beautiful or ugly tall or short rich or poor jew or christian or muslim or atheist sane or insane these are just labels that set us apart all have human dignity there would be no prejudice if we celebrated our similarities we all share and crave love and acceptance for who we are not as someone wants us to be it is difficult to reach out to another to love another without first loving ourselves everyone has a toothache and baggage and it keeps our love from emanating out to another person and up into the universe but when you come to realize that all we have on this earth is our time and our integrity and that we are here to serve each other we all have the capacity to become like mother teresa serving one person at a time one person hurting with a toothache at a time and it could be our spouse our child our neighbor our paper boy or that complete stranger standing over in the corner alone
4901867 of all i have received or given my daughter is the most precious of all having a family is the only gift i have ever given myself as i reflect back i often feel i will have passed through failing to have done anything worthy to deserve one line in the eons of history by many i may be remembered as a real estate agent but i want to be remembered as having given life to a child my life has been empty and meaningless until i reflect on my daughter and her mother my wife my daughter collins gave meaning to my brief tenure on this planet
4901868 how lucky i am to have found charlyn and to have chosen her out of all the choices i could have made there is no doubt i made the right choice
4901869 though i know exactly where my mother wants to be buried and that my father cringes at the thought of his body suffocating entombed in the ground we have not often spoken about death as a family i think that my father almost died in the hospital this past week and the abruptness with which i was reminded of his impending premature death struck with full force a lung transplant could extend his life another ten or fifteen years but the failure of such a major surgery seems to present the possibility of picking ones own date to die we sat huddled in the living room my mom and i on the floor my dad in his favorite chair with the dog on his lap crying grieving and finally talking about the decision that we that my father has to make
4901870 okay that all sounds fine now what can you do about my nose
4901871 dear donor family not too many people on this earth get a second chance at life i did because of a compassionate caring person in your family i was told before the surgery a new lung would improve the quality of my life but perhaps not the quantity i am so thankful to be alive for however long god grants me life i promise you i will honor your gift with my last breath thanksgiving now has a whole different meaning to me i was called to university of colorado hospital on november 23rd at 9 30 pm the surgery from 3 00 am to 8 00 am on thanksgiving put me on the road to a new life only a week before my wife was concerned i would never see 2006 after struggling for breath for ten long years especially the last six months where i had to concentrate on each breath i took the first step in the icu without supplemental oxygen was worth the struggle i now find enormous gratification in the smallest most elemental pleasures taking my first shower after surgery was heavenly waking up in my hospital bed before dawn to the most beautiful winter landscape i have ever experienced living in colorado walking at dawn in washington park when it is still so peaceful with only the soft nuzzling sounds of the geese still snoozing and a few eager squirrels darting about sharing the experience with an occasional jogger or an early riser like myself i find myself weeping for no reason at all except in finding pure joy in my new life thanks to someone who cared enough to become a donor i weep for your family in your loss what a courageous and compassionate gesture to offer part of oneself so that someone might live we are a very active family who enjoy colorado to the fullest we hiked jogged biked swam skied and traveled together until i was about fifty four when i went on oxygen twenty four hours a day since 1996 i missed so many wonderful experiences with my family but i encouraged them not to quit doing the things we once enjoyed together many times my wife and daughter came home from a hike in tears because i was not able to share in some wonderful experience they had encountered that day well now i have nothing to hold me back and a lot to look forward to at age sixty three i feel like i am twenty again in honor of the gift from your family i am exercising daily in anticipation of hiking and the many other things i can enjoy with healthy lungs i will continue to honor my lung as long as i am able by doing my part to keep your gift alive by giving back to pay the good fortune forward and to spread the word of this blessing i will always keep your loved one and your family who gave me a second chance at life in my prayers sincerely and gratefully yours dean

4901945 i told lynn and he said well if that truly is your dream you need to go out there and achieve it
4901946 yeah i think i scared him a little bit today
4901947 i guess thats the job of an athlete to scare their coach and then make them happy in the end
4901948 i knew i had to set a personal record to medal
4901949 thats why that lap we did was very emotional for me i started to get choked up the last 200 meters and i worried i wasnt going to be able to make it around and get up on the medal stand
4901950 but i made it and now i just keep thinking how this was something id been dreaming about since i was kid

4902030 perhaps the crudest defence of abortion rights more often thrown out in anger or in the heat of controversy is the assertion that no man has a right to pronounce on the subject since he does not know what it is like to be a woman an injunction that might tempt a retort no less impertinent that a woman has no right to condemn a rapist since she has no idea of what it is like to be a man
4902031 when it comes to human life we dare not play games with either doubts or definitions if in fact we cannot decide when human life begins then we cannot safely assume that it hasnt begun at a minimum the almost universal agreement that an unborn fetus is both human and living must raise a presumption in favor of human life are we prepared to find out that weve been wrong all along in denying the obvious

4902035 pro life slogan abortion stops a beating heart is incontrovertibly true while images of violent fetal death work magnificently for pro lifers as political polemic the pictures are not polemical in themselves they are biological facts we know this
4902036 have you ever noticed that the only time those of us who are not in the medical profession refer to a fetus is when we talk about abortion in every other case we refer to a baby we dont ask what are you going to name the fetus nor do we console a woman who has just miscarried by saying im sorry you lost your fetus in referring to a pregnancy we invariably understand that we are dealing with a little person developing in the womb only when it is subject to an abortion must a baby go incognito
4902037 findings such as these do not constitute an argument against abortion but they certainly tell us we are not in the realm of tonsillectomies
4902038 what irony that a society confronted with plastic bags filled with the remains of aborted babies should be more concerned about the problem of recycling the plastic
4902039 im personally against abortion but i wont impose my values on others its their choice

4902068 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4902069 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages
4902070 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4902071 theres some pretty grubby and horrible things that happen out there in remote workplaces where farmers have used foreign labour
4902072 if we dont regulate this scheme the illegal practices will continue
4902073 a worker should not earn one dollar less than an australian worker there should be appropriate levels of pastoral care and community involvement in deciding where these workers will be placed
4902074 im not overly comfortable about foreign labour coming into our workplaces but theres an undeniable labour shortage
4902075 im worried about these industries collapsing under the pressure of that labour shortage
4902076 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me

4902095 the problem with horse trading what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in in order to get something else through senator xenophon told the nine network
4902096 the problem with horse trading is sometimes youll end up with a donkey or even worse a trojan horse so i need to decide things on their merit and to use the phrase of the rudd government an evidence based approach and issues have to be taken on their merits

4902127 sometimes the person asking for the id might just be asking for the sake of the video camera to show that they checked it or maybe it has just become so routine to ask for an id that they are not really looking at it the way they are supposed to but when the id reads
4902128 they make it as realistic as possible they might go into one place and grab a six pack of beer and they might grab a bottle of alcohol at another location
4902129 at the time we needed it most our city was there for us
4902130 right now there is a higher demand than supply for solar panels which means that if we bought them now we would be paying a premium price
4902131 so i think we should definitely go ahead with the infrastructure so that they can eventually be installed but just wait a little while on the purchase of the panels

4902138 my heart goes out to the wise family for their loss of j b and i know the community will miss him a lot
4902139 its devastating i just think im numb i dont know what to say i cant believe its happened again
4902140 my prayers are with the family and teri he was such a neat person very knowledgeable very sincere always had a smile always had a laugh had that twinkle in his eye and hell be greatly missed
4902141 extremely intelligent extremely hard working extremely interested in what was best for bullhead city
4902142 and in the short period of time that he was on the council he had a tremendous impact on the council as a whole on the city its just a tremendous loss
4902143 we had the same sense of humor im aggrieved beyond belief i introduced him to bullhead city politics and i convinced him to run i met him when i was campaigning and we were instant friends
4902144 he is the most stand up person ive met in a long time a man of his word he has impeccable integrity i cant even imagine going on without him he was such a great guy to work with and to be involved with on the council i cant believe weve lost him
4902145 he is energetic hes smart he was one of the best things to happen to the city council in a long time hes honest hes open hes ethical theres nothing negative at all about j b
4902146 j b really helped me so much during my transition hes really going to be missed he had so much energy he was so good for our community he brought so much experience its going to be real tough without him
4902147 he was a tremendous asset to our council and he filled a void where a void needed to be filled and i relied on him and his expertise and his counsel im just going to miss him terribly absolutely terribly

4902150 why do some professors look at the clock when class time is up and then continue to talk for another five minutes
4902151 some professors seem to forget that their highly intellectual classes that discuss various aspects of philosophy and are rarely ever useful unless one is philosophically inclined actually should end however they often get bogged down in the little comments on a topic that a student mentions or asks a question about the reading even though they know nobody has read the text and force their students to sit in silence for upwards of a minute this tactic when used several times per class easily makes students late for lunch or other classes
4902152 why are people puking in my hallway at four in the morning
4902153 quite simply they are too drunk at 4am to understand that if they dont stop drinking theyre going to puke very shortly
4902154 why is it still snowing its nearly april and it was warm for a short while
4902155 quite honestly there is no scientific answer as to why spring is revealed to college students for several days and then snatched away like a womans purse the shock is equally present in both cases though i can say however that when your canadian professor is becoming frustrated and says something along the lines of its nearly the end of march it needs to stop that the snow is definitely unnecessary and seems to be a cruel trick by mother nature
4902156 why do people forget and then subsequently leave their underwear on the floor of the bathroom
4902157 because of the importance of securing a shower and then maintaining the possession of said shower it apparently becomes easy to forget ones boxers panties thongs etc on the bathroom floor also the sheer godliness of a warm shower on a cold day after having cold water for two days is reason enough
4902158 why dont people go back to retrieve their underwear from the bathroom floor
4902159 because of their hectic schedules which involve very little homework and much guitar hero iii playing college students often find it hard to remember something as trivial as a pair of boxers panties thongs etc that they left laying on the bathroom floor facing the following fact will save you a lot of trouble in college socializing and video games are much more important than homework and your underwear
4902160 the undergarment seems to disappear into thin air although some collegiate experts usually in their fifth or sixth years at a four year university say that they are forming an underground coalition to take over the world such claims are soundly unfounded however and good theories are usually subjected to pot before reaching this stage

4902165 one thing that im absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue and so i think anyone who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue is not roe v wade and i come to that conclusion not because i am pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually they struggle with these decisions profoundly

4902203 instead i think we can affirm that they are in fact worshiping themselves in that they value their imaginations and preferences above the revealed truth of scripture
4902204 which couldnt be further from the truth therefore i see the proper understanding of this doctrine to be one of the most important issues facing the church today second to soteriology
4902205 divine revelation is the unique foundation the sole norm the only rule of all religious worship if it is to be acceptable to god
4902206 it is clearly laid down that no teaching about god or concerning his worship can be considered true theology except those which he alone has revealed

4902215 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4902216 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
4902217 i have to tell you up front both of these guys are my friends they both care deeply about america they are both patriots

4902247 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4902248 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages
4902249 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4902250 theres some pretty grubby and horrible things that happen out there in remote workplaces where farmers have used foreign labour
4902251 if we dont regulate this scheme the illegal practices will continue
4902252 a worker should not earn one dollar less than an australian worker there should be appropriate levels of pastoral care and community involvement in deciding where these workers will be placed
4902253 im not overly comfortable about foreign labour coming into our workplaces but theres an undeniable labour shortage
4902254 im worried about these industries collapsing under the pressure of that labour shortage

4902278 the idea behind this is the person is sucking in a little bit of water and a lot of air so they feel like theyre drowning the real power of the interrogator is the fear of the unknown
4902279 but i think if youre for or against this technique the conversation about this needs to start we need to recognize what it truly is which is torture

4902310 some companies banks for example used to have eight or nine members now its one or none
4902311 thats hurt all country clubs across america during that time
4902312 i had the time and an idea on how we had to approach it
4902313 it didnt make us debt free but we dont have to service that debt for four years and after that its at a low rate of interest
4902314 from a financial viewpoint for members its not a super investment but its all secured by the clubs assets it made a huge difference in the financial stability of the club
4902315 by restructuring the debt we dont have so much to service the members loaned the money to the club for four years interest free the notes cant be redeemed for a minimum of four years its structured so that if at the end of four years you had to move and wanted to get your money back you could that amount would then be offered to other members and callable every two years it meant we dont have any mortgage payments and were saving a couple hundred thousand dollars each year
4902316 our pool is heated and has lifeguards lounge chairs and tables
4902317 whatever you would like off the menu from steaks to sandwiches to ice cream treats inside or out its the same a lot of places dont offer that
4902318 im amazed at the community and how strong and how willing the people are to keep the community thriving like tuscora park and the school systems so it wasnt surprising to me that the members stepped up
4902319 offer really excellent values and great food those are well attended and pretty popular
4902320 its a tremendous value to companies and to the community in general
4902321 it offers fine dining that is hard to come by
4902322 one of the myths although maybe it was true at one time is that the country club was a place for a bunch of snobs or people who thought they were a cut above thats all gone by the board i really like the ambiance and it has a wonderful golf course thats a great value for the money it may not be for everyones taste but its a really nice facility that helps set us apart from other communities of our size
4902323 im really glad it was here when we came back
4902324 its a wonderful warm welcoming spot with people who know how to have a good time
4902325 it started purely as a social club for families of the dover new philadelphia area when the tuscarawas valley was in its industrial infancy really with the big companies established here and growing at that time
4902326 it was a beacon and a hub for those people establishing business here a place to get together with people who thought the same way they did and were involved in the same things its the same as any club does for anyone who belongs to it
4902327 each new generation puts its own stamp on what the club is
4902328 its remade to appeal to the largest group of that generation the current emphasis is on family its a younger group who wants family activities and ways to improve features for parents children and grandchildren
4902329 our debt hasnt been totally erased simply transferred to the people most concerned about the future of the club in varying amounts
4902330 hes a tremendously talented person with an even more tremendous work ethic

4902333 its just a pleasure to watch him and its wonderful what hes done for the sport
4902334 he brings back memories of mark spitz when he won the seven gold medals in the 1972 summer olympics hes absolutely a phenomenon what mark did for swimming michael phelps can do for the future its just unbelievable

4902403 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4902404 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4902405 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4902406 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4902407 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4902408 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4902409 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4902410 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4902411 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4902412 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4902413 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4902414 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4902415 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4902416 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4902417 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4902418 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4902419 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4902420 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4902421 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4902422 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4902423 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados

4902429 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios

4902431 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

4902437 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4902438 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4902439 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4902440 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

4902444 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4902445 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4902446 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4902447 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

4902449 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4902450 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

4902513 hes now got some consistency and just touch wood he can remain pretty sound
4902514 every now and then he misses one that he should kick and then he kicks that one that he shouldnt kick so its pretty even

4902605 weve got protections in place to make sure that at no point are australian workers displaced
4902606 employers will have to show that they have been making every effort to employ australians and theres an expectation that they then also become involved in the different programs which are available
4902607 there are other areas right across the country that will perhaps be considered for the pilot or a program later on
4902608 what we hope is that scheme will be very much community based that it will be a scheme where the community helps identify the workers who should come across help ensure that they do return after their period in australia and that the benefits of the scheme benefit both the families concerned but the communities as a whole

4902627 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4902628 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4902629 when i signed on for the first season of skippy i was a young and probably naive actor and i was given a verbal agreement that if the show was successful after the first season then wed talk about a few more bikkies in the bikkie tin when it did become successful i soon realised there wasnt going to be anything forthcoming
4902630 for years people have thought i was earning a lot of money from the show but i havent received a single cent since my last pay cheque from fauna about 200 in 1968 when i saw the latest boxed set of dvds i thought ive had enough
4902631 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4902632 if i thought religion had any role to play in politics
4902633 hell no i dont want to hang out with you people when im not getting paid for it

4902641 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4902642 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4902643 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4902644 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4902645 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4902646 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4902647 who are open to doing something on the production side
4902648 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4902649 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4902650 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4902651 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4902652 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4902653 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4902654 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4902655 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4902656 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4902657 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4902658 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4902659 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4902660 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4902661 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4902662 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4902663 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4902664 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4902665 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4902666 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4902667 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4902668 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4902669 here is what i have learned when all hell is breaking loose a car isnt going to do you any good during evaculations the roads are packed and moving 15 miles an hour cars run out of gas cars break down tempers flare the roads move slowly after the 2004 hurricanes 100 year old oak trees in orlando were down and even the most beefy hummer could not get around town yet you could get just about anywhere by bike if you didnt mind lifting the bike over a trunk every once and a while

4902705 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4902706 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4902707 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4902708 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4902709 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4902710 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4902711 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4902712 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4902713 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

4902715 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4902716 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4902717 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4902718 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4902719 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4902720 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4902721 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4902722 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4902723 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

4902729 specialists who inspected those objects found no usable fingerprints on them
4902730 in essence there is no proof of who that stuff belonged to
4902731 could you please tell me what conclusion i should draw from this
4902732 it was declared that huge quantities of weapons and ammunition were handed out to protesters but forensic tests showed that the quantities were not huge
4902733 and even assuming that they were handed out they cannot serve as evidence
4902734 this seems to prove the theory that the police actions had elements of disproportionateness
4902735 this is my subjective view as far as supporting evidence is concerned the situation is quite sad
4902736 if fleeing demonstrators left guns behind them then why is it that during their dispersal which was accompanied by beatings and resistance not a single gunshot was fired
4902737 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4902738 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4902739 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4902740 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4902741 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4902742 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4902743 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4902744 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4902745 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4902746 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4902747 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4902748 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4902749 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4902750 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4902751 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4902752 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4902753 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4902754 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4902755 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4902756 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4902766 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4902767 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4902768 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4902769 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4902770 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4902771 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4902772 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4902773 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4902774 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4902775 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4902776 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4902777 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4902778 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4902779 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4902780 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4902781 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4902782 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4902783 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4902784 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4902785 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4902786 there is no comparison in the swimming world to what michaels done
4902787 it would be like playing seven games of a football season and never ever being behind completing every pass
4902788 its a far more competitive world than it was at any other time in the past its unprecedented
4902789 its absolutely amazing that shes going that fast shes truly remarkable
4902790 she gives me hope for another 20 years she was actually talking about childbrith in the ready room
4902791 she said swimming was painful but nothing compared to that
4902792 chase college of law northern kentucky university law review call for papers e discovery
4902793 the city council is not playing the leadership role needed in setting the proper tone for the rest of the city to follow simply because it is being tolerant of divisive comments made by councilmember weaver and others in the community
4902794 had they as a body not as individuals condemned councilmember weaver it would have sent the proper signal to the rest of the employees and the community that being that this city has a zero tolerance for stereotypes and discriminatory behavior
4902795 there is something terrible happening there we saw burnt tanks on our way here a bomb fell just a few metres away from us near the suram pass and the shrapnel damaged the door of my car
4902796 we left on august 8 the day the war started because we didnt think our visit to georgia would be so dangerous
4902797 we went to the black sea resort of kobuleti everything was calm there but the general atmosphere was very tense what we feared most was the road of course
4902798 on the night of august 8 9 we were woken by strange noises outside the building we were renting an apartment in
4902799 the electricity went off in the whole city television broadcasting had stopped before that the neighbours in the yard said that a war has started and the russian air forces had attacked strategic targets in different cities of georgia
4902800 armenia is very concerned about the situation in south ossetia and expresses hopes that the parties will make efforts to settle the issues under dispute peacefully as soon as possible
4902801 each truck costs about 50 thousand dollars and if the goods are damaged ill face a huge debt leaving aside the fact it cost two thousand dollars to send it to georgia
4902802 but the most important thing is i came home safe and sound i cant believe im on home soil
4902803 next week the platform will be discussed during a visit to baku
4902804 we hope that azerbaijan will accept it as well as the new co operation platform will help in settling the ethnic conflicts in the region
4902805 of course the minsk process is ongoing in the region the united states russia and france are the primary executives of this process but no conclusion has been reached in this process which has taken nearly 13 years we want this process to be accelerated the solution of the nagorno karabak conflict will also end the problems between azerbaijan and armenia
4902806 we asked georgia to participate in this platform our proposal was also welcomed by russia
4902807 we want it to provide for economic cooperation and to lead to cooperation on regional peace and security
4902808 we also want this establishment to assume crisis management and seek solutions in case of a problem in the region
4902809 she tried to put the water hose on it to do what we could do but by that time it was too late
4902810 it was too much fire the water hose wouldnt do nothing
4902811 you could hear them screaming but there was nothing you could do
4902812 in the same area on the first floor at the rear
4902813 but the bodies did appear to have some severe burns
4902814 whatever youre doing inside of me it feels like chaos somehow theres peace
4902815 within the 30 day post operative period mortality was low and less than 10 per cent of patients experienced complications
4902816 patients who underwent the less common gastric bypass procedure were more likely to be readmitted within 30 days of their operation

4902827 amid all the international gloom what a truly wonderful day yesterday for britains olympic hopes
4902828 while the awful summer weather keeps us indoors we can thank team gb for dispelling the gloom there may be clouds over britain but yesterday they had a gold lining
4902829 so for a moment lets forget the politics that seems to have dominated these olympics lets just admire the achievement marvel at the hard work and look forward to more of the same
4902830 all britains olympic medal winners deserve much praise for helping us to feel good about ourselves for showing that we still have among us many determined self disciplined and hard working men and women who are supremely good at what they do
4902831 but the heart lifts especially for rebecca adlington who combines astonishing superlative talent with an engaging very british modesty and humour
4902832 she also makes it look easy when the truth is that her victory is the result of years of relentless training and single mindedness
4902833 that would be great anything that comes as a product of her success is richly deserved
4902834 what she has achieved is amazing i thought she was amazing before this but i love her even more now
4902835 she is the greatest person i have ever met her success has completely blown me away
4902836 im so proud of rebecca and cant wait to see her her achievements are enormous and she is so touched by the reaction of everyone at home
4902837 she has been rewarded for all her hard work and training over the years and hopefully what shes done can spur on a new generation of swimmers to emulate her i dont think what she has done yet has quite sunk in for any of us
4902838 our victorious olympians are genuine role models partly because their prime motivation is not money but rather love of their sport
4902839 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4902840 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages
4902841 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4902842 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4902843 intention to smoke during a future pregnancy was significantly tied to the intention to consume alcohol
4902844 this strong association suggests that strategies aimed at reducing smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy should target both behaviours
4902845 that the lord didnt do it all in one day what makes me think that i can
4902846 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4902847 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4902848 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4902849 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4902850 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4902851 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4902852 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4902853 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4902854 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4902855 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4902856 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4902857 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4902858 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4902859 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4902860 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4902861 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4902862 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4902863 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4902864 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4902865 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4902866 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4902867 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4902868 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4902869 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4902870 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4902871 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4902872 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4902873 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4902874 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4902875 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4902876 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4902877 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4902878 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4902879 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4902880 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4902881 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4902882 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4902883 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4902884 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4902885 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4902886 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4902887 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4902888 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4902889 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4902890 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4902891 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4902892 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4902893 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4902894 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4902895 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4902896 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4902897 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4902898 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4902899 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4902900 this is my friend shes gay isnt that silly must be a hippy
4902901 oh youre jewish you must miss bacon bacon is sooo good i pity you for your lifelong lacking of bacon how about you have some bacon just this once
4902902 i understand that youre okay with being black its just that my whole family has been white our whole lives and rarely ever get sick dont you think being white might be healthier
4902903 this is my friend shes gay isnt that silly must be a hippy
4902904 oh youre jewish you must miss bacon bacon is sooo good i pity you for your lifelong lacking of bacon how about you have some bacon just this once

4902906 no point travelling 12000 miles just to participate we are quietly confident
4902907 i played a year in the diamond valley league but returned to the rdfl when told that i needed to put on weight if i wanted to go on to better things at this time i had started boxing and needed to keep my weight down for fights so when forced to make the choice i chose boxing and decided to stick to local footy
4902908 my first role as a coach was when i started the nottingham scorpions in 2004 i learnt the job quickly through trial and error and feel that i have had a lot of success in coaching players new to the game in 2004 nottingham reached the preliminary finals 2005 won the grand final 2006 lost in the grand final 2007 just missed the finals 2008 are in the preliminary final this week and have a real chance of making the grand final
4902909 the major strength is every players commitment to the team each other individually and to the team plan our aim has been for this to be more than just a composite team hopefully any weaknesses will be identified and ironed out before the tournament
4902910 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4902911 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4902912 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4902913 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4902914 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4902915 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4902916 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4902917 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4902918 jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him
4902919 i think whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a culture perspective to answer it with that specificity is above my pay grade
4902920 that would be the one thing i looked at in the kicking game that i didnt like
4902921 offensively it raises your nervousness in terms of being able to run
4902922 it would be a huge steal for us to find a way to run the ball going into the tennessee game with any consistency
4902923 we just werent playing to our capabilities we seemed flat and like we werent playing like we should be playing so i tried to give some motivation to our guys if youre on the field and running our offense we have to all buy into what were doing
4902924 i came out here calm today for the first time everything worked out for me

4902929 hundreds and hundreds of gallons of water came down the stairway right through the door into the basement
4902930 never in a million years did i expect anything like this to happen
4902931 all of a sudden it was like every night it started raining it was like were in florida
4902932 its fairly expensive so most people choose not to have it i dont have it and im an insurance agent
4902933 the water coming in due to a roof being damaged that would be covered
4902934 the thunderstorms coming through were ripping things up pretty good
4902935 it seems like weve had the 20 year storm every time its rained
4902936 we go in and we have meters and stuff like that to find out where exactly the water has gone we open up walls take out the insulation
4902937 some people wait too long to call us and all you can do is rip everything apart
4902938 its all in the attitude but its never somebodys first choice to have rain on their wedding day
4902939 its something you cant control so youve got to try to relinquish your power and work with it

4902946 one thing that im absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue and so i think anyone who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue is not paying attention
4902947 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and i come to that conclusion not because i am pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually they struggle with these decisions profoundly
4902948 as for the social issues tonight should throw a damper on the notion that obama is going to make major inroads among evangelicals voters why would they vote for his social liberalism couched in exquisite equivocations when they can vote for someone who agrees with them on most everything like john mccain

4902973 councils would step in to deal with an under nourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different
4902974 there needs to be a national debate about the extent to which it is acceptable for local authorities to take action in cases where the welfare of children is in real jeopardy

4902991 come let us climb the lords mountain to the house of the god of jacob that he may instruct us in his ways and we may walk in his paths
4902992 taking up ones cross and following christ is part of entering into lent and the only path in life that leads to the victory of love and peace over hatred and violence
4902993 entering into lent means to enter into a time of particular commitment in the spiritual combat that opposes us to the evil present in the world in each one of us and around us
4902994 it means to look evil in the face and dispose oneself to fight against its effects above all against its causes right up to its ultimate cause satan
4902995 opportunity to follow christ and in this way acquire strength in the battle against sin and evil
4902996 am i laying down my life each moment to become holy
4902997 am i running away from the crucifixion as peter ran from rome to avoid the crucifixion that awaited him
4902998 means to enter into a time of particular commitment in the spiritual combat that opposes us to the evil present in the world in each one of us and around us
4902999 it means not unloading the problem of evil onto others onto society onto god but recognizing ones own responsibility and consciously taking it upon oneself
4903000 opportunity to follow christ and in this way acquire strength in the battle against sin and evil
4903001 entering into lent therefore means renewing the personal and communal decision to face evil together with christ the way of the cross is in fact the only way that leads to the victory of love over hate of sharing over egoism of peace over violence
4903002 seen in this way lent is truly an occasion for determined ascetic and spiritual commitment founded upon the grace of christ

4903073 passi nella direzione sbagliata per il futuro delle comunicazioni mobili
4903074 il tcg si offre per dare una mano alle telecom a blindare i nostri telefonini
4903075 le proposte annunciate fanno in modo che il provider decida chi pu produrre software per il nostro telefono se possiamo caricare o salvare i nostri documenti e anche se posso cambiare gestore o vendere il telefonino non credo che i consumatori saranno entusiasti di queste innovazioni
4903076 lindustria delle comunicazioni cellulari non ha ancora capito che i telefonini sono piccoli computer e gli operatori si aspettano la stessa libert di scelta che trovano sui loro pc e palmari
4903077 lindustria generalmente si divide in due gruppi coloro che apprezzano la possibilit di uno standard unico e quelli che vogliono imporre il proprio per raccattare royalty
4903078 una collaborazione trasversale tra le varie industrie per lo sviluppo di un approccio aperto e amichevole alla libera creazione duplicazione e distribuzione dei contenuti digitali

4903100 ako ang kausap nung alaherang kaibigan ko kaya natural lang na ako naman ang hinahabol niya kailangan kong makuha ang mga alahas kay beth ibabalik ko na lang dahil hindi niya naman nababayaran
4903101 hanggang sa malaman ko na isinanla niya pala ang mga alahas nung puntahan ko siya sa bahay nila sa mandaluyong sinabi niya sa akin na gagawan daw niya yun ng paraan para mabayaran
4903102 maayos ko siyang nilapitan tinanong ko siya kung paano na ang gagawin namin sa mga alahas na kinuha niya pero hindi pa ako nagpapaliwanag nagtata lak na siya agad
4903103 kung ano ano na ang pinagsasasabi niya kesyo ako raw ang maraming problema marami raw siyang alam na problema ko ako pa ngayon ang parang lumalabas na may utang at pangangailangan sa kanya
4903104 ang lakas lakas ng bibig niya nakakakuha ng attention talaga ako ang nahihiya para sa kanya dahil ang dami daming taong nandun na nagtitinginan na sa amin
4903105 basta ako ang alam ko hindi ko ibinubugaw ang anak ko
4903106 dun na nagpanting ang tenga ko sinabi ko sa kanya na magdahan dahan siya sa pagsasalita at baka hindi niya kayang panindigan ang mga akusasyon niya sa akin
4903107 sinabi ko sa kanya na hindi pa kami sumasala sa oras kumakain pa ang buong pamilya namin kaya huwag siyang nagsasalita ng mga bagay bagay na wala siyang pruweba

4903120 la pol tica tiene un ritmo acelerado de respuesta r pida de salir hacia el exterior lo contrario de la filosof a que es un trabajo de acumulaci n interior de rumiar ideas de ir asimil ndolas y complejiz ndolas pero lo hago a gusto convencido creo que es una muy buena etapa para incursionar en la pol tica me ha tocado participar en la votaci n hist rica del senado el 17 de julio

4903130 eso me permiti ir conociendo el instrumental y como pude observar muchas operaciones fui d ndome cuenta de las dificultades que enfrentaban los cirujanos buscando una soluci n para ellos comenc a pensar en este nuevo aparato para las intervenciones laparosc picas
4903131 el jueves en el centro de salud efectuamos una colecistectom a operaci n de ves cula por v a umbilical esta fue la primera cirug a miniinvasiva en todo el mundo que se efectu con este aparato y con esta t cnica
4903132 a las 12 horas de la operaci n le dimos el alta y se fue a su casa y ya pod a darle de mamar a su beb es incre ble
4903133 es decir que se emple un instrumental y una t cnica creada por tucumanos fue llevado a la pr ctica por m dicos tucumanos y en un establecimiento p blico creo que esto es un orgullo para todos nuestros comprovincianos
4903134 l stima que no pudimos ganar me hubiese ido contento aunque fuera con el empate el f tbol tiene estas cosas a veces no te sirve ser el mejor de los dos equipos si termin s perdiendo independiente se encontr con el triunfo en una jugada fortuita y nos quedamos sin nada

4903136 en est tica los m todos se usan en forma escalonada ordenada comenzando por los m s simples hasta llegar a los m s complejos pero el empleo del l ser no significa que no se podr n usar cremas u otros productos de belleza aunque se tenga que llegar al l ser para mejorar imperfecciones y rejuvenecer la piel los dem s recursos de la dermatoest tica se pueden seguir usando
4903137 para que un paciente est contento dijo la docente de la uba hay que seleccionarlo y determinar qu tipo de l ser se le aplicar o no ya que esta t cnica es muy cara y no se puede invertir en algo que no es para todos
4903138 esta es nada m s que un marketing est tico un procedimiento de fantas a
4903139 se trata de un m todo caliente se introduce una c nula con un l ser para degradar la dermis pero no brinda soluciones m gicas diluye pero no extrae la grasa del organismo la nica liposucci n que da resultados es la lipoaspiraci n convencional y esta debe ser realizada por los cirujanos pl sticos y no por los dermat logos
4903140 el l ser diodo de 800 nm nan metros por ejemplo llega a una determinada profundidad de la dermis sirve para la depilaci n definitiva para sacar vasitos etc pero no para rejuvenecer la piel para esto hace falta una luz con menos nan metros 540 nm
4903141 la t cnica es poco invasiva pero algo molesta el paciente siente calor una sensaci n de pinchazos cuando se la aplica pero los resultados son excelentes porque borra todas las manchas y derrames ara itas de la cara

4903162 since this is probably the one and only time something like this will ever happen between us you know im gonna kiss you a lot right
4903163 youre so juvenile rika chan you talk of kisses when all i can think about is stealing second base
4903164 mmmm i i know what second base is and a home run but i cant remember what third base is
4903165 yeah so what youve never made a mistake before own goal score for the other team girl
4903166 why would you bring that up its a completely different thing
4903167 no its the same damn thing its getting a little confused in the throes of ecstasy now stop being bitchy and come back here
4903168 okay okay sorry i didnt mean anything by it now do you feel better
4903169 its not even that you said a different name but whose name it was that you said
4903170 i i didnt mean it like that i was just
4903171 dont tell me to shut up youre not the boss of me i can talk if i want to honestly look at you how pathetic you call me the name of the girl i love in the middle of frankly the best sex ive ever had and you dont understand why im upset but i say something that didnt even mean what you think it means and you began to act all pissy for petes sake stop being such a a girl
4903172 oh ho thats rich coming from the girliest girl ive ever met heh yeah right
4903173 you spoilt whiny crybaby you think you love yossy puhlease thats so laughable a girl like you wouldnt even know what love is unless you were holding a mirror you conceited little and for the record you arent all that cute
4903174 how could you say something like that you dont know me at all
4903175 posso nunca chegar a ser o melhor engenheiro do mundo mas tenha certeza de
4903176 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4903177 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4903178 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4903179 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4903180 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4903181 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4903182 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4903183 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4903184 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4903185 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4903186 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4903187 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4903188 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4903189 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4903190 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4903191 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4903192 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4903193 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4903194 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4903195 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4903196 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

4903203 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4903204 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4903205 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4903206 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4903207 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4903208 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that

4903311 w e have to rethink what sexuality is for many sexuality is simply what happens between two people involving physical pleasure but thats only a small percentage of what sexuality is our sexuality is all of the ways we strive to reconnect with our world with each other and with god a friend of mine has given his life to standing with those who have been forgotten and oppressed the most hes in his early thirties hes single and he talks openly about his celibacy what makes his life so powerful is that hes a very sexual person but he has focused his sexuality his energies for connection on a specific group of people some of the most sexual people i know are celibate they sleep alone you can be having sex with many and yet youre alone and the more sex you have the more alone you are and its possible to be sleeping alone and celibate and to be very sexual connected with many you cant be connected with god until youre at peace with who you are if youre still upset that god gave you this body or this life or this family or these circumstances you will never be able to connect with god in a healthy thriving sustainable sort of way youll be at odds with your maker and if you cant come to terms with who you are and the life youve been given youll never be able to accept others and how they were made and the lives theyve been given and until youre at peace with god and those around you you will continue to struggle with your role on the planet our part to play in the ongoing creation of the universe you will continue to struggle and resist and fail to connect

4903323 usain bolt is a phenomenal athlete it was only a matter of time before he began producing times like hes producing now
4903324 i had a pretty good start i thought i was with usain up to about 15 metres and i just felt him pulling away after that
4903325 i just tried to stay relaxed i felt myself pulling away from the rest and i could see him slowing down and im still pumping to the line
4903326 it definitely shows that you know a lot of people make predictions and they have a certain list of people as to who are going to be the medallists
4903327 but you know i always say once you get on the line in the final anything is possible then
4903328 they have qualified here on their own terms we did not need a wild card to compete
4903329 those years were terrible every day was hearing bad news
4903330 ive just found out one of our athletes has been killed by the taliban while driving on the road to kabul from kandahar
4903331 training in those days was terrible there were bombs exploding around us and people would come in telling us to pray all the time
4903332 there are many different faces different languages here so sometimes they dont like each other
4903333 but when we got the silver medal at the world championships all afghanistan was happy i heard that even the taliban was happy
4903334 we always looked in control and i thought the second goal would come but west brom defended very well and we lacked a bit of sharpness around the box
4903335 we didnt get off to a great start we had one or two opportunities compared to their 15 or 20 but we go away believing we can compete in this league if we work as hard as we did today weve got a chance
4903336 we were on top in the second half and controlled the game we had chances and torres took his hes a key player who can change games
4903337 i was disappointed with the result but very pleased with the performance i was pleased with all the new players but we just did not do enough to get over the finishing line with a draw
4903338 we took the game to fulham we did not sit back
4903339 there is a lot of excitement in the city that we are here for the first time and weve got something to build on
4903340 a little yes but tomorrow i can lose in the final so i have to keep going
4903341 today i think tommy was a little more tired than me and i played well i have won a lot of matches beat a lot of good players and got a lot of confidence
4903342 tomorrow is the most important match i have to play the final like it is my last
4903343 the way he has been playing hes probably feeling pretty good
4903344 it depends on the draw but he is one to reckon with he is probably one of the youngest top players right now
4903345 if he continues this way you have to think he will be in the top 10 pretty soon if not the top five
4903346 i wanted to bring him to the net a bit but i wasnt in a position to do that very often because i was on the defensive
4903347 i am pretty happy with the way i played this week though i just lost to a better player today
4903348 we have got to get there first to see how everything is
4903349 theres no problem as long as our resting and eating times are respected
4903350 but we could do with fewer volunteers there are too many of them around the team

4903353 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4903354 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4903355 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4903356 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4903357 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4903358 this is a planning took where all things are going
4903359 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4903360 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4903361 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4903362 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4903363 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4903364 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4903365 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4903366 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4903367 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4903368 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4903369 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4903370 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4903371 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4903372 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4903373 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4903374 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4903375 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4903376 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4903377 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4903378 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4903379 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4903380 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4903381 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4903382 what we found was that students using social networking sites are actually practicing the kinds of 21st century skills we want them to develop to be successful today
4903383 students are developing a positive attitude towards using technology systems editing and customizing content and thinking about online design and layout theyre also sharing creative original work like poetry and film and practicing safe and responsible use of information and technology the web sites offer tremendous educational potential
4903384 now that we know what skills students are learning and what experiences theyre being exposed to we can help foster and extend those skills
4903385 as educators we always want to know where our students are coming from and what theyre interested in so we can build on that in our teaching by understanding how students may be positively using these networking technologies in their daily lives and where the as yet unrecognized educational opportunities are we can help make schools even more relevant connected and meaningful to kids
4903386 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4903387 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4903388 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4903389 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4903390 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4903391 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4903392 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4903393 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4903394 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4903395 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4903396 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4903397 has appropriately raised serious concerns about the safety of prescribing over the internet
4903398 outperformed the traditional system in most of the safety variables tested
4903399 innovation technology and current medical practice all factor into the outcome of this study
4903400 application of an expert interview system specifically targeted to erectile dysfunction along with a continuous platform for patient client physician communications make this particular internet system comparable to traditional medical practice
4903401 consider using the regulatory model of oversight protections implemented by the state of utah to license internet prescribing companies
4903402 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4903403 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4903404 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4903405 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4903406 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4903407 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4903408 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4903409 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4903410 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4903411 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4903412 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4903413 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4903414 claverach park is close to obtaining a neighborhood designation as a national historic district work has also begun to have the 7500 blocks multi family portion of the moorlands so designated as well and speaking of history have you been on a walking architectural tour of ward ii with elsey hamilton preservationist for st louis county elsey led a fascinating tour of claverach park and the moorlands in early june there are architectural features of homes you may not have noticed before watch the parks and recreation brochure for a tour of your favorite neighborhood
4903415 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4903416 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4903417 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4903418 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4903419 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4903420 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4903421 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4903422 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers
4903423 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with
4903424 some feelings i have not felt in a while but i was excited
4903425 it was the same old brett favre just a different jersey
4903426 im just being a veteran its preseason the first quarter youre just being smart about it if its the regular season im still in there
4903427 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4903428 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4903429 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4903430 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4903431 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4903432 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4903433 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4903434 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4903435 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4903436 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4903437 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4903438 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4903439 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4903440 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4903441 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4903442 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4903443 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4903444 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4903445 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4903446 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4903447 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4903448 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4903449 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4903450 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4903451 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4903452 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4903453 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4903454 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4903455 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4903456 the americans have never lost that race since its been an event in the olympic games
4903457 you have to be very cautious on the relay exchanges and make sure nobody gets disqualified but it should be just a matter of what the time is going to be and whos going to put the gold medal around their neck first
4903458 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of the constitution
4903459 one of the most important jobs of the supreme court is to guard against the encroachment of the executive branch on the power of the other branches
4903460 i think he has been a little bit too willing or eager to give an administration whether mine or george bushs more power than the constitution originally intended
4903461 it worked a lot better than a lot of people anticipated
4903462 i am absolutely convinced that we have to have work as the centerpiece of any social policy
4903463 mr obama too has made millions from his books mr warren reached across the desk and gave mr obama a high five
4903464 im not suggesting that everybody making more than 250 000 a year is living on easy street
4903465 i trace this to a certain selfishness on my part
4903466 this nomination should be based on the critera on a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
4903467 for me as a christian it is also a sacred union gods in the mix
4903468 for gay partners to visit each other in the hospital i dont think limits my core beliefs about what marriage is
4903469 i know there are some here in cal eee fornia that disagree with that position
4903470 leadership involves far more than promoting programs and making speeches and since no one can predict what crises will happen over the next four years it is vital to know the decision capacity and process of each man
4903471 partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
4903472 to restore the churchs primacy in society and not be off on the sidelines to be a part of the world and all the issues
4903473 its a way to use the platform that god has given rick and the church to be a leader and bring everyone together not have the church be over there and separate
4903474 so barack is it true what theyre saying are you the antichrist
4903475 look at this mouth look at these eyes look at these ears look at this hair line
4903476 they match the hairline the ears the mouth the nose the eyes the everything

4903485 masalah two pieces itu tidak menjatuhkan martabat indonesia malah finalis finalis lainnya bangga mereka bilang indonesia sudah maju ya sudah pakai bikini
4903486 memang di indonesia sudah dibilang untuk pakai one piece bukan two pieces tapi adrenaline saya terpacu karena saya berada di medan persaingan saya ingin memberikan yang terbaik
4903487 saya melihat pidato ini secara keseluruhan lebih mengarah pada pidato politik daripada pidato kenegaraan
4903488 seperti pidato politiknya john howard di autralia bush junior dan tony blair ketika ingin mencalonkan diri kembali
4903489 secara obyektif memang ada perbaikan cadangan devisa sudah mencapai 60 milyar dollar itu betul namun demikian juga perlu ada yang perlu dikiritisi secara obyektif pula
4903490 jangan lupa bahwa anggaran kemiskinan itu adalah kompensasi kenaikan harga bbm kompensasi itu tidak lebih dari sepertiga dari dampak kenaikan bbm artinya pemerintah lebih banyak menarik dana dari masyarakat daripada kompensasi yang diberikannya
4903491 pidato presiden sangat kelihatan berbunga bunga seperti kampanye ada kalimat kalimat yang menunjukkan karakter dan ciri ciri partainya ya enggak apa apa masyarakat kita toh sudah cerdas
4903492 jangan sampai tingginya anggaran rapbn 2009 itu hanya merupakan bagian dari kampanye sby menjelang pemilu nanti
4903493 apapun masalahnya kapanpun masanya seberapapun keterbatasannya kalau kita bermental bisa kita semua bisa dan indonesia pasti bisa
4903494 apakah kita bisa melampaui tahun pemilu dengan baik dan damai saya rasa kita sepakat untuk menjawabnya bisa kita bisa

4903510 the vestiges of pagan religion in christian symbology are undeniable
4903511 nothing in christianity is original the pre christian god mithras called the son of god and the light of the world was born on december 25 died was buried in a rock tomb and then resurrected in three days by the way december 25 is also the birthday or osiris adonis and dionysus the newborn krishna was presented with gold frankincense and myrrh even christianitys weekly holy day was stolen from the pagans

4903528 thanks for coming out tonight we are under minded and we hope you enjoyed our part of this amazing show
4903529 did she do any drugs before or during the show was she on anything
4903530 look son its great that you are concerned about these animals but if it crosses the road and gets hit by a car its not a crime
4903531 but they go out of their way to kill them
4903532 i appreciate your concern but theres really nothing i can do
4903533 we can talk out here if you want roy just thought you might want to sit down and be comfortable
4903534 i dont need to be comfortable what do you want
4903535 seems kind of strange that the only motor vehicle accidents weve had all have license plates you called in for hitting animals on the road
4903536 its sad but they killed animals without caring you sure you didnt have anything to do with it
4903537 if these were auto accidents that looked so much like an accident that you didnt think anything of it before youre either stupid
4903538 or the person you are looking for has some knowledge of auto mechanics which i dont have
4903539 or you were lucky enough to have caused so much damage that its unclear if foul play was involved
4903540 come on i watch csi and all of those cop shows
4903541 if that was the case wouldnt you have come with a search warrant and more backup than it takes to feed my dog a piece of meat

4903549 why would microsoft bid against themselves the company sees no reason to bid against itself
4903550 its really the perfect storm of costs with everything thats going on
4903551 its been since the mid 1970s since weve had food product costs rise across the board this quickly
4903552 were hearing from a lot of districts trying to balance a host of challenging costly issues
4903553 the 2 57 definitely does not cover the full cost of lunch
4903554 we never had one before or at least it wasnt singled out on the invoice
4903555 now theyre saying we want you to realize this is part of the cost increase
4903556 we got some but not the numbers as in years past
4903557 bids would lock in for most things for the full year
4903558 a lot of them just broke their contracts now its much more common to have monthly escalator contracts
4903559 this year at the very last minute one of our prime bidders pulled out
4903560 in the past weve had up to five companies bidding for us but this year we had just two
4903561 it takes more labor to produce those items than it does to serve processed chicken nuggets

4903564 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4903565 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4903566 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4903567 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4903568 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4903569 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4903570 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4903571 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change
4903572 this is the challenge for politicians and diplomats strategic military hostility and confrontation must remain a thing of the past
4903573 intention to smoke during a future pregnancy was significantly tied to the intention to consume alcohol
4903574 this strong association suggests that strategies aimed at reducing smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy should target both behaviours
4903575 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4903578 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4903579 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4903580 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4903581 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4903617 the change is not just an election question the change in paraguay is a cultural challenge perhaps the most important in its history
4903618 this is a candidate that won the elections with almost no government program
4903619 lugo is going to have to show that he can form coalitions with the old party structure
4903620 and that is something that fox was not able to do in mexico lugo has no choice but to make deals and pursue allies to help carry out his policy agenda

4903640 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
4903641 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
4903642 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
4903643 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
4903644 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
4903645 we dont want to cause any damage to obamas campaign
4903646 not just the people in gaza but people from all over the world are rooting for this great man

4903696 this is about breaching an artificial line that has divided kashmiris for decades this is about deciding our future ourselves
4903697 this has given them a new sense of victory which may become more difficult for us to contain
4903698 besides and more importantly it has eroded our authority in their eyes the authority of the state itself they are an emboldened lot we are getting demoralised we are in deployment with our hands tied

4903778 there is no comparison in the swimming world for what michael has done
4903779 i think years and years down the road well realize more and more how amazing he is and how special he really is

4903798 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4903799 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4903800 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4903801 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4903802 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4903814 amid all the international gloom what a truly wonderful day yesterday for britains olympic hopes
4903815 while the awful summer weather keeps us indoors we can thank team gb for dispelling the gloom there may be clouds over britain but yesterday they had a gold lining
4903816 so for a moment lets forget the politics that seems to have dominated these
4903817 but the heart lifts especially for rebecca adlington who combines astonishing superlative talent with an engaging very british modesty and humour
4903818 she also makes it look easy when the truth is that her victory is the result of years of relentless training and single mindedness
4903819 that would be great anything that comes as a product of her success is richly deserved
4903820 what she has achieved is amazing i thought she was amazing before this but i love her even more now
4903821 she is the greatest person i have ever met her success has completely blown me away
4903822 im so proud of rebecca and cant wait to see her her achievements are enormous and she is so touched by the reaction of everyone at home
4903823 she has been rewarded for all her hard work and training over the years and hopefully what shes done can spur on a new generation of swimmers to emulate her i dont think what she has done yet has quite sunk in for any of us
4903824 our victorious olympians are genuine role models partly because their prime motivation is not money but rather love of their sport

4903829 stel dat iemand eventjes buitengewoon integer het woonadres van femke halsema opsnuffelt en die tent buitengewoon integer in de fik steekt zou femke halsema die persoon dan ook nog buitengewoon integer noemen
4903830 once upon a time there was a beautiful baby named maya she blessed her parents and the world with her smile and laughter on her 4th birthday her young dream came true and she was transformed in to a pampered princess for just one day she wore the crystal necklace her mom wore to her senior prom her dress tiara and earrings were brought home from paris she drank juice and ate finger sandwiches from the good china with her very pampered princess friends

4903835 we had a committee of the whole as you know and we went through several bills that were introduced yesterday

4903868 cualquier peso por debajo de la tabla es una ganancia muy grande para ellos por la cantidad de carga que hay represada
4903869 si se comprueba un comportamiento reiterado la ley 336 de 1996 permite que la sanci n llegue hasta que se cancele la habilitaci n de la empresa
4903870 aunque nosotros no entramos en paro estamos muy satisfechos de poder aportar un granito de arena en la soluci n al problema de los transportadores
4903871 nosotros no consideramos que el paro sea una soluci n adecuada a los problemas de transporte porque en el mejor de los casos soluciona una tema coyuntural y apaga el incendio
4903872 se requieren leyes estables que le sirvan al transporte y al pa s no solamente en estos momentos sino en el largo plazo si existen pol ticas estables y duraderas se podr an llenan los vac os que llevan a que se hagan paros camioneros porque de todas formas estos paros son nocivos para el sector

4903895 la decisi n administrativa tiene que ver con dos casos un proyecto de hace m s de doce a os de pdvsa y el banco mundial que otorgaron unos fondos luego de un concurso a una organizaci n de nombre educando para la justicia
4903896 la verdadera causa es el miedo a que estemos construyendo una alternativa real popular y mayoritaria en caracas ya ten amos m s del 60 por ciento de apoyo popular lo que significa que la percepci n que se pretende vender del gobierno de que el presidente y el gobierno es el nico que puede llegarles a los sectores m s populares es mentira ch vez dijo que si perd a caracas ten amos que ir a la guerra el presidente y las cabezas de los poderes p blicos dijeron estamos en un estado de guerra por lo tanto ponemos de lado la constituci n y eso fue lo que hicieron es una decisi n que involucra a todos los poderes p blicos la asamblea nacional la contralor a la defensor a del pueblo la fiscal a y el tribunal supremo de justicia tsj detr s de todos est el presidente ch vez y la decisi n la tom l nadie lo duda en el pa s fuera del pa s podr n maquillar para decir que hay autonom a de los poderes pero aqu se sabe qui n los controla
4903897 estoy inhabilitado hasta el 2017 pero voy a seguir en la pol tica en la construcci n de una mayor a popular que est vinculada con una esperanza de un mejor ma ana de una mejor venezuela un proyecto pol tico incluyente tolerante que busque superar los extremos que no entienda la pol tica solamente desde la descalificaci n de quien gobierna
4903898 yo me he replanteado la pol tica en este momento la motivaci n es distinta la construcci n de una mayor a cada vez m s fuerte m s conectada con una visi n compartida de futuro m s comprometida la situaci n me ha sacado de la lucha por un puesto y me ha puesto en una lucha por una transformaci n mucho m s clara m s directa por las injusticias que sufre nuestro pueblo m s all de un partido trabajar reivindicaci n de la justicia y los derechos humanos
4903899 que me voy a estar yendo me asiste la justicia la constituci n y el futuro que abran todas las averiguaciones que quieran me han intentado matar tres veces mataron un compa ero me secuestraron una vez me han seguido personas de la disip polic a pol tica
4903900 hoy por hoy la estamos perdiendo porque era el nico candidato que le ganaba al oficialismo planteo algo concreto que le demos una segunda vuelta al proceso de unificaci n de candidaturas para no perder hay que crear un clima de opini n en el que se muestre que la unidad es un valor estrat gicamente superior a cualquier diferencia que pueda existir
4903901 ciertamente creo que debe haber una renovaci n fuerte en la pol tica pero hay barreras fuertes yo mismo las he sufrido tuve que dar una lucha no solo en contra del gobierno sino de una buena parte de la oposici n pero he ganado un respaldo popular y no de las c pulas
4903902 est muy polarizada muy cansada del conflicto muy frustrada frente a las ofertas incumplidas se ve en el espejo y mira los mismos problemas que ten a hace diez a os una venezuela que permanece encerrada en el miedo por la inseguridad y la injusticia est en los niveles m s cr ticos de muertes violentas es un proceso acumulativo que generar un punto de inflexi n que no se sabe como va a culminar
4903903 yo creo que ha generado una reflexi n profunda sobre la exclusi n sobre la pobreza sobre la divisi n en nuestro pa s
4903904 los recursos son escasos tambi n nos limita y con raz n el hecho de que por mandato constitucional debemos darle prioridad a la poblaci n desplazada
4903905 pero es importante aclarar que los problemas m s graves tienen que ver con la poca voluntad pol tica que han demostrado algunos alcaldes que no facilitan la llegada de proyectos de vivienda de inter s social en sus municipios
4903906 no atienden al mandato constitucional de crear en sus planes de ordenamiento alternativas de vivienda para la gente m s pobre
4903907 la definici n del plan parcial de ordenamiento para ese sector se demor tres a os cuando la tierra ya cont con la norma necesaria se tuvo que construir un proyecto estrato cuatro porque la tierra ya se hab a valorizado mucho y los constructores no tuvieron alternativa
4903908 y usted sabe el impacto que tiene la construcci n de mil casas esto nos tiene sufriendo y de no aprobarse se generar a un gran da o social
4903909 tenemos que cumplir una norma de sismoresistencia que es fundamental para el desembolso en ese sentido tenemos que ser rigurosos y esto hace que los tiempos de espera se alarguen
4903910 no queremos correr el mismo riesgo que con en inurbe empezaban a desembolsar y al tiempo se descubr a que no hab a obra ni hab a proyecto por esa v a se perdieron muchos recursos ahora tenemos que cuidar ese patrimonio
4903911 hay que crear mecanismos de cr dito expeditos no podemos seguir siendo tan conservadores tenemos que confiar en la gente los colombianos no se parrandean la casa
4903912 no hemos podido encontrar un mecanismo que convierta una cuota mensual en parte de un ahorro para que una familia tenga su casa
4903913 a esto se de le debe agregar que cada a o se conforman 18 000 nuevos hogares de los cuales 15 000 requieren vivienda de inter s social el subsidio de vivienda en colombia funciona a partir de tres mecanismos
4903914 im happy to be here to share it with you

4903919 i just want to feel some rhythm i want a thousand guitars
4903920 es necesario que haya concurso para que los magistrados lleguen por m ritos y no por favores
4903921 ni durante el periodo de ejercicio de sus funciones ni dentro del a o siguiente a su retiro
4903922 there were some feelings i havent felt in awhile but i was excited
4903923 hes going to be there the thing is can the other players get the job done to help brett along
4903924 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4903925 im a 94 overall i think thats the biggest year to year ratings jump in madden history
4903926 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as somewhat loving
4903927 i cant help have a touch of jack shadbolt who himself was strongly influenced by graham sutherland picasso and various hard edge painters and of course west coast native art forms his life and art were strong expressions of the interface between these two worlds from his home on capital hill one could see from his studio windows the human worlds massive stranglehold on west coast natural forms they themselves having powerful visual elements
4903928 my studio overlooks a few acres of wild meadow where i hut hay for mulch there is a wonderful display of wild grasses osier dogwoods hawthorn rosebushes thistles golden rod and buttercups
4903929 i was visiting my brother who lives in a similar doukhabor community home across the road from there i saw this place for the first time dark and mysterious in the distance when i walked by it i thought what a marvelous studio it would make in spite of its sagging porch roof missing windows and decayed roof so i bought it
4903930 farms and gardens are about the extent of forgiveness i have for human intervention on the land there is a marked difference between them and the other ways in which mankind imposes itself over nature with its concrete asphalt and cutblocks you can see it with subdivisions the first thing they do is go in and scrape everything off
4903931 all the trees all the topsoil everything goes theres nothing left
4903932 theres still some old blackcurrant bushes left in the back
4903933 one of my favourite visuals is in the okanagan valley where the orchards are laid out in rows but they hug and follow the curves and hollows of the land so you get these interesting effects with perspective and foreshortening
4903934 i felt so out of control in that unnatural environment i felt insecure about not being able to grow my own food i could make my living easily but i depended on other sources for what i ate there was too much smoke and above all else the automobile congesting the air and the earth a relentless dictator devastating natural form i was disconnected from nature and ungrounded
4903935 im up and out the door by seven or eight in the morning three or four days a week no matter what i take a drive and decide what i want to draw and paint the scene and setting
4903936 i like to locate myself in different environments and experience the conscious and subconscious response to the stimulation the work is an attempt to blend the worlds of the conscious and the intuitive
4903937 i put the drawings aside usually not referring to them and commence painting all my gear is set up beforehand i dont know ahead of time what the image will be until the brush starts across the canvas the form grows without forcing
4903938 except sometimes the form needs to be forced there is a fine line between chaos and art with the only thing keeping it from tipping over being experience
4903939 after i choose my spot taking into account the amount of light the exposure the amount of room i have to move around i set up my space usually i have a table and an easel i will cover the surface with an umbrella or a tarp i need lots of room to move around about 30 40 feet around me so i will clear away fallen logs and twigs i will even sweep the ground and maybe even lay down a bit of carpet i want to be able to get back quite far and look at the painting from a distance then move in quickly while the decision is still fresh in my mind as to what needs to be done next
4903940 often by chance i find a place out of the wind on a cold day in the shade of summer a relatively benevolent environment and by the ways of serendipity also a place of wonder and beauty
4903941 so what if the form at times in the end seems awkward when completed almost desperately under conditions perhaps such as fatigue cold intense heat and glare cramped in awkward spots
4903942 or the day starts as benignly perfect for painting the view the weather my mood all aligned then the day changes a cold breeze springs up changing my mood and colour my body is cramped i need a good stretch but there isnt time
4903943 i dress in a lot of layers i will paint with my gloves on all year round as i use toxic substances im such a tall lanky fellow the extra weight and layers dont impede me if the weather is good ill take it all off i like to paint barefoot to be as close to the feeling of nature as possible
4903944 im the only guy who has ever painted most of the watersheds and creeks and river sources around here
4903945 i was the first and i will probably be the last no one else can accomplish this since most of these places are disappearing some of them are already gone
4903946 once i discover a place that has all the qualities of a good painting spot i tend to return to it to paint
4903947 it takes command of the space well and easily its handled with the absolute deft economy of the brush and for that reason it carries and real sense of quiet strong conviction about it as a sort of sketch painting which holds itself complete its the kind of thing that the chinese masters did and worked on till they mastered this deftness over and over and over again
4903948 in the winter of 1966 67 i spent a semester at the art school in gloucester england it is a very picturesque part of the midlands the cotswolds lots of river valleys farms and forests i also found the architecture to be very inspiring especially the romanesque arches the forms were very natural when i came back to western canada i saw those same shapes in the trees
4903949 i am shedding preconceived notions of what things are like and accept the transience of appearances that things
4903950 im very ticked if you really want to know the truth
4903951 they might as well be moving to outer new jersey so he doesnt care hes got no attachment out here i cant imagine driving by here next summer and not seeing them
4903952 all the great players that walked through the same door

4903958 confirmo que nuestra oferta a rusia sobre la posibilidad de inspeccionar de la base sigue siendo actual
4903959 meu maior fracasso moral e eu fui uma pessoa muito imperfeita foi o fracasso do meu primeiro matrim nio
4903960 o fracasso moral dos estados unidos foi que atrav s de nossa exist ncia talvez n o tenhamos nos dedicado a causas maiores que nosso pr prio interesse

4903969 people may be setting themselves up to have more persistent problems by being stressed and anxious when allergy attacks begin
4903970 the stress seemed to affect them into the next day
4903971 my intention is to steal a lot of your lines
4903972 id be surprised if it is as simple as a firmware upgrade of the chip so it is more likely that existing devices will have this defect forever
4903973 the chilkat valley in haines is the site for the worlds largest annual gathering of bald eagles
4903974 the bush administrations just released management plan for the tongass national forest in alaska puts millions of pristine acres in this ancient rainforest on the auction block to the timber industry yet will raise no revenue for the u s government as the u s taxpayers themselves will have to pay to build the roads the timber companies need to access the forest the tongass is the largest national forest in the country
4903975 at 17 million acres roughly the size of west virginia the tongass national forest in southeastern alaska is the countrys largest national forest and the worlds largest intact coastal temperate rain forest it contains grizzly and black bears wolves eagles and five species of wild alaskan salmon under the new plan about 3 4 million acres of the forest would be open to logging and development of this acreage about 2 4 million is in roadless areas and about 663 000 acres is considered to have trees valuable for timber production
4903976 this analysis represents the first direct comparison of cortisol responses to stress in lactating and nonlactating females in nonhuman primates we found no evidence of hyporesponsiveness to stress among lactating females rather plasma cortisol levels were significantly higher in lactating than in nonlactating females both shortly after capture and the morning after
4903977 concerns over risk to their infants may explain why lactating females exhibited higher cortisol responses to trapping and individual housing and why these responses did not vary significantly across the 6 lactation months
4903978 theres no lightning so we can rule that one out
4903979 it shows great disrespect for nature that someone would start a fire
4903980 you walked out the door and you could just hear it crackling

4903997 my laboratory studies umbilical cord blood it is useful for replacing blood forming cells in children that have been treated for cancer however it cannot do the same things as embryonic stem cells that is why there is near universal agreement among respected scientists and patient advocacy groups that current restrictions should be relaxed

4904001 frankly i think patrick ohannigan ought to be out there making a bazillion dollars from his writing
4904002 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4904003 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4904004 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4904005 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4904006 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4904007 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4904008 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4904009 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change
4904010 this is the challenge for politicians and diplomats strategic military hostility and confrontation must remain a thing of the past
4904011 in the last week or two weve had some beneficial rains which have helped
4904012 but it will take quite a bit of time to catch up the levels for the reservoirs and the ground water in the long run in the next couple of months well not get enough rain to fill up the lakes and things like that
4904013 freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction we didnt pass it to our children in the bloodstream it must be fought for protected and handed on for them to do the same or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our childrens children what it was once like in the united states where men were free
4904014 children should be educated and instructed in the principles of freedom
4904015 that the said constitution be never construed to authorize congress to infringe the just liberty of the press or the rights of conscience or to prevent the people of the united states from keeping their own arms
4904016 before a standing army can rule the people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in europe the supreme power in america cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a superior force to any band of regular troops that can be on any pretense raised in the united states
4904017 but this is a red light saying there should be some epidemiological study in human populations
4904018 eucerin original creme has been on the market for more than 100 years and is a highly respected dermatologist recommended brand
4904019 it has been widely used by both individuals with normal skin and those with diseased skin under the care of physicians without any incidents of this nature ever reported
4904020 vanicream skin cream has been safely recommended and used for nearly 30 years
4904021 dermovan is a very small product so small i didnt know we provided it anymore
4904022 its been around probably 50 years and theres never been an issue with the safety of the product
4904023 is similar to humans who may be exposed early in life to a lot of sunlight then not as much later in life but still come down with skin cancers
4904024 ive been in practice 30 years and we dont find any problem with using moisturizers
4904025 as far as we know clinically we havent seen an increase in tumors
4904026 i cant refute the article but its hard to believe an application of moisturizer to most people who have had some exposure to the sun over the years that this would promote tumors
4904027 intention to smoke during a future pregnancy was significantly tied to the intention to consume alcohol
4904028 this strong association suggests that strategies aimed at reducing smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy should target both behaviours
4904029 the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe those days are gone
4904030 everyone in my tent asked you mom to bring tons of cookies chocolate chip just like last year emily says 40 please

4904035 i felt a little tired in the sixth inning its difficult to pitch when you are tired i think im not used to running the bases i had a bad inning but thats ok we won the game
4904036 i was trying to achieve the impossible i guess the amount of running ive done coming in wasnt enough
4904037 cardiovascularly i felt comfortable but my legs had gone my calf went first then it went up the entire leg and it felt like i was running on one leg but i didnt do all that work for nothing its just really frustrating
4904038 i was going to the finish line no matter what i did all the hard work and it feels frustrating because cardiovascularly i dont feel like ive run i tried to do the right things in the race tried to go after constantina but my legs werent there
4904039 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
4904040 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
4904041 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
4904042 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
4904043 we are now in a fight against the great russia
4904044 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own it is important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
4904045 president medvedev informed members of the security council of the russian federation that he had signed the document on principles
4904046 they are not following the agreement what do they want here
4904047 i want to go to gori ive left my family there i am bringing food for them but they wont let me pass
4904048 im from tbilisi i was here working when the war broke out i was taken in

4904050 one of the foremost laws in the country as well as in the bible is against murder and heres the kicker if abortion truly is murder then it should be illegal period
4904051 homosexuality is shown to be irresolvably harmful to society at large so it is not a thing that the government should promote by for example allowing them to get married and adopt children
4904052 it seems to me that sin is a concept that can only be understood properly in spiritual terms something the world cannot comprehend
4904053 i would simply suggest that we not struggle too much with getting someone who by his very nature cant understand sin or its gravity to stop sinning
4904054 the world must simply trust us when we speak of grace
4904055 he can be called the best olympian of all time
4904056 not because he has more gold medals than anybody but in the way hes handled himself and in the way hes actually won under a tremendous amount of pressure
4904057 when it is resolved i mean the underlying conflict it must be resolved on the basis of the territorial integrity of georgia
4904058 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4904059 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4904060 when i came to you brothers i did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as i proclaimed to you the testimony about god
4904061 i came to you in weakness and fear and with much trembling my message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words
4904062 some say his letters are weighty and forceful but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing
4904063 yeah were aware of that they signed releases so were not responsible okay
4904064 well jesus i really felt pumped up when i can to church that pastors sermons really set me on fire i learned all sorts of neat practical advice to live a happy and successful life
4904065 for i resolved to know nothing while i was with you except jesus christ and him
4904066 i resolved to know nothing except jesus christ and him crucified
4904067 my message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of the spirits power so that your faith might not rest on mens wisdom but on gods power
4904068 whatever else may be thought about hitlers exploits they are among the most remarkable in the whole history of the world
4904069 eighty six percent of chinese people surveyed said they were content with the countrys direction up from 48 percent in 2002 and 82 percent of chinese were satisfied with their national economy up from 52 percent
4904070 russians were the third most satisfied people with their countrys direction at 54 percent despite western concerns about authoritarian trends
4904071 an average of 24 percent of hip fracture patients age 50 and over die within a year of the fracture
4904072 they may have been borderline able to walk before the fracture then this really sets them back
4904073 as long as you keep on learning you will never live an empty day
4904074 you cant turn back the clock but you can rewind it
4904075 cherish what is dearest while you have it near you and wait not til it is far away
4904076 with an eye made quiet by the power of harmony and the deep power of joy we see into the life of things
4904077 for i dippd into the future far as human eye could see saw the vision of the world and all the wonders that would be
4904078 i am an old man past the allotted three score years and ten and as the old do quite often wake up in the middle of the night half out of my body so that i see between the sheets the old battered carcass i shall soon be leaving for good and in the distance a glow in the sky the light of augustines city of god
4904079 we must not cease from exploring and at the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and know the place for the first time
4904080 death plucks at my ear and says live i am coming
4904081 ive gone through a lot of things and i have the support of my teammates it feels good to be back on the field just around the guys im back at home its definitely been a big weight lifted off me
4904082 i was kind of pessimistic how my teammates would receive me
4904083 there were a lot of rumors i admitted to my teammates i created a lot of those rumors at the time coach reid didnt know the truth people were saying it was really about his contract didnt want to play football anymore and i admit that i created those rumors just out of a lot of frustration and didnt care what people thought
4904084 they really didnt know you have a guy whos quick tempered whos to the point where i really didnt care anymore thats not the real me i just didnt realize what i was going through a few weeks ago was the first time ive ever opened up to anybody about anything that was part of the reason
4904085 coach reid after he realized that shawn andrews did have a serious problem he was very positive about the situation hes a funny guy he helps you laugh tries to make the situation better
4904086 it wasnt that i was trying to get out of work
4904087 i know there are great fans but there are also people and i will say i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing and that even put more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me people say a lot of times well i dont care what people say about me me personally i dont care about how people perceive me when they look at my hair but i like for people to think great things about shawn andrews but you cant please the world
4904088 it feels great ive gone through a lot of things and i have the support of my teammates it feels good to be back out on the field around the guys
4904089 im very confident if theres anybody that doubts me nobody shows it theres nothing but support here thats the good thing about the organization they do a great job of getting good character guys here i feel back at home
4904090 the last week its been pretty tough i was kind of pessimistic as to how my teammates would receive me back its been tough im still going through a lot but im just trying to make it its been a big step for me
4904091 i dont want to go too far in depth but there were a lot of rumors like i said i admitted to my teammates that i created a lot of those rumors at the time coach reid didnt know there were people saying contract didnt want to play anymore and i admit that i created those rumors out of a lot of frustration and i didnt care what people thought
4904092 yeah because they really didnt know you have a guy whos quick tempered who is now to the point where he really didnt care anymore that wasnt the real me i just didnt realize what i was going through a few weeks ago was the first time i ever opened up to anybody about anything that was part of the reason
4904093 it did make me feel comfortable coach reid after he realized that shawn andrews did have a serious problem he was very positive about the situation hes a funny guy i mean he helps you laugh and tries to make the situation better but ultimately he really showed that he cared and that meant a lot to me
4904094 i did hear about that i think it was his rookie year and his second year going through basically what im going through
4904095 being that im getting help now and im opening up more its definitely been a big weight lifted off of me i can stay prayed up about the situation and just know the difference of when i walk onto the field and try to compose myself because ive always felt alone after opening up to a couple people i definitely feel like i better know how to handle the situation
4904096 i would love to play against the patriots i mean it feels good to be back and around my teammates you dont get that camaraderie in too many other places
4904097 ive been running very hard and have used some of my emotions and aggressions in my workouts this morning i weighed in at 331 pounds and im feeling pretty strong thats lighter than what im going to play at on game day i just want to keep reassuring myself that i have the means and the mindset to keep the weight off
4904098 i guess now that ive spoken about my issues or my clinical depression if you will i think it really lifted a weight off of me because i received so many letters and emails good and bad but i just pay attention to the good ones and the people that i inspire that let me know that
4904099 it was actually it wasnt the day until my appointment to see my doctor back in arkansas because all of the people that were close to me my mentor who ive known for nine years who ive never opened up to he basically came to my house people coming to my house unannounced to get me out and to talk and to see whats going on because i was in my room talking to people just thinking they were very concerned and i was on the edge things werent going well so i felt like i must open up before its too late
4904100 i wont say that i contemplated suicide but i had some very i guess in my mind to me unrealistic thoughts about a lot of things i was really lost and just really felt like there was no outlet i know theres my mom there but i want the rest of her life to be worry free so i try and keep everything from her i just felt alone you know
4904101 ive received a lot of phone calls from public figures and people who have gone through what im going through ive also learned that among african american men and really men period we just hold things in whether its a football player or a man you are still like im a man nothing bothers me but if you internalize it it has to come out somewhere people question my silliness but im a fun loving guy being around people i dont care what creed you are it just ignites my silliness youll never know if im hurting on the inside i found out
4904102 ive actually thought about that im still kind of debating in my mind i know they are great fans but there are also people i will say for a minute that i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing that even put more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me people say a lot of times i dont care what people think about me me personally i dont care how people perceive me when they look at my hair but i like people to think great things about shawn andrews but you cant please the world
4904103 i am very confident that things will work out im not a religious man im spiritual i think a lot of it has to do with god having a calling on my life sometimes it takes bad things to wake you up and realize that god wants you to be who he wants you to be
4904104 there were a lot of things going through my mind first and foremost it was just good to get back with my fellow offensive linemen the kind of fun that we have i really missed it and just being in the huddle with donovan he is a very charismatic guy and it kind of helps for that moment to take away the issues in your mind it was just refreshing a beautiful day
4904105 it was old times i wasnt in there anticipating it i was just out there and wherever they got me to thats kind of how it went
4904106 coach reid allowed me some time after one of the team meetings to address my teammates i just felt like it was something that i needed to slash had to do because of the way that i just disappeared like i said the things i said that conveyed to them that i didnt want to be here anymore or whatever thoughts were in their minds i just wanted to let them know that it wasnt that i was trying to get out of work im no stranger to hard work i just wanted them to know that i hope they still respect me if they dont im going to do everything possible to gain the respect back

4904177 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4904178 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4904179 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4904180 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4904193 you never know when any talent is going to be available so you have to constantly keep in check
4904194 its a couple of things one you look to try to see if theres somebody you can sign now and two for the future
4904195 some clubs will have no players some will have eight or 10 and some will be available and some wont be available
4904196 if you went to japan it might take you a month to see all those guys
4904197 but were not skipping anybody you just never know sometimes guys at a young age throw 85 86 mph and three or four years later you see them again and theyre throwing in the lows 90s
4904198 bottom line you have to be really good in the dominican and venezuela
4904199 but its also always good to have other resources to cover other ground

4904250 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4904251 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4904252 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4904253 getting out of the pocket and making plays is something were going to be doing this year
4904254 we didnt stop them and a lot of that came from jackson scrambling

4904268 we dont want to diminish the quality of the living experience when we have more students
4904269 weve looked at some of the individual departments where we anticipate that we may have higher needs and have looked at staffing issues and re assigning duties to make sure that were paying attention to the program that way
4904270 the students are very attracted to the four year residential experience
4904271 this is pretty unusual to have over 90 percent of your students living on campus for four years
4904272 we want to make sure that we create that market shift pro actively through our efforts rather than having the market change us

4904275 kami hanya ingin mengekspresikan nasionalisme kami dengan cara yang sederhana namun khidmat ritual ini juga sebagai alat mempererat komunitas kami
4904276 sampai saat ini kami belum merasakannya upacara ini juga sebagai ajang untuk instrospeksi atas apa yang telah kami perbuat untuk negeri ini
4904277 sejujurnya saya ingin sekali ada rekan rekan dari wartawan yang mengikuti audisi ini karena saya yakin ada dari kalian yang berbakat
4904278 saya melihat dalam pekerjaannya wartawan pasti memiliki saat saat dimana harus merasakan penderitaan ketika harus mencari maupun meliput berita dan menurut saya sisi itulah yang meyakinkan saya kalau pencari berita cocok dengan beberapa adegan dalam film ini
4904279 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4904280 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4904281 it was really nice to see him move the ball in the middle of the field and run with it
4904282 i thought chad did a nice job of managing the game all around
4904283 we didnt move the ball we got totally stuffed offensively defensively we never slowed them down special teams never won the field position it was an ugly half to be honest
4904284 being able to share this with somebody somebody you like very much
4904285 we all knew we needed this game and we get down 4 0
4904286 we got a little fire in our belly and the coaches got after us after the first couple innings because we werent having good at bats
4904287 i dont think we even expected this to turn out as it did
4904288 it was good to come out two weeks in a row and get a sustained drive and some third down conversions
4904289 then weve got to eliminate the three and outs we cant go long drive then two three and outs and then go another 10 play drive we just have to have sustained drives
4904290 if we can go back out there and get a four five or six play drive it at least gives our defense a little rest
4904291 its something weve got to work on but thats why you have the preseason
4904292 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4904293 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4904294 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4904295 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4904296 it was something for us personally to see where do we measure up with the world champ
4904297 hopefully weve learned a lesson and will be ready the next time
4904298 it screwed up my whole olympic experience i had to take the layup even though i didnt want to shoot
4904299 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4904300 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4904301 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4904302 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4904303 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4904304 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4904305 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

4904308 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4904309 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4904310 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4904311 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4904312 hey maybe im not as bad as i thought maybe i am enough

4904323 i thought the first half was one that both offenses moved the ball some
4904324 we had a nice drive opening up again and got points on the board but again a penalty got us down in the red zone that always gets you and got us backed up when we had a chance to score on the second drive
4904325 i thought offensively were moving the ball we had an opportunity to score some points but didnt get any on the board early we had to kick field goals i thought we protected the ball well in the first half we didnt lay it on the ground didnt throw any interceptions
4904326 defensively they had the one drive where third downs got us they got a third and eight and a third and 11 and converted which isnt very good but i thought we hit the quarterback we got to the quarterback some tonight which is good
4904327 we intended to play a lot of man to man coverage tonight to see if our corners could cover these receivers i think for the most part they held up they did an okay job covering these guys theyve got some gifted receivers
4904328 then our second group got in and did similar to what they did last week they kept their first group in their offensively their line and their quarterback they just moved the ball methodically down the field thats the bad thing
4904329 now offensively we did some things in the fourth quarter again where we moved the ball and got in scoring position and then they got the tip for an interception but then we got the ball back and took it back down and scored well get something out and something we can build on
4904330 i thought he did okay but we were very tentative with him we didnt want to put him in there too much but this week hell get to play a lot we anticipate that but for the most part he did okay its the first time he played in a game
4904331 we just had in a number of plays that he was going to be involved in he hadnt been rushing on nickel rush you dont want to get him too much too soon he hadnt practiced a lot and we just wanted to get him a couple snaps that was good
4904332 i thought he did good he was on a pretty good receiver and all pro guy two all pro guys really the first play we knew they were going to go deep on him we told him we know theyre going to go deep on you every time they line up we told him theyre going to throw the ball at you hes a competitive guy it wasnt too big for him they got a pass but it didnt phase the guy

4904589 i did not set out to offend anybody but sometimes when you are making an r rated comedy that happens
4904590 that is not what i set out to do but i think the movie is good and it speaks for itself
4904591 the jokes are all in context of what some actors are willing to do to win an oscar
4904592 that is a longstanding joke in hollywood that certain types of roles like the one joked about in the film help put you in the minds and eyes of the academy voters and to what lengths some actors will go to bring one of those gold bad boys home
4904593 t heres a part of me thats a little puzzled and disappointed like where were you when radio came out because that was pretty offensive
4904594 or where were they when they made that rosie odonnell riding the bus with my sister film because that was way worse in my eyes than our film

4904601 what a great moment in the history of race relations that a black presidential candidate can say that he would not have nominated clarence thomas because he wasnt qualified enough

4904635 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4904636 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4904637 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4904638 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4904639 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4904640 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4904641 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4904642 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4904643 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4904644 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4904645 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4904646 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4904647 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4904648 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4904649 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4904650 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4904651 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4904652 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4904653 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4904654 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4904655 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4904656 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing

4904661 to a certain degree i dont really know what ive gotten myself into
4904662 the scrutiny there is going to be tenfold what he went through in green bay
4904663 new yorks got a bigger zoo and more restaurants but the passion for professional football is very similar in each place
4904664 in green bay every single person kid child man woman knew who he was no matter where he went
4904665 in new york you might find a couple people that might not recognize him he might be able to slide through the radar a little better with more people and crowds
4904666 brett does some things on instinct and you dont want to coach him out of a good play
4904667 when you get a new quarterback in getting him on the same page with terminology is the biggest challenge
4904668 everything that happens here gets magnified more than anywhere else in the world
4904669 you are in the spotlight all the time so you have very little room for mistakes
4904670 i think the only situation thats going to be tough is if he doesnt come out and play at a high level
4904671 hes never dealt with that kind of scrutiny im not sure new york and the media will be as kind if he goes out and isnt playing at that kind of level
4904672 in some ways its like a rod coming to the yankees but there is a big difference
4904673 everyone keeps pushing on the fact alex has never won a world series favre has won a super bowl and been in another one and he has such a colorful personality perfect for new york alex is a spectacular player spectacular but all the color favre brings to the game makes it different
4904674 he may want to be under the radar but that is going to be impossible in new york with all the media attention he understands what he has to do hes been no 1 for so many years he knows exactly what his responsibilities are i have no doubt he knows what hes facing
4904675 it will be much different for him as compared to what he is leaving in green bay it will be very fun to watch nothing would surprise me i expect that hell do well there and we wish him the best
4904676 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming
4904677 what would it mean to find these secret moons in orbit around the earth in the same way that galileo found these moons that shouldnt exist in orbit around jupiter

4904686 this happened two days after he came home to sydney
4904687 his mother got a text about five or six hours before he was attacked saying he was at a party having a great time
4904688 a brutal and cowardly attack occurred just at the intersection of kidman street and he was left in a grave condition on the footpath
4904689 he was discovered a short time later by another gentleman who was on his way home
4904690 continued ability to work in a field where the boundaries are well defined and political interference or censorship will not be tolerated
4904691 having read the bill we feel obliged to state that the measures relating to tax incentives introduce an element of uncertainty which would have a negative financial impact on the production of canadian and quebec film because the minister might be able to call for the repaying of tax credits after the film has been completed
4904692 by sharing stories weve started the process of turning strangers into friends
4904693 look for a way through mutual understanding and empathy to live a life free of violence
4904694 occupying a nation by building walls and barriers will not secure another nation maybe this will bring a psychological solution but it will not bring a human being solution that people can live together or side by side
4904695 you are not my enemy your fear is my enemy i am attacking today your fear so please dont throw your problems to the sea because those problems learn how to swim you cannot ignore the whole reality by taking a side or being right i remember that gandhi once said that there is no way for peace peace is the way you first do peace without any condition

4904699 i have a lot more time for that i just want to win
4904700 so this is what our government thinks of us and this is how it sees fit to treat its citizens
4904701 the truth is that since the last year or so i havent got good film offers at all trash was coming to me in the name of scripts i am not insecure that i would go for any role im in a position now that i dont need to compromise
4904702 i took a sabbatical for a year and a half and that is when people in the industry realised my worth i have some good films now both as an actor and a producer and i am very happy
4904703 popcorn motion pictures is my obsession i started my career as a businessman with a restaurant and garment business but suniel shetty the businessman can take over only movies and not any other venture
4904704 action has risen to a different level today it is mostly special effects we used to perform our stunts on our own and today the actors use all kinds of props there lies a difference between men and boys now
4904705 after watching the show i think guys should stop talking about action and start getting inspired from women
4904706 ive learnt a lot today i understand my character i have tried my hand at everything from action romance to comedy im the only actor to have worked with over 90 directors and different roles
4904707 money comes last and self respect comes first for me i want to have goodwill in the industry im only looking forward to people appreciating my work in the future

4904710 rakha bandhan is always special for me as my two sisters celebrate it in a big way every year and this year it is even more special because it also coincides with my birthday
4904711 on earlier occasions of raksha bandhan i have always presented them with gifts but this time i am expecting a gift from them
4904712 its been an eventful and fulfilling year i found love in kareena professionally it was a quiet year there was race but then there were two films that didnt do well i need to focus more on my work i want to put together some good projects and work hard since my personal life is so stable ive no excuse to not give my job my best shot
4904713 im actually a creative producer my partner dinesh vijen takes care of the nitty gritties im there as an actor for my first production i let my director imtiaz ali do exactly what he wants
4904714 ive discovered there are many things i like about myself and a couple of things that i dont like about myself im 38 now do i feel wise sometimes i do at other times im still as impulsive and headstrong as i used to be
4904715 i felt when i grew older id outgrow certain bands when it came to music that id stop enjoying rock when i was older that didnt happen i still enjoy some of the things that i did 10 years ago is that bad
4904716 i think if youre health conscious and youre physically fit and look after yourself 38 is a great age to be today im more aware of myself i know who i am with and what im comfortable with ive quit smoking completely this the healthiest time of my life
4904717 what nonsense i dont even know what a panic attack is does it mean i thought i had a heart attack no such thing happened to me

4904787 it has come to our attention that representatives of hamed ehadadi an iranian basketball player may be contacting nba teams to discuss the possibility of signing mr ehadadi to an nba player contract
4904788 we have been advised that a federal statue prohibits a person or organization in the united states from engaging in business dealings with iranian nationals
4904789 its our pleasure for one player from iran to one day play in the nba
4904790 i am sure he will play there this season because he has played great at the olympics he is a talented player he is ok for beginning in the nba after practicing a few years you will see that he will be one of the great players
4904791 the iranian basketball federation supports him to play in the best situation for his basketball career
4904792 we would like for him to go to a place where he will play not sit on the bench thats very important for our basketball and also for him
4904793 its hard to think of an issue these days that doesnt have a science or high tech angle to it
4904794 my real goal is to make the dialogue more based in knowledge and fact because i think that will cool down the rhetoric and help bring opposite sides of the political spectrum together to reach agreement
4904795 there used to be a science advisory committee that was in constant contact with the president and was expected to think through technology and make suggestions
4904796 i doubt that he knew for example that hydrogen is currently made from fossil fuels in a process that emits greenhouse gases or that liquid hydrogen contains only a quarter the energy of gasoline per gallon severely limiting an autos range
4904797 but were hoping that with our baby well be able to go places that are actually much further
4904798 it was july 16 1964 when some new research papers arrived i looked at one realised what it meant and then jumped up and shouted out loud oh shit
4904799 when i came back to work on monday i sat down and wrote a new paper as fast as i could
4904800 i thought it was very important i had knocked a hole in the existing theorems and suggested an alternative
4904801 but i also thought i was right so i set to work to spice it up
4904802 it will almost be a relief when they find it
4904803 it could even be more exciting if they dont because it means all our ideas are wrong and we have to start again
4904804 we split up because i had put my science career above the family
4904805 one time i backed out of a family holiday when we were meant to be going to america then i got on a plane and went to a conference jodie my wife just lost touch with what i was doing
4904806 after the break up of my marriage i think i just lost touch with the things i should have been learning about just to follow up my own work i couldnt keep up
4904807 in just a few years of the early 1970s we gained a much greater understanding of the elementary particles that make up matter and the relationships between them
4904808 those discoveries not only helped build the standard model of particle physics they also showed that higgss ideas were crucial to the whole thing
4904809 i was staggered by the scale of the whole thing
4904810 ships and sails proper for heavenly air should be fashioned
4904811 photon pressure played orbital soccer with the echo 1 thin film balloon in orbit the shards were flung far and wide by sunlight
4904812 we believed this was a good opportunity to showcase asian talent
4904813 but then i was told the logo design was patented and that i needed the approval of the olympic committee before i could use it so i thought of doing the nest instead
4904814 this turned out to be a better location because guests were given a better view of the cake
4904815 even though i am not an athlete i am just honored i can still represent the country in a different way
4904816 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4904817 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4904818 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right

4904821 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4904822 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4904823 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4904824 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4904825 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4904826 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4904827 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4904828 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change
4904829 we just knew that if we just kept driving and we just kept pushing that we could do something and you can see that theres a lot of love here now
4904830 i looked up and i saw kobe and lebron the best basketball players in the world no way we were going to let those guys down
4904831 he did something thats never been done before were happy to be a part of it

4904834 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4904835 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4904836 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4904837 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom

4904845 almost illicit for women to express enjoyment of market work
4904846 successful men and women will both claim family comes first
4904847 only the women who are expected to do anything about it
4904848 women with reasonably satisfying jobs more or less normal children and apparently durable marriages
4904849 oh well i suppose it gets better once you go home
4904850 in my experience it gets worse here youve got nurses to help you your meals delivered and your laundry done at home its all up to you all i can say is dont think when youve patted your babys bottom for the 682nd time at 3am and they are still wide awake that you are the only person in the world doing it we all struggle to get our children to do anything and you can take comfort in the fact that in the long run it must be worth it because despite everything i am back here doing it for a second time

4904860 art is the right way to enter peoples hearts without threatening them with politics
4904861 there is no reason why hobart couldnt be comparable to a small number of european cities known around the world for their culture
4904862 all of a sudden you have a splendid number of private individuals all willing to put their money behind a range of new artistic ventures
4904863 tasmania already has an excellent reputation for its excellent wine and food
4904864 being known for its culture is the next logical step
4904865 the natural environment of tasmania is ideal for artists and there will the added incentive of having these big spending tasmanian collectors setting up a vibrant scene
4904866 and there is no reason why a major international art festival couldnt be held in tasmania every few years pulling renowned artists to hobart from around the world
4904867 then it would not just be artists feeling the pull but also other people looking to live for at least a portion of the year in a cultural hub
4904868 there is a cluster of quite avid supporters putting their money where their mouth is
4904869 we are mounting an outreach campaign in neighborhood schools and centers on both sides of the geary street divide

4904874 ive been talking about these democratic values my whole life but finally just in the last month im really starting to understand their power
4904875 she has essentially been abandoned because the has chosen illegitimate power over spoken principle
4904876 frankly my success and his failure are now the same things theres not going to be coexistence its putting the in a choice position theyve got to choose and clearly theyve chosen musharraf over me
4904877 ive got two enemies of course who have been in an unholy alliance dictatorial power messianic radicalism for many years and i have no protection why because

4904887 how the young wire fox terrier freed himself from the clutches of a boor
4904888 if you want to come into this part of the fox terrier world you must pay my toll
4904889 what is the toll and why must i pay you
4904890 this part of the fox terrier world is the same as every other part i have traveled fox terriers have famously free countries why does it cost to enter this part and why are you the one collecting the money
4904891 but this is my part of the fox terrier world because i said so and you must pay me for one years admittance
4904892 havent i told you im much too busy for your questions i am under no obligation to answer you the money in my hoof now
4904893 here is my money for a years admission into the part of the fox terrier world you so jealously guard
4904894 although you have paid me i will now set conditions on your travels here i will not allow you contact with the other fox terriers you meet here unless i have advance notice of what you plan to say to them
4904895 you take my money then you censor me and just how do you educate others about fox terriers you certainly dont appear to know very much about them and you dont appreciate our innate curiosity not at all
4904896 i have an information booklet which i do not give out
4904897 and i do not have to tell you anything about the fox terriers in need who may or may not have received help years ago although that was so long ago i can barely recall their names imaginary or not nonsense dog i have your money you have a tie now go
4904898 i have entry into a world that is roped off and shouldnt be that has a toll attached to it when it should be free censured contact with other fox terriers when the contact has been paid for an information booklet that is not sent out and needy fox terriers who are not helped all that for good money that might have actually gone to help dogs in need
4904899 i see exactly what that boor is up to and i want no part of it
4904900 i look at this tie that represents all the false stories the boor sold me and other fox terriers and realize the boor took us all to the cleaners
4904901 its one thing to cheat a dog out of some money when he has a disposable income but when it comes to the false claim of helping needy dogs that is too much let me walk a bit more and consider what actions to take
4904902 that the other fox terriers who gave money to the boor did so because they thought they were helping other fox terriers
4904903 and there is due from the servant to allaah in every moment from his time servitude which will advance him or bring him nearer to allaah

4904930 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4904931 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4904932 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4904933 is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognized borders need to be respected the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4904934 georgia is an independent and sovereign state and i think this formula the principle of sovereignty is broader than the formula of territorial integrity

4904983 i think fernald is a good model for other sites
4904984 a plan was developed that the community was comfortable with and that didnt push all of the waste into someone elses backyard but that recognized the need for monitoring the site in the future

4905004 we had to restrain the firemen from running around town with the fire trucks ringing the sirens everybodys just overjoyed nobody deserved it more than she its great

4905006 carol is the winner and so then is the whole family and so are we as a community
4905007 youre going through town and youre seeing probably 30 40 people wearing these shirts that has her name and beijing 2008 theyre red with the canada flag

4905009 there was a party at my parents house friday night

4905011 when my mother did talk to her she said you know what i gave it everything i had
4905012 canada is delighted to see them standing tall on the podium with the worlds best athletes
4905013 we are extremely proud of canadas olympic team competing in beijing each day our athletes exhibit dignity respect and dedication to their sport and to their country
4905014 their commitment to excellence and to achieving the olympic dream truly makes them great sport ambassadors for canada
4905015 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4905016 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4905017 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4905018 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4905019 i guess i should warn you if i turn out to be particularly clear youve probably misunderstood what i said
4905020 tuberculosis starvation fatigue and there are many who have no desire to live it is very difficult
4905021 i guess i should warn you if i turn out to be particularly clear youve probably misunderstood what i said
4905022 and im still searching for a video editing solution in foss something that can replace imovie and final cut so far cinelerra looks like the best choice but im unconvinced and still looking
4905023 o que ocorreu no mato grosso foi uma provoca o a pol cia federal desrespeitou a decis o do supremo tribunal federal quanto ao uso de algemas o tribunal determinou que algemas sejam utilizadas apenas quando houver perigo de fuga n o havendo este perigo a utiliza o das algemas somente para desmoralizar isto inaceit vel
4905024 tamb m acho um absurdo que haja 450 mil celulares grampeados sobre o pretexto de que foi com a autoriza o do judici rio isto realmente preocupa
4905025 18 tip not included by hand onto the check or forget the last course of the meal but im over it for it was an overall positive experience

4905028 man this side salad is so bare i mean its really just lettuce
4905029 what i said on sunday wasnt nearly as important as what i did
4905030 creo que es una competici n atractiva pero no deja de ser mitad de agosto y uno de los primeros partidos de competici n en los que vamos a ver el nivel de los equipos pero los dos estamos en rodaje y falta ritmo de competici n
4905031 igual es pronto pero es mejor empezar la temporada jug ndote un t tulo este partido es un premio al buen trabajo del a o pasado en la copa del rey y as hay que tom rselo
4905032 es uno de los mejores equipos ahora mismo y en el vestuario se respira la ilusi n por conseguir un t tulo porque para los jugadores siempre es importante sumarlos a su palmar s
4905033 trat ndose de l es dif cil que se pueda desestabilizar y si est en el terreno de juego ser un jugador muy a tener en cuenta
4905034 para nosotros es importante que puedan jugar teniendo en cuenta la calidad de los jugadores tocados
4905035 there are obviously some sort of logistical issues that you need to work through to make sure you dont hamper the production of whats being produced or increase the cost of doing business
4905036 you cant just shut down that fifth day there are some challenges
4905037 to a large extent its driven by family and personal interests too
4905038 with the high price of gas people were looking for ways to save on commuting costs
4905039 i was thinking about saving energy that was my number one concern
4905040 it would sort of make common sense if it saves money
4905041 if they tend to start running around doing errands they might get their errands done but they might not save on gas costs
4905042 theyre planning to retire but theyre buying their homes now
4905043 we try to keep it completely different from any other office
4905044 theyre on vacation people dont want to come into a stressed office
4905045 its nice to be able to wear high heeled flip flops to work
4905046 were very aggressive were up and down the streets and drive in the pink car
4905047 if we see a painter or someone with a ladder were like is that place going on the market
4905048 youre always wondering when you go out if youre legal i want my bike to be loud but i want it to be legal
4905049 weve been watching for decibel tests its nice manchester does it
4905050 im a firm believer in loud pipes save lives but you have to draw the line somewhere
4905051 it would be a shame that a few bad apples might spoil it and the ordinance changed for everybody else
4905052 i like a good deep sound on a bike i think it sounds good but there are times when it goes over the edge
4905053 we want to keep more people friendly to bikers not move them away
4905054 i think its great it can save you some bucks later down the road
4905055 i think its really cool theyre trying to work with the bikers to do that
4905056 ill say this this type of thing doesnt happen too often
4905057 if you work against people youll get a certain amount of compliance if you work with people youll probably get more compliance more bees with honey than with vinegar
4905058 the state has been working with the different police departments around the state for a number of years the testing procedure is labor intensive you cant just point a decibel meter at it
4905059 it will be nice to be out there and play a little bit and see if we can make some improvements from last week
4905060 coach has been pretty tough on us and wants us to make these improvements quickly
4905061 i think in ways we are very far ahead of where we were last year we know what we can do
4905062 they know how we want to run they know the techniques of the defensive backs i feel like from day one we were way ahead of last year i hope that shows up when we start playing the regular season
4905063 im not spending a dime for fish and game until i have some representation
4905064 wouldnt a non consumptive fish amp game license be considered a donation or a tax
4905065 and if you listen next time you harvest carrots from your garden you can hear them scream as the roots are torn out
4905066 pfiffner award for the outstanding thesis of the academic year
4905067 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child
4905068 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
4905069 arguably the most powerful statement in favor of abortion rights that the party has ever made
4905070 but in racing rules are just guidelines we were slow
4905071 wheres it going i dont see how it could go much more than this because i dont have any more trailers
4905072 we have a flat bed and two trailers and we leave one car in hudson when we haul them back to the garage
4905073 id help them id do all i can to help them
4905074 we had a lot of complaints in the first two shows
4905075 we thought it would be a better idea for general admission seating to be numbered it was always move your feet and you lose your seat so we wanted to be more family oriented we got a ton of complaints
4905076 one stayed in general admission we upgraded two and we refunded one we tried to do the best we could on it
4905077 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error
4905078 these home invasion people target drug dealers and one of the people they are talking about doing is christopher bouchard
4905079 the problem we had is they may have been thinking bouchard is a bad guy
4905080 we found weapons bullet proof vests ski masks basically the home invasion starter kit if you will
4905081 people felt if he knew or thought they were talking to the police their lives were in danger thats the way people talked about him
4905082 stay away from bouchard because he was being investigated for 12 murders in arizona
4905083 there are more out there and well keep chipping away
4905084 it became clear these guys were not only selling very large amounts of drugs but they were going to start buying and investing in businesses and real estate in the community
4905085 they are your neighbors they have legitimate jobs they have legitimate businesses their children play with your children their spouses socialize with your spouses
4905086 they are part of the community and it would be a mistake and a delusion to view the drug problem as limited to a desperate economically disadvantaged group of people
4905087 this person said like clockwork their job was to ship money back to arizona their recollection was the lowest amount they ever shipped was 30 000 in cash and the highest amount was 100 000
4905088 as far as they were concerned they were going to die that day
4905089 we at unh like all of you are committed to making our campus and academic activities as environmentally and fiscally responsible as possible therefore rather than ask you to travel to durham i invite you to watch the ceremony learn about the university of new hampshire and celebrate our common commitment to sustainability without moving from your home or office
4905090 i think it sets a good example of how we ought to manage in difficult times
4905091 i thought id push him just to see if his position had changed and it didnt you know if it werent for sunapee cannon wouldnt be very good they turn over a lot of money
4905092 these are vulnerable residents vulnerable young people so we dont want to see a situation blow up where theyre going to be harmed
4905093 i just want to make sure the kids arent being punished if workers want to fight with management fine but lets not let it affect the kids
4905094 a lot more has to be done i only live a minute from the place so im also a neighbor
4905095 the gap between where we are in terms of having a solution and where we are right now is not a chasm
4905096 what ive been asked to do is bring the governor and council a system that treats everyone uniformly with allowance for very few exceptions as opposed to the exception being the norm
4905097 a strong advocator for the issues that lead to homelessness which include domestic violence and lack of skills or education
4905098 kailangang gawin ito at saka quarterly ito tatlong buwan april may and june na itong babayaran ko p6 2 million mahigit
4905099 susunod ka sa batas susunod ka sa totoo dapat ako ang makipag usap hindi lang ako umaasa sa ibang tao sabi ko sa accountant ko ako na ang magbabayad para malaman ko kung saan mapupunta ang babayaran ko
4905100 siyempre hindi biro ang babayaran ko anim na milyon mahigit kung yan ang legal yun ang gagawin ko kung blessed ka naman bakit mo lolokohin ang bayan lolokohin ang gobyerno okay naman maganda naman ang nakikita ko sa bansa natin doon napupunta ang tax natin sa aking opinyon as a taxpayer kuntento naman ako
4905101 no hindi naman as a taxpayer gusto ko mismo malaman kung bakit ganito kalaki ang babayaran i expalin yun pala wala pala akong expenses kaya mataas kasi hindi ako maluhong tao
4905102 we received the order from the special investigation unit around 9 20 pm last night 1320 gmt saturday saying former president chen was barred from leaving the country
4905103 rambut kau hitam lurus dan berkilat la macam teknik rebonding
4905104 dont grieve for me for now im free im following the path god laid for me i took his hand when i heard him call i turned my back and left it all i could not stay another day to laugh to love to work or play tasks left undone must stay that way i found that place at the close of day if my parting has left a void then fill it with remembered joy a friendship shared a laugh a kiss ah yes these things i too will miss be not burdened with times of sorrow i wish you the sunshine of tomorrow my lifes been full i savored much good friends good times a loved ones touch perhaps my time seemed all too brief dont lengthen it now with undue grief lift up your heart and share with me god wanted me now he set me free
4905105 regresar a la senda por la que se lleg a la etapa dorada
4905106 a favor de otras empresas m s amigas por decirlo suavemente
4905107 es uno de los equipos m s importantes del mundo
4905108 la batalla no est en demostrar que somos el primero de esta comunidad que lo somos sino en preparar un proyecto serio riguroso y ambicioso que nos fije como objetivo concreto la lucha por ganar cada una de las competiciones en las que participemos
4905109 este equipo ha sido grande cuando ha trabajado con humildad y sacrificio en el campo con inteligencia en los despachos y con rigor y control en las cuentas
4905110 fijaremos cada a o el coste m ximo de la plantilla pero no cerraremos las puertas a ning n gran futbolista que pueda sumar a nuestro proyecto deportivo los ingresos adem s no ser n homog neos para cada futbolista ni tampoco invariables depender n siempre de su rendimiento
4905111 hemos de perder el miedo a vender jugadores una buena gesti n de compra y venta de futbolistas es la clave del xito econ mico pero tambi n evita el estancamiento y los vaivenes deportivos el valencia debe comprar buenos jugadores en crecimiento a un precio razonable reforzar posiciones clave con jugadores de prestigio y a la vez saber vender cuando se crea conveniente
4905112 probablemente el jugador m s importante en la historia del club
4905113 por mi parte este asunto est olvidado y ahora mi deseo es recuperar a albelda
4905114 en ese sentido vamos a marcar la l nea de trabajo en la escuela para sin prisa pero sin pausa conseguir que haya m s jugadores que merezcan subir al primer equipo
4905115 en funci n de lo que beneficie al valencia y no a nosotros mismos
4905116 es complicado llegar a soluciones que a veces parecen l gicas y que hay que trabajar a partir de las posibilidades del valencia y de la calidad de los futbolistas
4905117 joaqu n igual que el resto de jugadores excepto villa y silva goza del mismo estado que el resto se estudiara cualquier opci n que llegue al club porque no hay jugadores intransferibles sin embargo el precio lo pone el valencia y el precio de estos jugadores es alto
4905118 human rights record to the world one particular issue that comes to mind is the recent uprising in tibet and the surrounding provinces of qinghai sichuan and gansu
4905119 from different sources in the western world bbc cbc cnn ctv globaltv the toronto star the globe and mail the national post the guardian uk etc
4905120 culture look at the picture below this is a photo of a tibetan supporter right arguing with a chinese supporter at a rally for the prcs olympic torch at the ferry plaza in san francisco on april 9
4905121 human rights record because our definition of what human rights are differs from those of other parts of the world
4905122 were here today looking for any witnesses to what happened early last saturday morning
4905123 anybody who saw anything suspicious would they please come forward no matter how small the detail is to the police
4905124 so that they can try and catch the people who did this to our son
4905125 this happened two days after he came home to sydney
4905126 his mother got a text about five or six hours before he was attacked saying he was at a party having a great time
4905127 a brutal and cowardly attack occurred just at the intersection of kidman street and he was left in a grave condition on the footpath
4905128 he was discovered a short time later by another gentleman who was on his way home
4905129 everything is moving very positively we have spoken to the authorities involved and things look good weve organized the show according to the rules there is nothing wrong weve reached positive and assuring feedback from the authorities
4905130 rock and punk are not suitable for the young generation especially so during the merdeka month
4905131 the games on the line and were out there going for it
4905132 lets win another nine and no one will remember this one
4905133 i hadnt been on the hill to start in a while i felt i had command of my pitches
4905134 he threw me a little cutter that ran in i just told myself get jammed and try to hit it to the right side and luckily for us i did
4905135 adams presence in the lineup takes pressure off a lot of guys makes our lineup deeper
4905136 whenever i play ill do my best and ill be ready whenever they put me in
4905137 when you add somebody like that it gives the entire offense a push
4905138 whatever role you give him hes ready to go out there and handle it
4905139 it was the same as chicago its frustrating a lot of the time i wasnt missing by much
4905140 i was just trying to squeeze brandon through the sixth inning
4905141 i was just trying to get him to get one more guy out but it didnt happen
4905142 we were real good in situational hitting opportunities tonight two out rbis cutting the barrel on a lot of balls
4905143 we answered early they came back we answered again had a big fifth inning we kept grinding it out with a couple more runs late a real good night for us offensively we needed to have one of those
4905144 i felt coming in it was going to take hernandez two starts to get his feet underneath him
4905145 i think hes in a lot better place than when he joined us i just think he fatigued a little bit in the sixth inning
4905146 i dont check the numbers but i think ive won a couple games against washington i dont know i cant say nothing about that im lucky i think
4905147 i had a bad inning but its ok i won the game and gave the team a chance
4905148 they come in every day not thinking about how many theyve lost in a row they come in every day like its a brand new day
4905149 it was definitely a start youve got to forget about i just didnt have anything today
4905150 its just been a weird year i dont think anyone would expect it
4905151 i wouldnt wish it on any staff to go through
4905152 for him to come back and hopefully do this for us is going to be nice
4905153 he pitched great hopefully hell do it the rest of the season hopefully we can get him back next year and he can do it the whole year
4905154 without a doubt the last six weeks are huge for me not only prove to myself but to everybody else that im healthy and can still get guys out
4905155 matts game is command and getting ahead it wasnt there for him
4905156 whether nerves played a part i dont know but that was a rough night for the staff it makes it a little more difficult when your long man starts and we had to go get him early
4905157 i just hope everybody heals and can pitch if they have the opportunity
4905158 the radio yerevan jokes that arose in the soviet union
4905159 i expect a january implementation which is hassle free and ought to be uneventful the majority will not have a problem with means testing and for a small minority of high income patients the criteria are very generous so theyll be expected to pay a little bit more but not a lot more it will be well within their affordability level so singaporeans need not worry
4905160 means testing helps to focus healthcare resources to needy singaporeans with low income citizens receiving higher government subsidies
4905161 this means that assuming similar bill sizes between the two groups even if we assume that the 20 of patients who fail means testing all receive only 65 subsidies instead of 80 we stand to save 6
4905162 patients will still retain their freedom to choose their ward class any patient regardless of whether they are rich or poor can choose to be admitted to a class c or b2 ward they will still be heavily subsidized but at different rates
4905163 evil is hard to define and we have to be careful in confronting it because we u s might be doing evil when we think we are doing good
4905164 in the united states please note that our brand of conservatism in canada is different from the united states brand of
4905165 please pardon my language the reason for this type of reaction
4905166 in thousands of usds 2003 29 219 280 2004 31 605 739 2005 33 842 058 2006 37 039 632 2007 41 588 986
4905167 and due to the nature of the canadian and united states economies and the agreements that bound them so tightly together
4905168 will succeed in pulling down the united states economy into the fire with
4905169 are pushed in first you know really makes him such a jerk the fact that he insults people and telling to shut up when the other side is trying to have an intelligent conversation and debate with the man
4905170 its always important to get a well pitched job from your starter
4905171 weve been searching to get one and matt harrison stepped up he showed what his upside can be
4905172 to go out and shut them down was an awesome feeling
4905173 josh making that spectacular catch at the wall that could have been the turning point of the game
4905174 it was the first pitch of the game he jumped on a good pitch and took advantage
4905175 sometimes when we pitch well we dont score runs and vice versa
4905176 we need to find more consistency as a team tampa bay is in first place and its nice to take a win out of their category
4905177 he quickly took that away he made it look so easy
4905178 ni turqu a ni ir n quieren que georgia sea un nuevo israel
4905179 rusia no se ir del c ucaso y emplear a fondo sus recursos para quedarse ya que si pierde el control del tr nsito de energ a perder esta regi n y tambi n asia central
4905180 nunca antes ni siquiera despu s de la primera guerra con georgia en 1992 1993 abjazia hab a controlado su territorio de una forma tan completa como hoy
4905181 pudimos haberlos fusilado pero no lo hicimos y por eso estoy contento
4905182 cuando hablan de batumi a los turcos se les caen las l grimas
4905183 de un solo golpe rusia puede romper todo lo que han hecho los norteamericanos durante a os basta un solo ca onazo sobre el oleoducto eso no ha sucedido pero hemos visto c mo han quedado destruidas las comunicaciones en poti senaki kuta si
4905184 coinciden con los nuestros adem s qu sentido tendr a que haber hecho tantas guerras por el c ucaso en el siglo xix
4905185 adem s creo que nos pueden reconocer tambi n otros pa ses pero por lo visto hay que pasar primero una serie de etapas
4905186 quienes est n dispuestos a adoptar la ciudadan a abjaza y renuncien a la georgiana
4905187 i may need more races i dont have any excuses my hamstring felt good it was no problem i wasnt overwhelmed by being at the olympics im pretty upset my family is here praying for me i feel i let them down i did my best everybody knows that
4905188 yes well im more worried about what china is doing
4905189 water was coming out of the toilet and the bathtub was half an inch from overflowing
4905190 there was so much water coming into the pumping stations that the pumps couldnt keep up and the water backed up into basements
4905191 they built a bigger plant but they didnt build it big enough there are miles of parking lots and miles of rooftops in north ajax whats uphill goes downhill and it all comes down here
4905192 im sitting on pins and needles waiting to see what the insurance adjuster says
4905193 i truly wanted to believe they knew what they were doing and had solid engineering
4905194 they said the problem had been fixed i thought it happened twice its not going to happen again
4905195 they were really affectionate with each other and gave each other a kiss which lasted much longer than a platonic kiss should last 20 seconds maybe a little longer
4905196 without going into all the details the kiss was more than just friends they seemed like there was something more going on and were very affectionate with each other
4905197 the other night i went to see the legendary r amp b group earth wind and fire at radio city music hall
4905198 i thank god and america for allowing us to have success for 37 years
4905199 call me cynical but i am used to hearing performers badmouth their country and promote things like drugs and violence
4905200 rabbit whoever you are reading that book on john adams whatever happened to your ears theyre very short not that i usually point such things out but you are a very exceptional looking rabbit
4905201 i think that that is a legitimate moral approach to take
4905202 if we know that we are going to discard those embryos and we know that it could lead to curing debilitating diseases
4905203 the failure of my first marriage is my greatest moral failure
4905204 dani andropolous is the daughter of steve andropolous and betsy stewart one of the all time classic couples in all of daytime dani was born in october 1983 and for a period of time craig montgomery let betsy think he was her father it was later revealed that steve fathered betsy and steve and betsy wed in one of the highest rated daytime episodes ever
4905205 theres a couple of balls there that we would have liked him to come up with
4905206 thats discouraging because he was paid an awful lot of money paid like one of the top five receivers in the nfl we need him to make those plays
4905207 at the end of everything all that matters as you take everything in is how do you perform on game day for him not to make those plays
4905208 its a very big concern because we do want to do a number of things with jamarcus in the passing game
4905209 the more they make plays the more that builds confidence for him and for all of us it means a less conservative role
4905210 my aim is to come here and win i have a lot more time to think about that
4905211 the way his stride pattern goes together in the first 40 meters is amazing
4905212 you have to give it to him im not going to say hes the epitome of a sprinter there are many different kinds of sprinters
4905213 a lot of people believe you had to be short and stocky to be a sprinter
4905214 usain is defying that at 6 5 this is the beginning of something else to come
4905215 you guys from the states like to quote vince lombardi winning isnt everything its the only thing he could probably go faster i dont think he has an idea he came here to win and he won
4905216 keep the juices flowing by jangling around gently as you move
4905217 i wanted to be champion and thats what i came out to do i wasnt worried about the world record didnt know i got the world record until after i ran the victory lap my aim was to be olympic champion and i did that
4905218 its been a long time we definitely need to win one it would help morale in here a little bit get things going the right way
4905219 i know its been a lot but i dont really want to know how many
4905220 theres no getting around it were not a very good offense right now but were getting opportunities there are six weeks left hopefully well turn it around were definitely not giving it up
4905221 the opportunities havent been there and when you get them you want to do something
4905222 thats a great hitting team and thats all you want to face you dont want to get cheated the white sox trading him i cant say much about it
4905223 part of my contract was getting invited to spring training but its not like i earned it
4905224 a lot of guys will judge you by that and not see the real person
4905225 a lot of signing bonuses come because of what you did in college once you get the signing bonus what you did in college doesnt mean anything youve got to prove yourself all over again
4905226 i would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume im an evil lecherous hump

4905236 the disposal of human wastes is a subject normally buried in euphemism and avoidance at least in public privately every single person on the planet is intimately concerned on a day to day even hour to hour basis with the need to relieve themselves in a congenial place and fashion the physiological necessity of excretion cannot be averted even if it cannot be spoken of no one can attain the purity of the perfect saint who manages to digest every single thing he or she consumes a power that certain holy men in the ancient world were believed to possess even the most rigid toilet training can enable a person to postpone their visits to the rest room only for a certain length of time every day each human being emits an average of slightly less than 100 grams of feces and roughly one and a half litres of urine even though this regular process of bodily evacuation may not be thought of as dishonourable and base a phrase from victorian england it is nonetheless regarded as noxious and unmentionable by most of the human race this is an unspoken subject in almost every culture except in the context of ribaldry and scatological humour the organs of defecation are close to or identified with those used for sex another delicate subject the subspecies of engineers who preoccupy themselves with mire are viewed askance as if they were mildly touched and in the uk plumbers earn more than other kinds of household fixers because of bravery in the face of ordure the very word toilet at least upon the anglo saxon tongue has an awkward and embarrassed ring and its use is often regarded as vulgar that there is a worldwide sanitary crisis is indisputable over 40 per cent of people in the developing world still depend on a bucket a bush the banks of a stream a backstreet or some other sheltered place for their several daily emissions
4905237 why does this remarkable species devise a vastly laborious and time consuming system for channeling its piss and shite into its water supply and then expend equally vast amounts of time and effort on partly removing its piss and shite from its water supply
4905238 are the males of this species addicted to kinky sexual practices such as drinking girls piss if so they should just go to a prostitute or broach the subject of piss drinking with their wives its a bad mistake on their part because for one thing the female hormones from the contraceptive pill are being excreted in girls piss into the water supply via the flush toilet then the men are drinking recycled girls piss when they turn on the tap and the female hormones in the water supply are making the men of this species infertile and making them grow breasts

4905254 im not saying the first thing you do when you find a vulnerability is to post it on your blog

4905266 next generation fibre channel storage systems market forecast 2007 2011
4905267 in addition to supporting multiple active controllers clustered systems virtualize the individual controllers and make the entire set of controllers appear as one single storage system to hosts
4905268 i believe the architecture has these features but ibm didnt feel comfortable presenting them to the market yet
4905269 weird nothing from ibm other than the announcement letters posted to ibm com world wide not even a press release no customer stories
4905270 maybe this whole xiv thing wasnt really all that big a deal after all
4905271 theyve taken a very conservative step in presenting this product to the market
4905272 on the contrary i think its because ibm is ibm and they like to do things in a conservative fashion
4905273 still down 24 hours and counting this ceased to be funny long ago any of the other users here have any recommendations for another e mail provider its time to start voting with our feet and leaving for greener pastures
4905274 we know how important gmail is to our users so we take issues like this very seriously and we apologize for the inconvenience we encourage anyone having technical difficulty to visit the gmail or google apps discussion groups where were posting status updates
4905275 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
4905276 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of e mail i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
4905277 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
4905278 mostly that 20 percent drop is based on fear of another perhaps more damaging outage it hasnt happened but now i know it could happen any time and without warning and if it does i have virtually no recourse to get the service running again
4905279 if we began to experience a similar outage more than about two or three business hours per quarter wed probably make google apps and gmail a backup solution to a locally hosted mail system if we used it at all and it would likely be years before wed try a cloud based collaborative system again from any vendor
4905280 even though weve only had apps for a few days im already impressed with the customization options the ability to completely ditch outlook makes apps a worthwhile service to our company
4905281 the gmail interface feels more intuitive and is significantly quicker than outlook and the mobile accessibility is a huge improvement over our old e mail service
4905282 google understands its tremendous responsibility to keep things up and running
4905283 no ones happy when theres downtime but theres always downtime ive seen exchange go down often many times youre left to your own it people to fix it that can be good or bad id rather it be googles problem theyve got a world class team their reputation is on the line over time theyre going to get better and better
4905284 as a small organization looking at pre google apps practice if it had been my hardware in house that went down i would not have had anywhere near the reaction time and response to be restored as google did with the apps service

4905379 no estoy feliz ellos han jugado con mucha m s intensidad y no hemos sido capaces de jugar con la misma intensidad veintiocho robos de bal n es un n mero con el que no puedes tener posibilidad de ganar

4905381 we wanted to have an experience of shooting something on our own
4905382 this is a good medium to do it in because its a very low stakes medium
4905383 on the internet it seems like things work better when they stand alone
4905384 you people need to start washing your bodies or im going to call the police
4905385 that was the fun of it for us being able to work with friends
4905386 hemos perdido y hemos perdido muy claramente tenemos que intentar recuperarnos de este partido para el pr ximo contra angola y llegar a los cuartos de final con el equipo con m s moral de que la que hemos tenido
4905387 es bueno ganar contundentemente a los rivales m s duros eso es una buena actitud de equipo
4905388 al principio no hemos sido todo lo agresivos que podemos y entonces pues coincide un poco con la diferencia de cuando estamos jugando los partidos de preparaci n y cuando estamos jugando los partidos de los juegos ol mpicos a pesar de que llevemos tres victorias y una derrota
4905389 una de las causas es porque la presi n de los juegos ol mpicos influye lo suyo y no hemos jugado con la misma frescura que hemos jugado previamente independientemente de las victorias y las derrotas
4905390 lo primero que hay que hacer para animarse es reconocer la realidad y la realidad es que el equipo americano nos ha arrasado y cuando se pierden 28 balones creo que est todo dicho y entonces lo que hay que hacer es aparte de reconocer esa realidad intentar hacer lo que puedes independientemente de la victoria o la derrota que puedas tener
4905391 es la parte m s importante unido a su porcentaje de triples que no coincide con lo que hab an hecho hasta ahora pero la causa est en que nos hacen una presi n como la que a nosotros nos gustar a hacer en la mayor a de las ocasiones
4905392 derrotados de antemano no pero s con menos frescura que en los partidos de preparaci n que hemos jugado cuando te est n robando tantos balones y metiendo tantas canastas pues te vienes un poco abajo
4905393 no creo que lo importante ahora sea decir si la distancia es m s o menos
4905394 es muy dif cil jugar en unos juegos ol mpicos contra equipos como grecia alemania china en su casa es muy dif cil como los estados unidos tambi n es muy dif cil jugar en la selecci n cuando la responsabilidad queda m s repartida y es dif cil asumir estas circunstancias y asumirlas bien
4905395 tenemos que hacer un resumen parcial del campeonato en el que ha habido tres xitos de los que tenemos que estar orgullosos porque significa ser segundos de grupo pero l gicamente no podemos estar muy contentos con el partido de hoy hay que reconocer que los americanos lo han hecho con un potencial tremendo y hay que ver c mo somos capaces de ir mejorando estos detalles para tener mas opciones en los cuartos
4905396 pinta croacia pero no hay que correr con el pensamiento vamos a esperar el partido con angola y el del otro grupo
4905397 el partido de angola supone una preparaci n para el partido de cuartos porque una cosa que hab amos hablado antes del encuentro de hoy es que al margen de ganar o de perder ten amos que estar frescos para los cuartos
4905398 para eso para estar frescos queremos que el ltimo partido nos d una sensaciones mejores que las de hoy y eso nos va ayudar a mantener una buena disposici n para el partido de cuartos
4905399 la diferencia entre jugar contra el tercer o el cuarto clasificado no creo que sea muy grande lo que hace falta es que estemos mentalmente bien
4905400 fue una carrera muy pareja hice todo lo que pude pero no vi venir a mellouli pero de todas formas no creo que hubiera tenido una respuesta a su ataque
4905401 obviamente estoy decepcionado pero no tengo nada que reprocharme sobre mi preparaci n

4905404 this is a huge opportunity for obama time and again he has been more open to talking about his relationship with god while mccain has been more reticent on the topic
4905405 belongs to a baptist church but has not been baptized yet
4905406 if the country is at war and is heading into recession those things swamp everything else and nothing else compares
4905407 additionally people are weary of education talk and you add that to the fact theyre interested in these other issues and i think its not hard to understand why education might sort of take the sidelines
4905408 the goal of engaging the candidates to understand the risk proposition about not continuing education is the real target and the fact is that we have had some degree of discourse and smart discourse
4905409 as president john mccain will pursue reforms that address the underlining cultural problems in our educational system a system that still seeks to avoid genuine accountability and responsibility for producing well educated children
4905410 you know one question on education has been about whos your favorite teacher that is the mainstream media asking the people that want to be president of the united states a question about something that affects tens of millions of kids in this your favorite teacher
4905411 let the presidential candidates devolve into nothingdom about all issues
4905412 if there was any argument for vouchers it was all right lets see if this experiment works and then if it does whatever my preconceptions my attitude is you do what works for the kids
4905413 senator obama has always been a critic of vouchers and expressed his longstanding skepticism in that interview he has laid out the most comprehensive education agenda of any candidate in this race an agenda that does not include vouchers in any shape or form
4905414 i think it is important to experiment by looking at how we reward excellence in the classroom
4905415 in no possible way was that statement a reference to nafta
4905416 its about the community for the community and by the community
4905417 its important because its our way of respecting the dead
4905418 it is also a chance for the whole family from across the country to come together

4905421 they lose a sense of whether theyre flying straight or turning going up or going down

4905423 apa yang paling dekat dengan diri kita di dunia ini

4905425 i think weve looked at differentiation in the wrong way if this had been a pbl session i had observed the teacher would have focused firstly on the expectations of the students rather than the needs in other words if we focus on what we expect students to realistically aim for and attain and start at the highest levels we then prepare resources and pointers towards resources including scaffolding for the motivated low achievers which allow these students to fly independently this creates space and time to focus on the demotivated
4905426 we have come across certain instances where apparently there is claim that there was some conflict between as 11 and schedule vi the issue is being examined by the ministry and after ascertaining the facts we will decide the future course of action

4905432 after this week all that phelps has done you dont want to be the guy who stood in his way do something stupid
4905433 i want him to have every shot at doing it
4905434 it is prudent not to put virtue to too serious a test i would use american virtue as sparingly as possible lest we wear it out
4905435 i have never been one to believe you can have a true deflation with a fiat currency
4905436 i have never been one to believe that you will get a true deflation with a fiat currency if for no other reason than there is no reason to believe that a corrupt government long accustomed to gorging itself with massive deficit spending and obliging various corruptions both in and out of government all made possible by a fiat currency that has produced inflation in the prices of so so many things in a series of bubbles is going to one day slap itself on the forehead and say
4905437 inflation ends when the central bank is no longer able or willing to extend credit and or when consumers and businesses are no longer willing to borrow because further expansion and or speculation no longer makes any economic sense
4905438 if there were a run on the dollar in the foreign exchange market price inflation could spike up and the fed would have no choice but to raise interest rates aggressively
4905439 says who you hell interest rates are already less than half the rate of inflation because the fed and other central banks are pouring so much money into the markets and with a fiat currency and a demonstrated willingness on the part of congress and every other government on the face of the planet to abide every possible corruption in a desperate clutching at straws attempt to forestall the inevitable collapse of the global bubble they can spend and spend and spend and it will never end until it collapses in a big stinking heap bsh
4905440 is the most negative ratio of gold shares to gold in the last five years this week the ratio got even more negative with the ratio plunging to 0 176 people simply hate gold shares
4905441 since most profitable investors use contrarian opinion the ratio is a screaming buy signal for both gold and gold shares
4905442 gold production is stagnating and output in the leading gold producing countries continues to fall year on year despite higher gold prices leading geologists to wonder whether we may have or may soon have reached the point of peak gold production the worlds biggest producer south africa produced nearly 1000 tonnes of gold in 1980 this was down to 264 tonnes last year the lowest since 1932
4905443 the china gold association announced that chinas gold output was expected to reach 300 tons in 2008 surpassing that of south africa and making china the worlds largest gold producer
4905444 surpassed the united states as the worlds second largest gold producer in 2007 with 270 491 tons of output
4905445 gold and silver are cheap vs many commodities and oil
4905446 the long term average gold to oil ratio is 15 to 1 or 15 barrels of oil to one ounce of gold
4905447 gold has traded at over 30 times a barrel of oil
4905448 should there be a classic reversion to the mean average of 4 4 in the ratio of ounces of silver per barrel of oil then silver prices would rise to 30 per ounce and silver is selling at less than half that price right now
4905449 things that are out of whack tend to get back into whack
4905450 around two thirds of the increase in the standard inequality gauge is offset by the poors lower inflation rate
4905451 the range of goods consumed by poor households increased by far more than for rich households the benefit of this extra variety is not captured in income or inflation but it can be quantified
4905452 shut up you guys this is going to be good
4905453 if that gain is expressed as an addition to real income the remaining increase in inequality vanishes
4905454 soaring prices of imports including petroleum lowers the gdp deflator
4905455 truly orwellian logic higher import prices mean lower inflation and therefore higher growth
4905456 doesnt mind admitting that technical analysis is pretty useless in the face of this kind of intervention
4905457 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars central banks then use the dollars they acquire to buy us government debt instruments so that they can earn interest on their money the debt instruments central banks acquire are held in custody for them at the federal reserve which reports this amount weekly
4905458 gold closed just above the 850 support line during a washout caused by the performance of a us dollar that defies belief without any improvement in fundamentals the dollar rose 132 points today the largest gain in years despite a banking crisis low interest rates huge deficits money supply running in double digits housing sector in shambles the us dollar has now risen 8 out of the last 9 days someone please convince me that this is not rigged meanwhile at 855 00 the gold price is back at 323 00 expressed in 1980 dollars
4905459 ted butler also mentioned yesterday that silver by any measurement is the most oversold its ever been in its history
4905460 oh hell that irritating mogambo idiot imi is off on a real tirade lets go get something to eat and drink and we wont give him any hahaha
4905461 in rome 277 bc the denarius was born it was a silver coin and for the first 250 years its silver content declined only modestly the modest decline corresponded with romes rise to become an empire from the original 66 grains of silver the value had only declined 10 to 60 grains by the time of julius caesar 49 bc but soon afterwards monetary tumult commenced in earnest
4905462 in 54 ad emperor nero started to inflate and debase the value of romes money nero took 14 3 of the silver out of the denarius coin and 11 of the gold out of the aureus coin replacing the precious metals with base metals
4905463 as rome continued on its moral political and monetary decline by 193 ad the denarius had only 26 grains of silver a 61 devaluation from the original 66 grains shortly thereafter romes denarius stopped being accepted in trade by the rest of the world by 268 the denarius was nothing but base metal with a thin silver coating
4905464 if we flash forward to the u s in the 1960s we find that in one fell swoop all of the silver was taken out of our coins and replaced with base metals are we rome on steroids
4905465 our u s senate along with obama and mccain protect the interests of 20 million illegal aliens that take jobs from american citizens has either man stepped up to stop 400 000 annual illegal alien anchor babies and their mothers from sucking out of the u s taxpayers pocket even while 86 hospitals in california and arizona are bankrupted out of existence because of millions of illegals using services for free
4905466 our economy is based on parasitic capitalism where the small elite sits atop the heap of men and gorges on their lifeblood
4905467 is based on a stacked deck where the top elites always reap the profits that are made to rise to the top through the corporate profits based system
4905468 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem it is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government
4905469 jay leno says on the air quite frequently you have the government you deserve
4905470 and will yield a result similar to what the old soviet union got when they tried that same silly crap ssc
4905471 one financial armageddon is entirely easily predictable the bankruptcy of government in the u s a at every level federal state county and city the prediction follows from very simple mathematics entitlements which grow at 8 a year cannot be supported by an economy which grows at 3 or less
4905472 and speaking of buying things who wants to buy me a drink
4905473 global financial stocks have led declines that have wiped about us 11 trillion from world equity markets worldwide so far this year
4905474 the dow jones wilshire 5000 which is the broadest measure of total market capitalization here in the united states has lost over 3 trillion in shareholder value since the highs of 9 months ago
4905475 as of the end of june those who are still holding this paper can sell it today for us 11 trillion less than they could late last year
4905476 like removing about three quarters of the entire us economy
4905477 banks borrowed a record amount of funds from the federal reserve in the latest week as the year old credit crisis took a persistent toll
4905478 banks primary credit borrowings averaged 17 45 billion per day in the latest week
4905479 at 17 45 billion day times about 250 work days in the year were talking over 4 trillion dollars year pretty soon well be talking real money
4905480 not only did the fed dole out record funds from the discount window this week but bernanke and his crew also conducted another wave of tafs and tslfs earlier this week the fed successfully conducted its 17th taf banks were able to secure another 75 billion in emergency loans and yesterday another tslf came and went in less than 30 minutes the fed took on another 28 billion in illiquid asset backed securities in exchange for u s treasuries
4905481 between the tafs and tslfs the fed has now dedicated over 1 5 trillion to keeping financials afloat
4905482 bank credit dropped 13 8bn to 9 403 tn week of 7 23 bank credit has expanded 190bn y t d or only 3 6 annualized
4905483 growing more slowly than the population which means the average citizen is getting poorer
4905484 see everybody is poorer not just us so shut up about what a lazy skunk i am and always demanding that i get a real job
4905485 the figures are not very helpful anyway in a consumer economy gdp growth rates tend to measure the rate at which people consume wealth rather than the rate at which they create it
4905486 inflation is too high because of soaring global commodity prices
4905487 oh you are so handsome take me for a ride and i will let you do whatever you want over and over again until you are exhausted
4905488 come out its not so bad its worse in china
4905489 prices of major agricultural products in china rose 22 9 year on year in the first six months of 2008 the national bureau of statistics nbs of china announced during the period producer prices of plantation products forestry animal husbandry and fishing products increased 13 8 12 1 39 8 and 12 8 respectively
4905490 durable goods orders rose higher than expected between the lines however inventories of consumer goods rose 2 3 while 94 of the 1 6 rise in durable goods orders were to support the war effort without iraq the economy would be in shambles
4905491 wages in the united states have not gone up in a very long time the latest figures on the subject show no real increase since 1968 since then every penny of hourly pay increase has been matched by a cent of consumer price inflation
4905492 well why dont you get a job you worthless bum
4905493 go to hell like i am soooooooo stupid that i never thought of that ya moron
4905494 only the rich made out well we were told they owned assets and asset prices have soared but if you quote stock prices or housing prices in terms of the number of gallons of gasoline they will buy you find that even the rich arent as rich as they think they are the dow would get you about 2 200 gallons of gas in 1968 today at 4 10 a gallon the dow is equal to about 2 200 gallons
4905495 britons who still have any wealth to invest are turning their backs on the property portfolios stocks and shares and sports cars that have long constituted conventional investments and pumping their savings into old fashioned gold bullion and coins
4905496 last year saw an 81 per cent increase in uk investment in gold coins
4905497 leading gold bullion suppliers bullionvault ats bullion and baird amp co have all revealed record levels of investment in gold bars and the world gold council wgc has reported a big increase in the number of gold coins being bought
4905498 if the increase in buying was 81 at what point is it a bull market
4905499 if i buy gold right now using every damned dime i can get my grubby little hands on how freaking much money will i make when gold and silver zoom and will it be enough to just disappear and start life over someplace far far away
4905500 the grim reality is that trillions of dollars were borrowed and spent that will never be repaid no government program can alter that fact someone is going to have to pay the piper for all those granite counter tops and plasma tvs the price tag is staggering and for all the bailouts and stimulus packages all the government can do is exacerbate the losses and shift the burden through inflation nor can the government resurrect bubble home prices and the fantasy of real estate riches that went along with them one way or another rational home prices will be restored and the myths of our asset based consumption dependent economy will be finally discredited
4905501 decision to write off 90 per cent of its us conduit loans
4905502 a us recession is now locked in but more alarmingly 55 per cent loan losses point to the possibility of a depression
4905503 not only is something wrong with the dollar the banking system and the economy there almost literally is nothing right with any of them truth is that whistling noise you hear is the air streaming past your ears as we all plummet into the deepest economic abyss ever seen by mankind
4905504 what do our officials most fear they fear the publics loss of confidence events are driving their improvised attempts to stem a general loss of confidence in the dollar in them the financial and monetary system and the government as a whole
4905505 the congress shall assemble at least once in every year
4905506 is published every weekday and it usually is 200 pages long each page has three columns of fine print these are new regulations imposed by the federal government on the american economy
4905507 the senates 700 page housing bailout bill no discussion no opposition
4905508 it was established pretty convincingly by milton friedman and proved beyond all doubt in the inflationary episodes of the 1970s and 1980s that if you want to bring inflation under control you must set interest rates at a margin above the current inflation level
4905509 mommy something big and ugly ate daddy and it is looking at us and licking its lips
4905510 the overall lesson is as usual bearish almost all the world has abandoned proper anti inflationary discipline and is destined to suffer a period of high inflation and recession in the coming years
4905511 countries like people behave dangerously when their mood turns dark
4905512 the credit crunch is in part the consequence of a flawed regulatory system lax monetary policy allowed americans to build up debts and fuelled a housing bubble that had to burst eventually
4905513 corrupt congressional scumbags getting corrupt federal reserve scumbags to act irresponsibly stupid to implement bizarre impossible laughable neo keynesian econometric theories by creating a continuous flood of money and credit so that an unfolding bust would be reversed and they could all make a lot of money and their friends would make a lot of money when the economy again booms under such an onslaught of new money but which will cause horrendous inflation in consumer prices and people will get grumpy as hell but about which we wont talk at all and well pretend that suffering and misery inflicted by higher prices doesnt exist in reality because it doesnt exist in their stupid stupid stupid little econometric models
4905514 the abolition of the central bank is just a major first step but it is a necessary first step
4905515 millions of americans were made loans beyond their ability to pay
4905516 we need to help them stay in their homes including by converting the home mortgage deduction into a cashable tax credit and creating a homeowners chapter 11 an expedited way to restructure their liabilities
4905517 why is columbia staffing itself with people like this and what is the real value of a degree from columbia given their faculty
4905518 you are unhappy when the federal reserve creates new money and credit which increases the money supply which increases consumer prices and aggregate debt and that is why you say you drink and come in here to torment the waitresses with your stupid leer and crude innuendo and now you are unhappy when the fed doesnt increase money and credit and that is why you are drinking
4905519 my brother is a chemist for a worldwide company he told me yesterday that dow chemical one of his biggest suppliers raised prices by 20 three months ago and now just announced another 25 price hike
4905520 lets get naked and really monkey love nasty because it is the only thing we will have left after the federal reserve has finished destroying us by creating too much money and credit aided and abetted by a corrupt craven congress that wanted to borrow and spend hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year every year now amounting to a debt of over 9 5 trillion spending us into a debtors grave and we racked up a trade deficit of 800 billion a year too do wah diddy diddy
4905521 this is the third time in the last month that you came home late stinking with the stench of whatever gutter in which you were wallowing
4905522 happy if i came home stinking like a sewer only three times a month
4905523 how do you sell something that you dont own is this another of your sleazy mogambo tricks smt to take my money like that honor system coffee fund rip off scam that you set up in the employee lounge last year
4905524 an amount of silver equal to all the known silver bullion in the world
4905525 i have had another medication error or a stroke or something because nothing makes sense anymore stocks are going up when their earnings fall
4905526 silver is needed to maintain and improve future standards of living gold is needed for luxury and emotional reasons silver is for the optimist gold for the pessimist
4905527 i honestly believe that silver must eventually sell for five to ten times what the price of gold may be
4905528 i have days growing more frequent all the time when im convinced the time is now upon us that some big events are about to occur the world economy and political system will share in the chaos about to be unleashed
4905529 hey that sounds a lot like what the stupid loudmouth mogambo slm is always yammering about right before he starts getting hysterical about how it is all caused by the federal reserve creating too much money and credit and proceeding from there to heaping justified insults on congress except ron paul most of the supreme court the united nations all foreigners and malevolent alien beings from outer space who are here to undermine the system prior to conquest by flying saucers and ray guns which predictably leads to how we are freaking doomed and if you are not buying gold and silver then you are some kind of drooling idiot
4905530 gasoline prices over 4 a gallon skyrocketing education and medical care costs
4905531 the collapse of the housing bubble the bursting of the nasdaq bubble stock markets plunging
4905532 the financial crisis still in its early stages is apparent to everyone
4905533 whether well get stagflation the question that will soon be asked is when will the stagflation become an inflationary depression
4905534 were now inside the 90 day window to what i expect will be the fall in the fall of the markets for any number of reasons
4905535 we are now at the point of maximum danger the us may soon tip into a second leg of this crisis as the fiscal package runs out and americans lose jobs in earnest
4905536 real us wages fell at almost 10 percent annualised over may and june
4905537 a ferocious squeeze for an economy already in the grip of the property and debt crunch
4905538 mogambo fella him gone no come back me no speakee english
4905539 americans would regard the sons inheritance of a fathers debt as tyrannical but with the help of congress americans have adopted the same system but on a far larger scale we have passed our ious on to the children of our neighbors children
4905540 today the treasury sells its ious to foreign investors especially foreign central banks something in the range of 40 of the on budget federal debt of 9 trillion is held by foreigners
4905541 today fully 21 of russias monetary reserves are invested in the obligations of fannie freddie and the home loan banks and the largest holder of fannie and freddie debt is another friendly foreigner china
4905542 owns 376 billion worth of u s agency bonds altogether foreigners hold 1 3 trillion of them
4905543 add together the unfunded liabilities from medicare and social security and it comes to 99 2 trillion over the infinite horizon
4905544 traditional medicare composes about 69 percent the new drug benefit roughly 17 percent and social security the remaining 14 percent
4905545 we know from centuries of evidence in countless economies from ancient rome to todays zimbabwe that running the printing press to pay off todays bills leads to much worse problems later on the inflation that results from the flood of money into the economy turns out to be far worse than the fiscal pain those countries hoped to avoid
4905546 purging rampant inflation and a debased currency requires administering a harsh medicine even the perception that the fed is pursuing a cheap money strategy to accommodate fiscal burdens should it take root is a paramount risk to the long term welfare of the u s economy the federal reserve will never let this happen it is not an option ever period
4905547 if so then why in the hell are we here you lying complicit moron federal reserve bastard
4905548 i have the perfect solution i call it the paulson package maybe ill refer to it by its acronym pp give me pp
4905549 what in the hell are you talking about why are you dressed in a thong swimsuit and a red bow tie in the middle of the afternoon and why are you wearing it in my office
4905550 the paulson package solves all of our problems it merely requires you to give me permission to use either unlimited company funds to spend at my total secret discretion or give me immunity to use a bazooka or baseball bat to whack our enemies such as any customer that tries to stop buying from us or bankers that threaten to raise the interest rate on the money we borrow or use as a weapon against any of our internal enemies like the people who file official grievances against me always complaining about how i am rude nasty argumentative lecherous distrustful and creepy and who are all a bunch of liars and backstabbers
4905551 has just passed president bushs bill to redefine the treatment of detainees and the senate is expected to do the same thing buried deep inside this legislation is a provision which will pardon president bush and all the members of his administration of any possible crimes connected with the torture and mistreatment of detainees going all the way back to september 11 2001
4905552 should congress pass a bill giving retroactive immunity to president bush for possible war crimes
4905553 fields calls every day from strip club owners feeling the pinch of a bad economy
4905554 the economy does have one upside for the business its bringing out more women willing to give pole dancing a try
4905555 hey i could use some extra money too im willing to give pole dancing a try
4905556 at least shave your legs and your chest for crying out loud jeez gross
4905557 how much is the market price of gold in dollars if the dollar is worth zero
4905558 even after trebling in price from the low of eight years ago there may be plenty of room for gold to rise from here
4905559 in 1959 the amount invested in gold was about one fifth of the market value of all us common stocks in 1980 the 1 6 trillion invested in gold exceeded the market value of 1 4 trillion in us stocks
4905560 the sum total of gold investment lags far behind the value of stock and bond markets today
4905561 chinese consumers until now recognized as among the worlds most determined savers are adding credit cards to their wallets in record numbers with the number of such cards in circulation almost doubled in the first quarter from a year earlier
4905562 the total number of bank cards including debit cards topped 1 58 billion by march 31 up 29 1 over the year
4905563 the expansion in credit card use is also in line with government goals beijing keen to encourage domestic spending and reduce the countrys dependence on exports to generate growth wants 30 of retail sales to be made through credit and debit cards in big cities by next year from 10 at the end of 2005 according to bloomberg
4905564 guys who think that the congress is a bunch of ignorant corrupt stupid losers which is what you always get at the end of long economic booms
4905565 guys who think that the federal reserve has perversely created so much money and credit in a long boom that staggering inflation in prices is not a surprise but what we deservedly get when we do something as stupid as let a damned central bank create too much money and credit especially as part of a preposterous debt creates money system and especially especially as part of a fiat money system that uses computer memory banks to create money and credit and especially especially especially as part of a monstrous fractional reserve multiplication of the central bank excesses by the banks themselves as they loan out huge freaking multiples hfm of their suddenly increased reserves courtesy of the fed and especially especially especially when the whole thing is built on one huge corrupt fraud after another like when you dont clean up the dog crap in the back yard for so long that one day the dog adding more money to the money supply craps on top of old dog crap just like that and just as savory let me tell you
4905566 at the same time encouraging the use of bank cards helps authorities to track merchants business transactions and tax payments while reducing the openings for money laundering
4905567 bank card based transactions accounted for 25 6 of the countrys total retail sales in the first quarter
4905568 the value of bank card transactions increased even faster rising 58 year on year to 824 6 billion yuan note divide by 6 5 to convert yuan to dollars 130 billion
4905569 divide 6 5 to convert yuan to dollars 130 billion
4905570 more than 8 in the first five months this year
4905571 they also have more to spend with urban disposable incomes rising 11 5 in the first quarter from a year earlier
4905572 the number of individual bank accounts in china rose 9 6 in the first quarter from a year earlier to more than 2 2 billion
4905573 chinas savings rate as a proportion of gross domestic product is about 51 up from about 40 five years ago
4905574 at the end of 2007 the outstanding balance of consumer credit on cards was about 75 billion yuan against a credit line exceeding 630 billion yuan
4905575 if an individual travels to china they will quickly realize that the bull market in commodities is far from over
4905576 if you are not buying gold silver and oil to protect yourself against the fall in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by the federal reserve creating so much money and credit then you are an idiot
4905577 and i can also see that you were probably not too bad looking when you were younger but now you are kind of old and repulsive and can only get skanky ugly chicks to go out with you
4905578 while the company may ride things out the investors will probably lose everything assuming that they have anything left after the 90 loss that the stocks in these two idiots delight government sponsored enterprises have suffered tanking from their recent highs
4905579 us banks have only 130 billion in reserves best estimates call for an additional 600 billion to 900 billion in losses to be suffered which begs the question of where the necessary funds will come from to avert bankruptcy to the bulk of the us banking system
4905580 the consequence down the road two to three years from now is the mushrooming of foreign owned banks operating inside the us economy as foreign institutions are begged for us bank relief aid and sustenance they will surely make demands that is reality they will demand more control over the banks they give assistance to in essence to turn them into tools for the foreign states they will demand a seat on the board of directors for instance their governments will also demand for reform to us laws regarding foreign entities operating as banks inside the united states
4905581 we now know who our slavemasters will be but who is going to pay for all the incomprehensible amounts of money with which u s treasury secretary henry paulson wants to buy unlimited stakes in and lend to fannie mae and freddie mac which is more money doomed to be eventually lost until these two embarrassing bankrupted government sponsored enterprise monstrosities are finally dissolved and put out of our misery but in the meantime means that a lot of that money will end up in the pockets of their current owners in a big bail out
4905582 everyone will pay either in taxes or inflation but almost certainly both
4905583 except the people who own gold silver oil and commodities which will soar in price when priced in u s dollars or any other stupid nations stupid currency when their central bank is like the fed with the governments permission creating too much money and credit which inflates the money supply which makes prices go up and up and everybody is miserable
4905584 dear ms allison bybee i like your name i like your article please send me photographs of yourself naked thank you
4905585 in the last 2 months alone food stamp applications are up 30
4905586 anywhere from 10 a month to several hundred dollars depending on your situation
4905587 up to 3 600 a year per recipient for years and years to come
4905588 high prices poor economy rough times pushing families over the edge
4905589 we are seeing a lot more people that never applied in the past thats a significant change you have people that have significantly lost income
4905590 this is insane and such insane monetary policy can come from asylums for the blubberingly irrationally insane or the federal reserve however redundant that seems to be
4905591 the government is making it easy to grab an application online
4905592 estimate that about 10 billion dollars is needed to meet short term needs of people hit hardest by the crisis
4905593 what we are witnessing is not a natural disaster a silent tsunami or a perfect storm it is a man made catastrophe and as such must be fixed by people
4905594 technical advice loans credits and grants for poverty reduction and the improvement of living standards
4905595 anybody strictly following awesome mogambo investment advice amia to buy only gold silver and oil and things related to them would have made a big damned pot full of money and kicked investment ass the whole time as a result of betting against a federal reserve creating excess money and credit which means that gold silver and oil will soar in freaking value as the dollar loses its value due to the excess creation which they did in spades and now i look like the freaking genius that i am and everybody else can kiss my big fat butt
4905596 among the most awful pitches is something thats being touted as an employee benefit the 401 k debit card this allows you to treat your retirement fund as a cash account to withdraw money
4905597 hmmm i like this new idea and if i find a way to conveniently tap into my wifes 401 k to get some money to fund a little party for my hoodlum friends and me then i like the idea even more
4905598 oh yeah you think im scared of my wife is that what you think huh is that what you think punk
4905599 debited withdrawals are treated as loans subject to interest and fees and must be paid back within five years
4905600 unlike a checking account linked debit card you will owe income taxes plus a 10 percent penalty if you are younger than 59 1 2
4905601 falling stock markets around the globe and the credit crunch are putting the pension funds of some of the largest u s companies into deeper financial holes since the credit crunch hit last fall pension plans funded by s amp p 500 companies have lost about 280 billion in assets according to an actuary at mercer a human resources consulting firm the losses amount to about 7 of a total 4 trillion in pension plan assets
4905602 i didnt do what you said when you said to buy gold silver and oil and now i am a loser boo hoo hoo help me
4905603 since 67 consumer prices are officially up seven times wages in america are up exactly the same amount in other words during your editors entire adult lifetime americans per hour earnings have not increased a single penny
4905604 the dollar index has fallen 41 against the euro during the bush 43 presidency
4905605 the wizards at the bureau of labor statistics have somehow found unemployment still at 5
4905606 wheres the change from that twenty you still owe me
4905607 check this out the debt to the penny just went up by 30 billion on june 30 after basically being flat for two months it makes one rather suspicious of the validity of the numbers
4905608 investing long term in the stock market to fund a retirement
4905609 adjusted for inflation and dividends the return on the s amp p 500 was negative for the decade that ended on june 30
4905610 in fact probably the most influential macroeconomic theory of our time at the heart of the doctrine stands the so called dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model nowadays the main analytical tool of central banks all over the world
4905611 in this model money and credit play no direct role nor does the financial market the models technical features ensure that financial markets have no economic consequences in the long run
4905612 is that central banks can safely ignore monetary aggregates and credit they should also ignore asset prices and deal only with the economic consequences of an asset price bust
4905613 we might want to question whether the recipes that got us into this mess are also most suited to get us out again
4905614 a recession is not the worst possible outcome the worst is for this crisis to go on and on for minskys moment to become an eternity
4905615 how can interest rates rise to cool down raging inflation when there is this damned much buying of bonds driving up their prices and driving down their imputed yield
4905616 if the fed raises rates to prevent a sell off in dollars theyll crush the highly indebted and already struggling populace and in so doing unleash a serious economic crisis but if the fed keeps rates where they are or even lowers them theyll trigger a dollar sell off and unleash a serious economic crisis
4905617 either way the story ends the same a serious economic crisis
4905618 if you dont want to peg your damned stupid currency to the stupid dollar why in the hell would you want to peg your stupid currency to a basket of other stupid currencies that are being pegged to the stupid dollar ya moron
4905619 you should be buying gold with every freaking dime you morons
4905620 the dollar has fallen against other major currencies against the euro for example it is worth barely half what it was at its high which was reached shortly after the euro was launched 10 years ago against gold it is worth only about a third of what it was worth 10 years ago and against oil the loss has been even greater its down about 80
4905621 for a while stocks in the energy basic material consumer non cyclical and utility sectors kept rising but even those have begun to stumble
4905622 helping people own their own home as part of the hallowed american dream
4905623 im as mad as hell and i am not going to take this anymore and the people of connecticut owe me our children and the united states a huge huge huge apology for electing the egregious christopher dodd
4905624 golds star is on the wane in india the worlds biggest consumer of the precious metal as record prices finally take their toll on demand
4905625 hahahaha morons i told you to buy gold when your stupid government let the corrupt federal reserve start creating all that money and credit which means that inflation in prices will soar in direct relation to the excess of money created which is freaking massive hahaha but did you no you called the police and had them come over here to make me shut up just because it was 2 00 am and you wanted to sleep like a stupid little baby through the catastrophe that is the damned economy hahaha i loathe you all
4905626 nowadays purchasing power exceeds purchasing opportunity most of all there is not enough oil and too few raw materials and food products
4905627 the price of a barrel of crude oil 159 liters has increased from 25 16 in 2002 to 135 87 in 2008 and it is also why the price of corn has tripled in the same time period while that of copper has almost quintupled
4905628 if the inflation introduced in the united states is excluded a small miracle is revealed namely something approaching price stability
4905629 admit it admit that it is true that i am not the worst husband and father the world has ever seen admit it damn it admit it admit it admit it
4905630 if you ignored all the stupid mistakes i made and you forgot all the complaints about me from clients and all the other stupid employees then i was not the worst employee in the whole company im at least borderline borderline damn it admit it admit it admit it
4905631 adjusted for inflation prices are in fact rising by only 2 3 percent
4905632 officials with the international monetary fund imf have informed bernanke about a plan that would have been unheard of in the past a general examination of the us financial system the imfs board of directors has ruled that a so called financial sector assessment program fsap is to be carried out in the united states it is nothing less than an x ray of the entire us financial system
4905633 under its bylaws the imf is charged with the supervision of the international monetary system
4905634 roughly two thirds of imf members but never the united states have already endured this painful procedure
4905635 as part of the assessment the fed the securities and exchange commission sec the major investment banks mortgage banks and hedge funds will be asked to hand over confidential documents to the imf team they will be required to answer the questions they are asked during interviews their databases will be subjected to so called stress tests worst case scenarios designed to simulate the broader effects of failures of other major financial institutions or a continuing decline of the dollar
4905636 overhanging the markets for a number of years has been the question as to when the major holders of excess u s dollars in the global financial system might look to dump those holdings an opportunity for that dumping is at hand
4905637 most central banks know that their unwanted dollar hoards are going to generate long term losses but the oil markets have opened up an opportunity to mitigate some of those losses for the rest of the world dollar dumping now would reduce inflation risks outside the united states
4905638 over the longer term u s equities bonds and the greenback should suffer terribly while gold and silver prices should boom
4905639 big losses measured in dollars and still bigger ones measured in their own currency
4905640 a sudden rush for the exits cannot be ruled out completely
4905641 a very nasty period is soon to be upon us be prepared
4905642 us banks have suffered us 391 billion of losses and write downs from mortgage related securities since the start of 2007 according to the data compiled by bloomberg us banks could lose another us 300 billion on real estate loans during the year ahead
4905643 such losses could jeopardize balance sheets because the us banking system had only us 1 350 billion of equity capital
4905644 the sum of it all is that the entire us banking and financial system is so threadbare fragile and short of capital that a collapse or crash in one place could knock the underpinnings out from under several other us financial sectors which would take even more down with them a systemic crash at any time is today a distinct possibility
4905645 american equity markets show no real capital gains since 1997 that is an american who bought the equivalent of the standard and poors 500 index at 954 in january 1997 and sold today at 1 278 would have exactly the same number of inflation adjusted dollars
4905646 my advice to individual investors invest in some popcorn because the next six months will be something to watch
4905647 you can be sure something really stupid is about to happen
4905648 nip it in the bud andy nip it nip it
4905649 the economy today is much different from the mid 1970s
4905650 in fact things are much worse than in the 70s and the irritating idiot mogambo iim was right the federal reserve creating so much money and credit has destroyed the dollar were freaking doomed
4905651 in 1974 inflation as measured by the consumer price index was 12 percent unemployment in the parallel recession peaked at 9 in early 1975
4905652 all large inflations involve too much money chasing too few goods as economist milton friedman often noted and this episode is no exception
4905653 the fed is holding its key interest rate at 2 percent well below prevailing inflation
4905654 by contrast today theres not yet a wage price spiral inflationary pressures seem to originate mostly in rising raw materials prices
4905655 for the federal reserve to be given new explicit powers to intervene in the workings of wall street firms
4905656 new explicit powers to intervene in the workings of wall street firms the federal reserve congress and the supreme court and let me go stomping in there anytime i want wielding a baseball bat in my mighty mogambo fist of vengeance mmfov and start imparting some monetary and constitutional sense to those morons with as the saying goes a whack to remember it by making them do anything i say whether they like it or not and extend my powers to total dominion over cheerleaders too
4905657 our nation has come to expect the federal reserve to step in to avert events that pose unacceptable systemic risk
4905658 no no no the fed is supposed to protect the value of the dollar which it has completely failed to do and now it has created so much money and so much inflation in asset prices that they created the unacceptable systemic risk you are talking about you moron in fact the federal reserve is so incompetent and stupid that the dollar has lost almost 98 of its buying power since 1913 when the fed was authorized by a few corrupt congressional politicians on christmas eve 1913 when everybody else was away and now you want to give the fed more powers youre a freaking imbecile or insane or both
4905659 why do you think prices have gone up you ignorant stupid halfwits
4905660 has neither the clear statutory authority nor the mandate to anticipate and deal with risks across our entire financial system
4905661 we should quickly consider how to appropriately give the fed the authority to access necessary information from highly complex financial institutions and the responsibility to intervene in order to protect the system so they can carry out the role our nation has come to expect
4905662 we expect you to do the job of protecting the value of the dollar which is why the damned fed was created in the first place which the fed has manifestly completely failed to do
4905663 however with its increased willingness to rescue the big financial firms from their own excesses perhaps paulson sees an expanded fed as the best way to ensure the continued prosperity of his former pals on wall street
4905664 oh save me from the horrors of such inflation in prices that comes from inflation in the money supply mighty magnificent mogambo mmm and by the way your manly mogambo arms mma get me hot take me im yours
4905665 like food and gasoline getting so highly priced that you cant buy them you freaking morons
4905666 do any of you morons know what will happen if the government slows down its spending chaos the government is so huge and so many people now depend upon it for everything that the government cannot stop spending and so the fed cannot stop creating excess money and credit because there is nowhere else from which the government can get that much money inflation will turn to rioting in the streets
4905667 we have all heard about the decadence of the ancient romans but how much of this is true
4905668 are confirming the classical authors accounts of the roman taste for luxury banquets were extravagant feasts where patrons competed to outdo and outspend each other
4905669 how much would one of these roman feasts cost today
4905670 is that all at a lousy 667 per reveler it almost costs that much to fill the gas tank on my damned car hahahaha
4905671 wrote that his friend the food writer apicius drank poison and committed suicide rather than give up the gluttonous lifestyle he could no longer afford
4905672 the consumer is plainly hurting from the tightening squeeze of skimpy income and stingy hiring on the one hand and on the other the remorseless inflation thats daily causing him and her so much angst the longer investors refuse to face up to the bitter truth about the economy the credit mess the shambles that is housing contracting corporate profits and the shaky underpinning of the market the worse the shock when the day of reckoning comes
4905673 has been in an uptrend for the last 34 years
4905674 fiat currency n money made of paper or electronic entries in a computer which is the ultimate something for nothing in that the money supply expanded with money that nobody worked for nobody earned but somebody got to buy some things with it artificially increasing demand for those things making prices go up and up and up until you are screaming your guts out
4905675 the dow measured in gold began its crash long ago resulting in the decimation of over 75 of the dows real value
4905676 welcome to american fantasy world as we americans have constructed an entire economy based on this very same stupid idea and convinced everyone else to go along with it and now you are stuck with it hahaha
4905677 hey you stupid kid what do you think about the federal reserve creating monetary inflation by creating too much money and credit which immediately causes a dollar for dollar increase in debt and sets the stage for a raging crippling terrible long lasting inflation in consumer prices which means that you are going to watch your mother and father screaming as they are financially killed by the ruination of all their assets and their money and they will lose everything thanks to the federal reserve and then all of you will die horrible painful deaths how do you like modern economic theory so far you doomed ugly little rug rat
4905678 already a good share of argentinas debt is in default what else to do you call it when a government that owes over 30 billion in inflation indexed debt manipulates its consumer price statistics
4905679 the government is publishing an understated inflation rate that is used for calculating indexation payments
4905680 fudging indexation clauses to effectively default on debt is an old game
4905681 effectively rewriting the contracts of foreign holders of u s debt
4905682 the word inflation originally applied solely to the quantity of money it meant that the volume of money was inflated blown up overextended
4905683 to use the word inflation to mean a rise in prices is to deflect attention away from the real cause of inflation and the real cure for it
4905684 i remember in the summer of 2006 i would face my blank computer screen on a friday and wonder what i could write about
4905685 goldilocks all the time today there is such a target rich environment the problem today is trying to decide what not to write about
4905686 we probably saw a decrease in jobs of at least 100 000 the market was upset with 40 000
4905687 what will it do when the monthly number prints 100 000 later this year and it likely will
4905688 the federal reserve projects that unemployment will rise to 6 that means there are a lot more jobs to be lost
4905689 and that is if unemployment stops at 6 which would be a very mild recession indeed
4905690 march was revised down by 7 000 and april by 8 000 weve now had four consecutive months of downward first revisions and also four consecutive downward second revisions unusual strings that support the picture of a weakening employment trend
4905691 one of the best indicators of the direction of employment is temporary employment if the workload is shrinking the first thing you do is lay off your temporary help or simply do not hire them
4905692 temporary employment is down 5 7 year over year and is showing continued monthly deterioration with each passing month since last october
4905693 terrific news maybe they will lay off the temps and keep me
4905694 the yield on the two year treasury which moves opposite its price had the biggest weekly rise since 82
4905695 president nixon instated price controls on the 15th of august 1971 inflation was a little over 4 at the time
4905696 or isnt there one if the worlds population is going to implode will that be through mass starvation dehydration or will we run out of beer and all end up killing each other or will a terrorist bomb wipe us all out first will technology save the day isnt the whole thing survival of the fittest is survival of the fittest really the best way of describing it for the human race or is it more luck is there a solution or do we just sit back and watch the world fall apart
4905697 bernanke told a credulous audience last week that higher oil prices were driving up the risk of inflation this is exactly backward inflation has already happened price increases for oil and other goods are occurring now to reconcile the prices of things with the depreciated value of paper money
4905698 the fundamental problem however is not paper money its not the long absence of a gold standard here and everywhere the inflation problem is an absence of moral commitment to maintaining the value of money
4905699 monetary authorities and political masters who read the markets and take action to maintain a constant value of money
4905700 why do we need joint ownership of stuff lets put it all in my name and you can trust me
4905701 bankers and politicians will please refrain from destroying a fiat money by over issuance
4905702 make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts
4905703 oil is now serving as the source of global monetary discipline that gold used to perform oil supplies are severely constrained dollar supplies arent in the era of bretton woods the global monetary system followed the golden rule he who has the gold makes the rules but today the rule of crude dominates
4905704 thats why todays oil buyers like the late french president charles de gaulle are so eager to exchange their dollars for a tangible asset de gaulle shipped frances dollar reserves across the atlantic in exchange for gold bars from the vaults of fort knox today oil traders are shipping their excess dollars to the new york mercantile exchange in exchange for barrels of oil the motives are identical only the underlying monetary asset has changed
4905705 in the long term it does not matter what central bankers say what matters is what they have done gold and oil are going to go a lot higher but how high ill tell you perhaps 8 500 for gold and 400 for oil
4905706 despite all the rhetoric nobody has actually done anything yet
4905707 why oh why would anyone buy a bond or a gilt you might get yields of 3 4 or 5 but the cost of living is patently rising by so much more than that virtually guaranteed to lose purchasing power it just doesnt make any sense
4905708 the bubble if its anywhere is in bonds and they in my humble opinion will be the next one to pop
4905709 note what the fdic is saying here the banking industry reported 5 8 billion in earnings to its investors but restatements took that total down by 89
4905710 the combined profits of all fdic insured banks plunged 46 in the first quarter banks in the u s made 14 billion less last quarter than they did the year before
4905711 the u s budget deficit for may widened to 165 9 billion bigger than the shortfall for all of fiscal 2007
4905712 the government spending since the fiscal year started oct 1 was up 9 7 to 1 993 trillion through may
4905713 year to date deficit at a 319 4 billion more than double the eighth month cumulative 148 5 billion shortage reported a year earlier
4905714 the u s congress has quietly approved the biggest government budget in the history of mankind
4905715 oh and by the way congress earmarked a law in the latest budget to raise the national debt ceiling the u s can now owe the world 10 6 trillion an 800 billion increase
4905716 the notional value of all outstanding derivatives now totals approximately 1 144 quadrillion
4905717 the saudis are taking in something like 10 billion a week
4905718 i see that the derivatives market expanded 44 last year according to the bis and now sits at 596 trillion dollars thats spelled with a t if this pace keeps up by this time next year total derivatives will exceed one quadrillion dollars thats spelled with a q
4905719 what are you so afraid of you big mogambo sissy bms
4905720 prove perhaps one hundred times the amount of silver exists on paper than exists in the physical world
4905721 were in the money were in the money we got a lot of what it takes to get along because i have silver and now for once in my pathetic wretched life i am going to be the squeezer while some other sorry bastard is going to be the squeezee and hell lose his butt for a change while were in the money were in the money
4905722 were in the money were in the money we got a lot of what it takes to get along and hire lots of lawyers to file lots of nuisance lawsuits against my enemies like my wife and kids whom i sue just to show my other enemies the kind of relentless heartless grudge carrying bastard that i am so that they might more accurately anticipate the kind of non stop legal butt kicking they can expect when i finally get around to them which i will because i got lots and lots of silver and i can afford it now that were in the money were in the money
4905723 the derivatives markets are alive and well in both silver and gold
4905724 there is roughly one hundred ounces claimed on paper for every physical ounce of silver
4905725 david morgan of silverinvestor com and the morgan report today may have settled the question of manipulation of the silver market in his new essay silver price manipulation morgan notes that while there is no limit on the creation of paper promises to deliver silver on the new york commodities exchange the exchange limits silver deliveries to 7 5 million ounces per month that is the exchanges rules are overwhelmingly stacked in favor of those shorting the metal
4905726 why doesnt some big investor come along and just buy up the remaining silver
4905727 it cannot be done there are delivery limits now let me repeat it cannot be done there are delivery limits now
4905728 oh you might ask is there any limit to the amount of silver that can be sold on paper
4905729 there is no limit to the amount of paper silver that can be created
4905730 if the perth mint is storing your metal they admit that they may have loaned your metal out to agr matthey
4905731 agr matthey has well established relationships with the major bullion banks and regularly supplies to them on a contractual basis
4905732 the 880 million of precious metals deposited by perth mint depository clients note 17 was used in operations by gold corporation as inventory 381 million note 8b
4905733 not far from the misery indexs low of 6 1 seen in 1998
4905734 do you have any freaking idea how stupid you are to believe anything a government tells you
4905735 using the estimates on cpi and unemployment from economists skeptical of the government numbers the misery index is actually in the teens some worry it could even approach the post world war ii record of 20 6
4905736 the coins each containing about an ounce of silver have become so popular among investors seeking alternatives to stocks and real estate that the u s mint cant make them fast enough in march the mint stopped taking orders for the bullion coins late last month it began limiting how many coins its 13 authorized buyers worldwide are allowed to purchase
4905737 customers demanding twice as many as they did last year
4905738 like to buy 500 000 a week but the mint will sell him only around 100 000
4905739 in march sales of silver eagles surged more than ninefold from the previous month to 1 85 million
4905740 the royal canadian mint saw its sales of silver canadian maple leaf bullion coins rise 40 last year to 3 5 million according to a spokesman
4905741 growing in popularity and some investors are betting that its value will surge as inventory shrinks
4905742 which are the only american silver coins allowed in individual retirement plans
4905743 for small investors silver eagles are an accessible way to get into the metal boom
4905744 the national curriculum was designed at a time when teachers did have the monopoly on information students didnt have access to the wealth of information they do now
4905745 the students have had an element of choice and that they are meeting teachers that they dont normally meet
4905746 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4905747 black amp white all mixt together the hidden legacy of enslaved southern craftsmen
4905748 a multimedia musical journey through the history of north carolina
4905749 we couldnt be more thrilled for and proud of ben and blaine
4905750 their artistry dedication and enthusiasm for their craft make them the perfect choices for princess grace awards
4905751 i always thought he was one of the great figures in our history
4905752 but after writing angels i have an even greater respect for what a good man he was not just a great leader but a really thoughtful and interesting and good person
4905753 to celebrate lincolns birthday by letting todays composers comment on our fluid understanding of this legendary man
4905754 his integrity his sense of humor and his poetic vision
4905755 i just think that the rhythm of spoken language is so musical but at the same time its very ambiguous its not something you can pin down easily
4905756 its just so beautiful what he says to this fellow whos trying to protect lincolns good name
4905757 he says dont try to protect my good name thats not your job your job is to serve the people if you have something bad to say about me say it
4905758 it seems it was just smoke and mirrors it wasnt something lincoln did or said the guy was just trying to smear lincolns name lincoln said you can say anything about it if its true thats my problem you cant betray the people you cant hide things its so inspiring to see a leader who has the self confidence to value truth over loyalty
4905759 the slow food movement which encourages people to find locally produced whole foods and take care and delight in their preparation has found resonance around the world despite or perhaps because of the dominance of manufactured foods
4905760 in the same way making things with our hands the slow way may be more important now than it has ever been
4905761 very good facilities and the equipment required for the varied classes we offer
4905762 they can make art without much equipment as their focus matures the equipment they will need will become clearer
4905763 there might be some hobbyists some retirees and college students
4905764 then there are professional artists who want to try their hand at something new
4905765 my total experiencing with cork is trying to get it out of the end of a wine bottle
4905766 i dont know what to expect i have no preconceived ideas
4905767 nurturing our young artists as they make their first professional career steps
4905768 our program with the kenan institute and the unc school of the arts is a model partnership
4905769 we are introducing ncsa graduates to national professional networks and life long opportunities for growth and renewal enabling young artists access to studios and mentors is a great gift it is our desire for this program to give them an even greater chance for success as artists
4905770 to choose something that i was interested in vs just going through foundation courses
4905771 you dont get a choice at ncsa about what you want to do

4906003 we still think a great deal of cla as a member of our ballclub and what he can do in our bullpen to make us a successful ballclub and hes a very important part of that
4906004 he couldnt walk two days ago that vitamin mineral water hes been drinking worked wonders i think the doctor gave him a little feel good shot too that probably helped
4906005 he looked good tonight tomorrow will be the real test
4906006 they look uncomfortable because im the type of catcher that tries to get low give a low target to pitchers but i may give it a shot
4906007 lets win another nine and nobody will remember this one
4906008 we had some people up there who we have all the confidence in the world in and we didnt get it done
4906009 i can take a lot of positives from todays game
4906010 i know i had a leadoff home run to put them on the board early and thats kind of a disappointment but there were a lot of positives from my aspect we werent happy we didnt get those guys on base in tonight but i think well come around tomorrow and bounce right back
4906011 it was a cutter to ramirez and i left it in the middle
4906012 he got his bat head out front and it just barely got over the fence its disappointing it was the first at bat of the game
4906013 ramirez was seeing the ball pretty well off me and i figured i had a pretty good chance to get ross
4906014 i made a good pitch and i think he was looking for one pitch and muscled it past the second baseman for an rbi single
4906015 i had a shot there and didnt get it done some other shots didnt work out
4906016 ive got some people hurt you cant play everybody in this hot weather in august especially in places like atlanta where you play a doubleheader and then play here you better rotate your team we dont want to be empty after labor day we want to keep the team fresh and play
4906017 why sure we can grab dinner if you really want to
4906018 he takes his medicine morning and night and he had to take it 30 minutes before hed eat
4906019 i know youve got a lot of questions for me but it really doesnt matter
4906020 you can ask me anything you want and im a happy man
4906021 it was good for us to come out and show what we can do
4906022 it gave us confidence to play like weve been practicing and things will fall into place
4906023 we drove the ball pretty well but weve got to go get touchdowns and not field goals
4906024 he got my shoulder when it was coming through and it was just a 5 minute thing
4906025 i dont think in the regular season it would have been a big deal
4906026 the only way i know how to get out of these little ruts is to keep throwing
4906027 i promise you if i came out in the second half i would have kept throwing
4906028 i might have had 10 picks but i would have kept throwing the ball down the field
4906029 we just need to keep working on that and realize that weve won a preseason game its good in some ways but in others it doesnt mean anything
4906030 it was really nice to see him move the ball in the middle of the field and run with it
4906031 i thought chad did a nice job of managing the game all around
4906032 we didnt move the ball we got totally stuffed offensively defensively we never slowed them down special teams never won the field position it was an ugly half to be honest
4906033 were not going to make every play but there were plays we left out on the field
4906034 when i have mike walker running down pretty much wide open i know he kind of got jammed at the line but i still have to make that a catchable ball for him you dont want to miss your layups
4906035 he came in last week and picked up the playbook in two days maybe he became a leader on offense in the first day
4906036 when i go home ill think of you often and when i do ill now be able to picture you in your apartment with your wonderful boyfriend or with your great friends and ill know that youre content and that life is treating you well and in turn ill be happy with you
4906037 ill have a dirty martini with top shelf vodka do you have top shelf vodka tanqueray or grey goose
4906038 a dirty martini is easy to make two olives a little olive juice a splash of vermouth and the rest is top shelf vodka do you have top shelf vodka
4906039 im happy with the way this first game this first chance to play went
4906040 i felt like i played average at best but its a start and you have to start somewhere
4906041 i will take a few 4 yard carries like i had tonight
4906042 i ran with some toughness ive had to stay patient through the whole process and im still trying to make all the effort over the last year pay off
4906043 the other week he was at a polo shoot and i kept telling him to not eat while he was wearing his clothes hes adhd though you have to really watch him trust me hell be all over the place tony come over here right now

4906046 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
4906047 they were all in agreement that they would rather have the off days
4906048 it keeps them stronger and more refreshed even though over the course of the year cc and ben will have one less start it works really really well and we set up better for the postseason doing it that way
4906049 i like to get the extra days late in the season
4906050 you go all year and its good to get the extra days in september im all for it no doubt youre definitely stronger and it sets up to pitch in the playoffs
4906051 if you give me the ball im going to take it it aint a big deal this is what weve been doing all year if we were changing it would be a story
4906052 if bob bowman his coach and i were in for the money wed be in different sports im doing this because i love it it seems like every day im in a dream world im just happy to be in the real world

4906070 i think well narrowly skirt a global recession and the reason is well get relative strong growth albeit reduced growth out of developing economies like china
4906071 what we like are the consumer plays as much as possible we are trying to get exposure to consumer oriented sectors whether that is consumer banking or retail
4906072 that call got a lot of initial resistance because it was the only part of peoples portfolios that were doing well
4906073 to get investors to buy domestic asia and domestic emerging markets is very difficult because the fear now is a rapid loss of economic momentum in emerging markets we would argue that fear is overdone

4906088 amid all the international gloom what a truly wonderful day yesterday for britains olympic hopes
4906089 while the awful summer weather keeps us indoors we can thank team gb for dispelling the gloom there may be clouds over britain but yesterday they had a gold lining
4906090 so for a moment lets forget the politics that seems to have dominated these olympics lets just admire the achievement marvel at the hard work and look forward to more of the same
4906091 all britains olympic medal winners deserve much praise for helping us to feel good about ourselves for showing that we still have among us many determined self disciplined and hard working men and women who are supremely good at what they do
4906092 but the heart lifts especially for rebecca adlington who combines astonishing superlative talent with an engaging very british modesty and humour
4906093 she also makes it look easy when the truth is that her victory is the result of years of relentless training and single mindedness
4906094 that would be great anything that comes as a product of her success is richly deserved
4906095 what she has achieved is amazing i thought she was amazing before this but i love her even more now
4906096 she is the greatest person i have ever met her success has completely blown me away
4906097 im so proud of rebecca and cant wait to see her her achievements are enormous and she is so touched by the reaction of everyone at home
4906098 she has been rewarded for all her hard work and training over the years and hopefully what shes done can spur on a new generation of swimmers to emulate her i dont think what she has done yet has quite sunk in for any of us
4906099 our victorious olympians are genuine role models partly because their prime motivation is not money but rather love of their sport
4906100 we have developed a whole range of responses for coping with failure but in the last week british spectators have had the unusual experience of seeing british competitors win

4906114 this was an outbreak with a high attack rate our future advice to the race organizers is to inspect the route prior to the race to ensure it is not littered with animal feces and not end the race at the horse ring if there is any horse poop they have to remove it
4906115 it isnt every day you get to be called a world champion
4906116 theyre not good watchdogs theyll watch anybody take anything but they can be intimidating because of their size
4906117 i find the older ones are more steady than the younger ones youve got to counteract that puppy exhuberance

4906119 last fall i was in harvard square where a former student of mine was playing on the street and i sat in and did a couple of tunes and made sure he didnt announce that it was me i played out at a plaza at a ski resort in deer valley utah and i played a couple of tunes again the same thing

4906123 the early attraction comes from playing to people in safe places getting a job opening for somebody playing open mike nights all of the usual things ultimately an audience is developed by media exposure and thats how you get a large audience
4906124 there is no ego ever because you need the audience and the audience does not need you the fact is that what people pay for is they pay to be paid attention to this is why jimmy buffett does so well he does so well because he pays beautiful attention to the people who pay his salary he viscerally understands the equation

4906127 you feel like a human jukebox sometimes spitting out the same songs
4906128 from my experience they say were a disturbance to the peace but ultimately if you look at it this is a commercial area
4906129 i see myself as an addition to the amusement and adventure and entertainment the area provides
4906130 they dont like to see me make as much money as i can
4906131 im not taking nothing away from what theyre doing so it hurts them none to ignore me and let me do what im doing

4906163 some following the word frame for themselves proofs others giving themselves up to pleasures wrest scripture according to their lusts we have as the source of teaching the lord by the prophets the gospel and the blessed apostles in many and various ways leading from the beginning of knowledge to the end so consequently we also persuade from faith by demonstration giving a complete exhibition of he scriptures from the scriptures themselves those who follow heresies also venture to avail themselves of the prophetic scriptures however they will not make use of all the scriptures and they will not quote them entirely not as the body and texture of prophecy prescribe instead selecting ambiguous expressions they wrest them to their own opinions gathering a few expressions here and there they do not look to the sense of the words but simply make use of the words themselves for in almost all the quotations they make you will find that they attend to the names alone while they alter the meanings they neither know as they claim to nor use the quotations they cite according to their true nature however the truth is not found by changing the meanings for so people subvert all true teaching but in the consideration of what perfectly belongs to and becomes the sovereign god and in the corroboration of each point demonstrated in the scriptures from similar scriptures
4906164 the fame of anthony came even unto kings for constantine augustus and his sons wrote letters to him as to a father and begged an answer from him
4906165 the expressions of old and in these last days foreshadow some other meaning when a long time had intervened when we were on the edge of punishment when the gifts had failed when there was no expectation of deliverance when we were expecting to have less than all it was then that we were given more
4906166 he spoke to us in his son instead of by the son for he did not speak in him as an instrument but rather through him as one indwelling the flesh for when he had said he has spoken to us in his son whom he appointed as an heir no created as an heir he applied the word to his existence before the ages and he does this intelligently now leading us up into theology now bringing us down into the incarnation
4906167 for at the end of the ages the son himself spoke to us through himself no longer through the mediation of a prophet or the voice of saints but through himself the only begotten by being born into our condition spoke with us and we say that the father spoke in the son not as through a human being somehow established as a special kind of mediator or as one declaring a message to us which was not his own but anothers rather the son spoke to us in his own voice through his own body for the flesh belonged to the only begotten and not to anyone else though god by nature he became human while remaining god

4906209 i dont think that a country that behaves in the way russia has with tanks rolling across the streets of democratic countries that sort of behaviour is not compatible with being a member of the g8
4906210 russia keeps saying she wants to be a full member of the international community and part of the g8 and part of the world trade organisation and have a strong relationship with the eu european union
4906211 if she behaves like this she will have none of those things

4906224 daniel has been a producer with johnny depp so it has got a lot of authenticity and it gives the reader an insiders view of hollywood
4906225 its about a fictitious gangster who decides the only way to get someone to make his film is to blackmail a famous actor to be in it this is no connection to johnny its about daniel wanting to be recognised as a writer rather than as johnnys brother theres no gossip in it you read it for finding out how hollywood works

4906232 no the difference is that hes finally written something thats every bit as good if not better than anything youve ever done and its killing you youre so selfish you make me sick
4906233 did it ever occur to you that maybe someone else in this family can write
4906234 theres no surer way to turn new female fans into former female fans than by complaining about how hard it is to keep on weight
4906235 you dont want to be the kid who sits in the dorm room and does nothing
4906236 a conservative estimate which will require careful budgeting on your part
4906237 my gut instinct is that there will be a wide disparity about what rates are quoted on these sites and what they actually end up with and not necessarily due to the borrower
4906238 all the sites may not collect all the data thats necessary to give an actual price quote
4906239 its easy reliable accurate and fast theres no bait and switch
4906240 if you look at a natural retail cycle in five to 10 years unless you reinvent yourself sales start to plateau
4906241 upon re invention there is an automatic surge in sales
4906242 all the department stores own their respective buildings and adjacent parking lots so its important for them to keep pace as well
4906243 department stores are struggling because mall traffic across the board is down
4906244 our numbers say that traffic in malls this year has been down 10 percent to 14 percent over last year across the u s when traffic is down that much its pretty hard to have any sales increases because youre seeing fewer people
4906245 belk has done a good job by not vacating their home department because so many department stores are just overgrown apparel stores
4906246 the more modern customers want a little more fashion and a little more style
4906247 they are responding to newness new is big and we try to be out there with the fashion statements and colors
4906248 usually consumers who are under 35 are much more appearance store driven than people over 40
4906249 so if you do remodel a store and really upgrade it and make it more contemporary of today youll get more younger shoppers immediately checking you out
4906250 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
4906251 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
4906252 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
4906253 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
4906254 womens wear has painted themselves in a corner by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything
4906255 if you are keeping up with fashion people notice and it gives them more confidence
4906256 the businesses may still operate for the remaining 18 hours a day
4906257 therefore the law is merely a reasonable regulation on the time place and manner in which plaintiffs may exercise their first amendment rights
4906258 something like that only gives them justification to say see
4906259 this is a disease and its not funny and what its doing to our children is not funny

4906276 think about that because buried treasure is so deeply entrenched in our culture that we never ask why pirates did it and the truth is that they didnt i know of no proven instance of pirates burying their treasure this isnt surprising pirates lived short lives they didnt set aside for the future when they got money it went on girls booze and food you didnt stick in a hole in the ground to get 5 75 interest minus tax at standard rate you didnt set it aside for the future because you didnt have a future blackbeard the most famous of all pirates lasted about fifteen months till the navy caught him and killed him and cut his head off
4906277 since robert louis stevenson was dead and i was fascinated by this period of history
4906278 one of my biggest concerns is to make sure the matawan police department is very much in touch with the community
4906279 we are a small community and we get a lot of support we try to give back as much as possible
4906280 this is one night where we meet people on a positive note
4906281 we need to be in touch with the community they need to have the ability to reach out to us not just on special occasions but at all times
4906282 arctic meltdown the polar ice cap may be shrinking much faster than scientist thought
4906283 the usa did nothing to protect the innocent civilians of south ossetia from georgian aggression
4906284 if russia in accordance with its mandate of peacekeeping and protecting the lives of innocent civilians did not interfere in the conflict then the threat of a widespread fire throughout the caucasus would have become a reality our country protected not only its own national interests but also those of its neighbours and restored the status quo in this complicated region after restoring the peace at the same time moscow gave the west to understand that after saakashvili committed this crime with the tacit support of the usa it is necessary to recast the discussion concerning the future of this region we shall be not be bound by previous agreements and in the new strategic situation the role of russia in the caucasus shall grow
4906285 do not disregard the diktat of washington or you shall pay a very dear price
4906286 of course that leaves us with no choice but to go back to court
4906287 we hear from millington quarrys counsel they will be back in court thats their choice
4906288 why would anyone pay to cart fill 50 miles and why would they then pay millington quarry on top of that to dump it if it is clean fill
4906289 it would behoove us to develop it safely so we can continue our investment in the future

4906305 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4906306 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4906307 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
4906308 the other thing we have to pay for is the costs of marketing marketing costs generally are about twice the spend on research and development
4906309 of course pharmaceutical companies make a huge investment into public health when they develop a new medicine
4906310 it costs on average 550m and takes more than 10 years to bring each new treatment to patients
4906311 naturally companies will look to recoup such costs through the final price

4906317 there is no question that asphalt is the more environmentally sustainable pavement of the two napas policy in the past has been to strive for continuous improvement in all aspects of our product that affect the environment and to publicize the benefits of asphalt but not to denigrate the competing pavement type in front of congress however the concrete industry made a number of statements about asphalt and put them into the hearing record we had no choice but to respond with factual information
4906318 napa interprets the intent of acpas testimony as an effort to alter time tested pavement type selection processes which are working well it also seeks to create federal guidelines based on acpas vision of what makes a pavement sustainable and diminish the independence of state dots in pavement type selection
4906319 napa determined that to stay silent in the face of acpas attack might ultimately have proved detrimental to the asphalt industry
4906320 in addition napa opposes any attempt to federalize decisions about what pavement type to choose
4906321 napas position is that local conditions require the existing oversight of the state and local governments to remain in place the asphalt pavement industry is proud to be a partner of the state dots the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto and the federal highway administration fhwa in these agencies quest for continuing improvement in providing pavements that meet the nations needs
4906322 there is no official standard or labeling program to designate cool paving materials and research in this area is in an early stage

4906465 a certain selfishness on my part i was so obsessed with me and the reasons why i might be dissatisfied that i couldnt focus on other people
4906466 i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him
4906467 that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis
4906468 i just dreamed that you gave me a pearl necklace for valentines day what do you think it means
4906469 she does everything backwards just last week i told her to give a man two milligrams of morphine every ten hours she gave him 10 milligrams every two hours he almost died
4906470 earlier this week i told her to give a man an enema every 24 hours she tried to give him 24 enemas in one hour
4906471 i mean i dont know how to tell the difference
4906472 while western europe is turning muslim its christian churches are committing suicide
4906473 the ideological civil war within the west is not just between secularists and religious people it runs straight through the church itself
4906474 in migrants the church has always contemplated the image of christ who said
4906475 the church does not approve of illegal immigration but nor can the church ignore the plight among us of those who are here without legal status we stand in solidarity with you too
4906476 is the place where illegal immigrants are also recognized and welcomed as brothers and sisters
4906477 it is one of the central tasks of christians a constant theme of the old and new testaments to offer hospitality to the exile and the stranger seeing in him and her the face of christ faith in the presence of christ in the migrant leads to a conversion of mind and heart which leads to a renewed spirit of communion
4906478 i deferred to them a year ago and i deferred to them last august
4906479 if there were any signs the administration policy in the middle east was working id defer to them again
4906480 a trap for the innocent and an invitation to the guilty
4906481 jesus said to turn the other cheek so how can we commit an act of violence in response
4906482 why should we throw our lot in with the new iraqi regime when the americans may abandon it any time would it not be better to wait and see who emerges on top in baghdad or whether or not there will be an iraq after the americans have left
4906483 its not cold its all in your weak little minds dont look at me get your frigging eyeballs straight ahead
4906484 its christmas eve so youre gonna file into my chapel when you enter my hatch get those covers off your nasty little gourds and keep your soup coolers shut do you understand
4906485 i know tonight you are thinking about christmas at home
4906486 mental anguish depression physical injuries illness loss of pay and benefits and loss of advancement opportunities
4906487 once is bad luck twice is coincidence three times is enemy action
4906488 look were going to level with you in a way that we havent up to now
4906489 oh sure some of us are more radical than others
4906490 you see despite what youve heard about the conservative case for same sex marriage the more radical argument that love makes a family has played a huge role in the success of the drive for same sex marriage
4906491 and consider the complex families created when three or even four gay men and lesbians combine through say artificial insemination to bear and raise children we want recognition for these sorts of unconventional families too even or especially if such recognition leads to legalized polyamory pretending that certain aspects of the gay community dont exist only weakens our diverse families the way we live is the way we live up to now weve tried to hide it but at last were ready to own up to reality and to push for legal recognition for all types of families even if that expands the definition of marriage until the very idea of marriage itself is stripped of meaning
4906492 committed loving households in which there is more than one conjugal partner
4906493 listen strange women lying in ponds and handing out swords is no basis for a system of government
4906494 what about all the bodies what about all the bombings
4906495 self reflection should be more than a minor consideration if youre serious about personal growth how else am i supposed to make improvements if i dont know where ive gone wrong in the past many people try to ignore past errors but then history repeats itself as we all know
4906496 oh my god what should i pack beach stuff or mountain stuff

4906498 what in the world is wrong with you you think i dont know how to fry a couple of eggs
4906499 i just wanted to show you what it feels like when im driving
4906500 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4906501 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4906502 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4906503 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4906504 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4906505 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4906506 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4906507 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4906508 just taking some time off and let it rest up
4906509 we just want to make sure that he is where he needs to be as we start back on monday
4906510 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4906511 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4906512 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4906513 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4906514 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
4906515 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
4906516 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
4906517 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass
4906518 we hebben de argentijnen heel erg goed aangepakt maar staan wel met lege handen het is heel erg jammer dat we niets van peking gaan zien
4906519 we hebben goed gevoetbald maar daar koop je niets voor de olympische spelen waren iets eenmaligs die maak je nooit meer mee ik had graag in peking iets mee willen krijgen van het olympisch gevoel
4906520 in het begin toonden we te veel respect voor argentini maar na de 1 0 achterstand gingen we vrijuit voetballen het was de bedoeling om naar het olympisch dorp te gaan maar die missie is helaas mislukt
4906521 deze jongens waren fantastisch zij hebben mijn droom mogelijk gemaakt zonder hen was het niet gelukt
4906522 alles bij elkaar van de race met eenhonderdste van een seconde verschil tot aan het wereldrecord van vandaag het is een geweldige ervaring en iets dat me altijd zal bijblijven ik wilde iets doen dat nog nooit iemand anders had gepresteerd dat is gelukt
4906523 het enige wat ik nu even wil is naar mijn moeder toe
4906524 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4906525 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4906526 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4906527 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4906528 remember this whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever sows generously will also reap generously each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver
4906529 the foreclosure prevention act of 2008 was signed by president bush on july 30 2008
4906530 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4906531 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4906532 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4906533 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4906534 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4906535 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4906536 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4906537 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4906538 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4906539 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4906540 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4906541 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4906542 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4906543 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4906544 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4906545 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4906546 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4906547 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4906548 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4906549 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4906550 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4906551 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4906552 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4906553 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4906554 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4906555 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4906556 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4906557 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4906558 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4906559 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4906560 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4906561 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4906562 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4906563 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4906564 saya menafikan dakwaan bahawa saya telah ditaja pas pada pilihan raya kecil permatang pauh
4906565 i dont know what to feel so many emotions so much excitement i just want to see my mum
4906566 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
4906567 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4906568 oh just wondering howve you been and what have you been up to lately
4906569 los residentes de reas bajas tambi n ser an obligados a buscar un refugio m s seguro en este momento las autoridades no ordenar an una evacuaci n general
4906570 u s a u s a lets go phelps u s a u s a
4906571 i dont know what to feel so many emotions so much excitement i just want to see my mum
4906572 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
4906573 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4906574 ive got plenty of time for world records in the future
4906575 im ready to kiss it goodbye if he keeps on doing what hes doing
4906576 i felt myself pulling away from the rest and i could see him slowing down and im still pumping to the line
4906577 i said im going to win the olympic gold medal
4906578 i have 100 percent confidence in myself that i can win the gold and 100 percent belief in my coaches
4906579 bmx is easy for children and adults to access its a very cheap way of getting involved in cycling and its very clear who is the winner whoever crosses the line first
4906580 right now bmx is where my heart is and i will continue to do that until london 2012 after that maybe track cycling or something else
4906581 we had the bases loaded with no outs and again with one out and we didnt score those are big situations and they are magnified when youre not scoring every run becomes crucial if we get one or two more runs wed get a few more wins
4906582 i felt like ive been throwing the ball well the last few starts but a mistake here or there cost me
4906583 today i didnt have any mistakes i feel really strong and healthy and we have only two months left important months too
4906584 im at a loss for words for how i felt out there
4906585 im not sure what happened either my leg cramped or i was protecting it but i felt i couldnt use my leg any more
4906586 it felt like someone was stepping on it but when i turned round there was nobody there it was the same leg as the fracture but it wasnt a sharp pain more a tightening up
4906587 i was trying to achieve the impossible because the amount of running i had done wasnt enough and you cant take short cuts in the marathon
4906588 its not the end well keep fingers crossed for 2012 maybe the olympics wont happen for me but how hold is constantina 38
4906589 maybe my body will hold out i know in london i will have all that support
4906590 maybe if there was less media coverage there would have been more people a lot of people in the community are open about their sexuality but their families are unaware and in cases that family members are aware they do not want their neighbours and relatives to know so a lot of my friends skipped the parade
4906591 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4906592 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4906593 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4906594 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4906595 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4906596 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4906597 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4906598 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4906599 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4906600 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4906601 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4906602 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4906603 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4906604 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4906605 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4906606 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4906607 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4906608 in the war on terrorism intelligence has replaced the cold wars tanks and fighter planes as the primary weapon against an unseen enemy
4906609 could inflict far more damage to national security than soviet spies
4906610 investigators suspect espionage is probable as she produced highly sensitive health hazard documents for toxic compounds and chemical pesticides tehseen also was an expert in parasitology as it relates to public water systems
4906611 it was a great performance at the world half marathon championships in canada everybody said i couldnt run but i showed today what i can do
4906612 we want the neighborhood to look good because it does get a lot of coverage and if the neighborhood looks good attitudes will change about flint
4906613 why are the danes the worlds happiest people american newspaper wants to know
4906614 is it that the people of the united states are not happy
4906615 the only time my family ever sat together was for a sunday meal in denmark its every day
4906616 everything is built for the middle class not the upper class
4906617 i think we are happy because we have the best beer in the world carlsberg
4906618 im quite sure i could do this the rest of my life
4906619 we feel that theres a little bit of a soul in each piece
4906620 remember we have a half year in which its very dark so lighting is important to us
4906621 its really a nice whitewater park with something for everyone
4906622 our cancer rates are going up because the population is getting older but as more australians put on more weight it is going up even quicker said the organisations chief executive professor ian olver
4906623 we need to recognise this now and act on it with tough measures to try to turn this around
4906624 we really dont know what works for obesity so we can borrow from tobacco because that was hugely successful prof olver said
4906625 well a lot of my friends said they enjoyed it and if its any indicator my parents said they hated it so that says something my sister said she loved it but i usually disagree with her is there any moment where i can call a time out and give up on it
4906626 oh the turtle is so cute why are turtles in disney movies always so dumb
4906627 its pretty ambitious of her to ask for a prince when surrounded by talking woodland creatures
4906628 if i were the prince id worry about her talking to animals
4906629 oh thats cool like the olympics but on a smaller scale wait she landed in the sewers
4906630 wait shes getting a step mother and she likes fairy tales i think i can predict the second half of this film massive gun fight
4906631 this is my 2nd favorite working song next to finest work song by rem

4906635 weve all kissed tvs in our time mine was when arsenal won
4906636 giselle what the hell you talking about about bitch you know that whole i came to another country thing now
4906637 ohh girly moment i feel less masculine now how many clothes do they need for one ball im no woman but
4906638 what this is like cloverfield and now its like the rising of voldermort
4906639 i was just thinking how i never ever want to go to a ball like this
4906640 why are apples always poison why not a poison cherry
4906641 wait is it true loves kiss or true loves third base is that in the r rated version
4906642 last year there were 60 qbs that started in the regular season
4906643 unless all 60 are better than me i expect that my career in the nfl will continue
4906644 i am not convinced that i would gain anything from having an agent at this point in my career
4906645 when i visited the packers i felt real good about the opportunity to back up aaron rodgers on a good team
4906646 i just sensed that when it was time to negotiate that there were some unresolved issues that kept them from giving me a market value offer i think that the brett favre situation was in the background while they were dealing with me
4906647 i just was not willing to take the vet minimum and no guaranteed roster spot
4906648 fyi i never said i wanted to start in pittsburgh
4906649 i was encouraged by league personnel to contact the vikings during free agency to gauge their interest
4906650 i had a good conversation with coach brad childress and i have no hard feelings toward the organization
4906651 the trade discussions were initiated by the vikings and some teams during the nfl combine
4906652 once that was exposed i merely pushed to be involved in the discussions since i was representing myself i regret that there was a lack of understanding between the team and me
4906653 the situation had all of the ingredients for a perfect storm i needed to get out from under a long term deal that had no guarantees left they needed a commitment from their quarterback to get to town and learn their new system the fact that i was injured and it was recommended that i rehab in a warm climate only complicated the matter
4906654 we showed him a lot more info than any player has ever seen before how we scout how we measure players statistically
4906655 we just talked about the team how we operate and where we are going and then his performance and place in the future so i would say it was a good meeting in that a it happened and b marian had good input observations and understanding
4906656 sometimes you think how it could be in an eastern system in a more offensive system theres more offense there for sure
4906657 he seemed surprised pleasantly to learn he is among the top scorers in the league right now and doesnt need to go anywhere else to do that
4906658 so only his groins have kept him from being right there which would not change with another team
4906659 they want to make sure theyre getting what theyre paying for because of the high gas prices
4906660 texans are paying record gas prices and when they purchase a gallon of gas they expect to receive a full gallon
4906661 todays enforcement action charges the defendant with shortchanging texas drivers at the pump thanks to a thorough investigation by agriculture commissioner todd staples the office of the attorney general is prepared to hold any wrongdoers accountable for violating the law
4906662 i mean i put the pump in the gas tank and i start pumping
4906663 ive got to be happy with that its disappointing to get so close and get second my heats swim would have won me that but its ok i know i finished with everything i had
4906664 i have got no regrets but jeez it would have been nice to have won this
4906665 im getting a bit older now and ill wait and see how i feel after a nice long break
4906666 i had expectations for the 400m freestyle but this is a great surprise
4906667 i felt good in the first 400m of this race and at the 800m and 900m i started believing that i could win
4906668 it was all calculated i slowed down in the penultimate 100m to save my energy and attack in the final 50m
4906669 fight them the disbelievers allah will punish them by your hands and bring them to disgrace and give you victory over them and he will heal the hearts of those who believe
4906670 the believer is not stung twice by the same hole
4906671 o you who believe fight those disbelievers who are near you and let them find harshness in you and know that allah is with those who keep their duty unto him quran 9 123
4906672 go forth light armed or heavy armed and fight with your wealth and your lives in the way of allah that is better for you if you but knew quran 9 41
4906673 at a cafe on a bright plaza most customers sit back feeling the warmth of the sun enjoying their cold drinks but not tim he barely notices the sun doesnt really taste his coffee for him this corner affords a good view of the city and in the teetering of the passers by in the arc of a hand as she displays tea to an interested gentleman tim hopes to see clues
4906674 that night at the cinema fictitious adventurers lunge implausibly across the screen the audience here is mixed some are patrons of the cafe now sitting excitedly in the plush chairs eager for another new flavor for distraction from the boredom of their easy lives other seats hold fisherman and farm workers hoping to forget their toils and rest their hands
4906675 tim is here too but he is scrutinizing the gloss on the lips on the screen measuring the angle of the plume of a distant helicopter crash he thinks he discerns a message when the cinema closes and most of the audience strolls down the plaza to the south tim goes north
4906676 people like tim seem to live oppositely from the other residents of the city tide and riptide flowing against each other
4906677 tim wants like nothing else to find the princess to know her at last for tim this would be momentous sparking an intense light that embraces the world a light that reveals the secrets long kept from us that illuminates or materializes a final palace where we can exist in peace
4906678 but how would this be perceived by the other residents of the city in the world that flows contrariwise the light would be intense and warm at the beginning but then flicker down to nothing taking the castle with it it would be like burning down the place weve always called home where we played so innocently as children destroying all hope of safety forever
4906679 tim is off on a search to rescue the princess she has been snatched by a horrible and evil monster this happened because tim made a mistake
4906680 not just one he made many mistakes during the time they spent together all those years ago memories of their relationship have become muddled replaced wholesale but one remains clear the princess turning sharply away her braid lashing at him with contempt
4906681 he knows she tried to be forgiving but who can just shrug away a guilty lie a stab in the back such a mistake will change a relationship irreversibly even if we have learned from the mistake and would never repeat it the princesss eyes grew narrower she became more distant
4906682 our world with its rules of causality has trained us to be miserly with forgiveness by forgiving them too readily we can be badly hurt but if weve learned from a mistake and became better for it shouldnt we be rewarded for the learning rather than punished for the mistake
4906683 what if our world worked differently suppose we could tell her i didnt mean what i just said and she would say its okay i understand and she would not turn away and life would really proceed as though we had never said that thing we could remove the damage but still be wiser for the experience
4906684 tim and the princess lounge in the castle garden laughing together giving names to the colorful birds their mistakes are hidden from each other tucked away between the folds of time safe
4906685 all those years ago time had left the princess behind he had kissed her on the neck picked up his travel bag and walked out the door he regrets this to a degree now hes journeying to find her again to show her knows how sad it was but also to tell her how good it was
4906686 for a long time he thought they had been cultivating the perfect relationship he had been fiercely protective reversing all his mistakes so they would not touch her likewise keeping a tight rein on her own mistakes she always pleased him
4906687 but to be fully couched within the comfort of a friend is a mode of existence with severe implications to please you perfectly she must understand you perfectly thus you cannot defy her expectations or escape her reach her benevolence has circumscribed you and your lifes achievements will not reach beyond the map she has drawn
4906688 tim needed to be non manipulable he needed a hope of transcendence he needed sometimes to be immune to the princesss caring touch
4906689 off in the distance tim saw a castle where the flags flutter even when the wind has expired and the bread in the kitchen is always warm a little bit of magic
4906690 visiting his home for a holiday meal tim felt as though he had regressed to those long ago years when he lived under their roof oppressed by their insistence on upholding strange values which to him were meaningless back then bickering would erupt over drops of gravy spilt onto the tablecloth
4906691 escaping tim walked in the cool air toward the university hed attended after moving out of his parents home as he distanced himself from that troubling house he felt the embarrassment of childhood fading into the past but now he stepped into all the insecurities hed felt at the university all the panic of walking a social tightrope
4906692 tim only felt relieved after the whole visit was over sitting back home in the present steeped in contrast he saw how hed improved so much from those old days this improvement day by day takes him ever closer to finding the princess if she exists she must she will transform him and everyone
4906693 he felt on his trip that every place stirs up an emotion and every emotion invokes a memory a time and location so couldnt he find the princess now tonight just by wandering from place to place and noticing how he feels a trail of feelings of awe and inspiration should lead him to that castle in the future her arms enclosing him her scent fills him with excitement creates a moment so strong he can remember it in the past
4906694 immediately tim walked out his door the next morning toward whatever the new day held he felt something like optimism
4906695 she never understood the impulses that drove him never quite felt the intensity that over time chiseled lines into his face she never quite felt close enough to him but he held her as though she were whispered into her ear words that only a soul mate should receive
4906696 over the remnants of dinner they both knew the time had come he would have said i have to go find the princess but he didnt need to giving a final kiss hoisting a travel bag to his shoulder he walked out the door through all the nights that followed she still loved him as though he stayed to comfort her and protect her princess be damned
4906697 perhaps in a perfect world the ring would be a symbol of happiness its a sign of ceaselessness devotion even if he will never find the princess he will always be trying he still will wear the ring
4906698 but the thing makes its presence known it shines out to others like a beacon of warning it makes people slow to approach suspicion distrust interactions are torpedoed before tim can open his mouth
4906699 in time he learns to deal with the others carefully he matches their hesitant pace tracing a soft path through their defenses but this exhausts him and it only works to a limited degree it doesnt get him what he needs
4906700 tim begins to hide the ring in his pocket but he can hardly bear it too long tucked away that part of him might suffocate
4906701 the boy called for the girl to follow him and he took her hand he would protect her they would make their way through this oppressive castle fighting off the creatures made of smoke and doubt escaping to a life of freedom the boy wanted to protect the girl he held her hand or put his arm around her shoulders in a walking embrace to help her feel supported and close to him amid the impersonal throngs of manhattan they turned and made their way toward the canal st subway station and he picked a path through the jostling crowd
4906702 his arm weighed upon her shoulders felt constrictive around her neck
4906703 youre going the wrong way and youre pulling me with you
4906704 he worked his ruler and his compass he inferred he deduced he scrutinized the fall of an apple the twisting of metal orbs hanging from a thread he was searching for the princess and he would not stop until he found her for he was hungry he cut rats into pieces to examine their brains implanted tungsten posts into the skulls of water starved monkeys
4906705 ghostly she stood in front of him and looked into his eyes
4906706 he scrutinized the fall of an apple the twisting of metal orbs hanging from a thread through these clues he would find the princess see her face after an especially fervent night of tinkering he kneeled behind a bunker in the desert he held a piece of welders glass up to his eyes and waited
4906707 on that moment hung eternity time stood still space contracted to a pinpoint it was as though the earth had opened and the skies split one felt as though he had been privileged to witness the birth of the world
4906708 someone else said now we are all sons of bitches
4906709 the candy store everything he wanted was on the opposite side of that pane of glass the store was decorated in bright colors and the scents wafting out drove him crazy he tried to rush for the door or just get closer to the glass but he couldnt she held him back with great strength why would she hold him back how might he break free of her grasp he considered violence
4906710 they had been here before on their daily walks she didnt mind his screams and
4906711 maybe every day thereafter as before she always walked him on a route that passed in front of the candy store
4906712 he cannot say he has understood all of this possibly hes more confused now than ever but all these moments hes contemplated something has occurred the moments feel substantial in his mind like stones kneeling reaching down toward the closest one running his hand across it he finds it smooth and slightly cold
4906713 he tests the stones weight he finds he can lift in and the others too he can fit them together to create a foundation an embankment a castle
4906714 to build a castle of appropriate size he will need a great many stones but what hes got now feels like an acceptable start
4906715 you never know if you have a shot until you see how it unfolds
4906716 when he made that catch and pulled the ball down i breathed a sigh of relief
4906717 i knew they had my back and i kept attacking hitters
4906718 it is imperative that the arroyo government and the kuwait government as the sending and receiving states respectively should conclude first a bilateral agreement respecting the rights of migrant workers as embodied in the international convention on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers and members of their families
4906719 aside from concluding a labor rights agreement the arroyo administration if its truly cares for our ofws should work also for the standardization of ofws salary in order for them also to cope with the fast rising inflation in kuwait and even in the philippines
4906720 there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear for fear has to do with punishment and whoever fears has not been perfected in love we love because he first loved us
4906721 the room i am staying in padang west sumatra has a sign saying qibat hanging from the ceiling i dont know what this means this pen is shitting me hardcore changed better ive decided west sumatra specifically padang is a bit shit this decision has been made on the basis of three 3 considerations 1 my ojek driver a guy who approached me at the airport and told me he could take to where a bus going to medan was running did take me to a bus stop where the bus in fact wasnt running he proceeded to repeatedly ask me if i wanted to stay at his house nggak no was my repeated reply he then asked if he could take a bath at my house ngaak mate a pause he then asked and this is a direct translation if he could enter me at the hotel he then begins rubbing my arm offering me a massage so i think we know where he was going with that i wasnt particularly fazed because he was a very little man say my pre pubescent height circa 1996 and i could have hurt him very badly at least beaten him in an arm wrestle oh look the lights have gone out oh there goes the air conditioning tonight has been a series of blackouts and hot air so happy theres lots of mosquitoes to keep me alert next complaint the hotel rp 125 000 about au 15 for a shitty room i wouldnt pay half that elsewhere i mean i dont have a problem with shitty rooms in fact they enhance my hardcore cred but i dont want to have to pay for the privilege of doing so there was a beautiful indonesian girl asking me at the hotel counter think she worked there asking me where i was going next and if i was going alone sendiri she asks politely hiding what i think is mild confusion and suprise ya sendiri alone i say and my feminist whims kick in because i know its fairly unheard of for any woman to travel alone in these parts indonesian or not she asks me if im a university student nggak i tell her i work in jakarta that im a journalist and my familys back in australia im dribbling on about myself in the genuine hope that it could inspire her as arrogant and contrived as that sounds writing it down im also genuinely aware that my shitty indonesian ramblings are probably doing as much for her feminist awakening as spice girls tell ya what i want what i really really want wika wika wik ah did for mine shes looking at my a bit round eyed now so i do whats really needed i remove my shiny femo nazi badge and have a shower which i needed after clambering around the mountain

4906735 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4906736 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4906737 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4906755 it would be a challenge but if the community wanted it
4906756 we would plan and find the resources to do it

4906764 the sources said that any charges against the guards would likely be brought under the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act which has previously been used to prosecute only the cases referred to the justice department by the defense department for crimes committed by military personnel and contractors overseas

4906766 a federal grand jury has heard testimony from about three dozen witnesses since november including u s and blackwater officials and iraqis according to two of the sources

4906817 should i just go out and get that laptop and read your blog while eating my breakfast
4906818 i understand now the comment on your blog awhile back that if you ask a different producer you will likely get a different answer to the question of whether or not weir was alive or dead you tried to leave some of that ambiguity in the episode do you think weir is alive or dead
4906819 why do we keep betraying the replicators who are sympathetic and or acting
4906820 just checked out the new episode and i noticed a graphics mistake in the atlantis intro

4906824 several years ago someone pointed out to me that george bush almost always pronounces a as a long a instead of a schwa and letting it slide gracefully into the next word
4906825 in trying to sound forceful bush separates his words quite distinctly rather than letting them flow forward and the word
4906826 as other speakers fall into this emphatic separate the words delivery they too start pronouncing the article as ay and consequently losing the need for

4906828 my husband says he cringes when people refer to a movie as a film or confuses whatever with what ever
4906829 so often we hear something like i had two choices shut up or go to jail actually thats only one choice act of choosing with two options or alternatives of course my example is more of an ultimatum than a true choice
4906830 you used the chinese menu to illustrate options i will use a typical surry county vegetable plate where one chooses four vegetables from a number of items pintos fried squash potato salad etc
4906831 lets say there are 10 of those now thats four legitimate choices from among 10 items although we dont think about it thats a surprisingly high number of combinations i would do the math but if i got it wrong youd be inundated by incensed former math or logic majors
4906832 anyway the point is that the number of choices depends upon the number of times one gets to choose not the number of things one has to choose from if i could choose one thing from the national gallery of art it still would be only one choice

4906834 you made me so angry when you called me stupid yesterday you hurt and embarrassed me
4906835 when we were together yesterday i sensed that i was being made fun of and i didnt care for that i felt embarrassed and hurt
4906836 i do not choose to be talked to like this
4906837 i think you really went after me yesterday and i want you to know that i dont like it
4906838 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4906839 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4906840 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4906841 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4906842 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4906843 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4906844 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4906845 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4906846 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4906847 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4906848 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4906849 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4906850 methadone can be important for patients when other drugs dont work
4906851 but unless the doctor has the training and resources to manage the patient properly hes going to get in trouble at a rate thats unacceptable
4906852 actually our goal was 140 000 so we did come short of that we have bills that need to be paid of course so its hard to tell at this point what the net is going to be
4906853 we had 139 survivors who walked in a special lap for the survivors who are honored and the weather was absolutely perfect
4906854 we had 26 teams made up of those 300 usually the teams are anywhere from five to about 15 members sometimes a little bit larger t just depends
4906855 we had 6 000 luminaries its probably a little bit more than last year each one is either in memory for someone who has died or in honor of someone who is a survivor
4906856 they liked it new ulm so much that some of these people are coming back on their own
4906857 it is easier to port a shell than a shell script
4906858 the biggest reason people come here is that were very knowledgeable about birds what they eat what need to nest what they need as far as water features
4906859 i love teaching kids about biodiversity and how everything goes together and how you have to be able to take care of your world around you
4906860 people love to see the bright yellow goldfinch which are on the southern california coast all year we attract them with fresh nyjer seed and a feeder that has attracted to yellow the biggest thing is fresh filler free seed and great feeders
4906861 they bring me pictures of the birds bathing in their new bird bath or their solar fountain all kinds of things like that
4906862 we are a bird feeding solution store we have solutions for squirrels and for people at the beach
4906863 i dont even have a backyard at my house but i have pole feeding systems and feeders and i get all sorts of birds in my yard with water and food its just a little bit of nature that i have and it helps me de stress i love seeing birds hearing them sing in the morning ive got bird feeders in the courtyard and ive got humming bird feeders set up so when i go by a window i see birds and it makes me happy
4906864 the absence of a net is a minor oversight that wont deter us
4906865 i have a fish glove and if necessary a pair of hook cutters
4906866 the last time i did this bats flew from beneath he bridge into my face
4906867 when i tell my friends back home about nights like this spent fishing on a lake they will hardly believe it
4906868 maybe we should find a cabin with lights on and ask

4906870 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration

4906903 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
4906904 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4906905 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
4906906 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

4906910 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4906911 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4906912 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4906913 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4906914 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4906915 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4906916 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4906917 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4906918 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4906919 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4906920 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4906921 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4906922 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4906923 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
4906924 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

4906932 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4906933 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4906934 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar

4906937 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios

4906944 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4906945 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4906946 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4906947 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4906948 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4906949 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4906950 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4906951 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4906952 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4906953 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4906954 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4906955 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4906956 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4906957 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4906958 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4906959 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4906960 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

4906966 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4906967 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4906968 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4906969 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4906970 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4906971 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4906972 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4906973 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

4906998 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4906999 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4907000 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4907001 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4907002 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4907003 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4907004 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4907014 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4907015 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4907016 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4907017 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4907018 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4907019 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4907020 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4907021 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4907022 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4907023 this beautifully illuminated stores beckons you in from the hustle and bustle of amsterdam ave
4907024 the prices changed but we havent fixed the menus yet

4907030 reduced to holding secret gatherings to confess their beliefs in sympathetic company
4907031 it is easier to port a shell than a shell script
4907032 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4907033 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4907034 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4907035 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4907036 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4907037 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4907038 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4907039 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4907040 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4907041 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4907042 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4907043 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4907044 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4907045 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4907046 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4907047 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4907048 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4907049 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4907050 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4907051 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4907052 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4907053 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4907054 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4907055 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4907056 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4907057 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4907058 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4907059 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4907060 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4907061 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4907062 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4907063 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4907064 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4907065 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4907066 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4907067 it was a great opportunity for us to play against a quality opponent
4907068 we started slow but really got it going later in the match
4907069 we had some good opportunities to score late in the game
4907070 the average experience of all u s manufacturing firms over the last two decades is inconsistent with the simple story that all foreign expansions come at the cost of reduced domestic activity
4907071 violent crime more crimes against property more insurance fraud more white collar crime more juvenile crime more drug and alcohol related crime more domestic violence and child abuse and more organized crime
4907072 ill be a little nervous or have some anxiety tomorrow
4907073 but i think if you dont have that there is something wrong with you
4907074 with the greens the way they are i figured i had to shoot 67 or better to have any chance of being near the leaders
4907075 to go through 72 holes without bogeying would have been pretty wishful thinking
4907076 thats while i am having all these surgeries this year
4907077 i dont know what to feel right now there are so many emotions running through my head so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4907078 there is no comparison in the swimming world for what michael has done
4907079 i think years and years down the road well realize more and more how amazing he is and how special he really is
4907080 the term spitzean feat might be a little outdated it might be phelpsean feat now
4907081 im living a dream my son is a starter for the gophers hell have his masters when he finishes up next spring he loves being there its my alma mater i have that jersey in my bedroom i look at it every day
4907082 the guy cranked on my foot and i felt it go
4907083 i tried to play in two more plays and i couldnt move
4907084 i had a why me moment when it first happened
4907085 it was so exciting to go out and just run
4907086 its in the way they walk the way they hold their hands on their hips
4907087 my dad taught me both to punt and to long snap
4907088 im not sure i knew how bad it was hes a strong competitor give him the credit for giving it a try
4907089 i tell you what jack simmons is really looking good
4907090 this camp he looks excellent hes running pain free to have him in the middle of the field is going to be a tremendous plus for us
4907091 it always has been since i was a little kid but im more worried now about how we develop as a football team and im really excited about what i think we can do the level were at right now compared to last year is mind boggling
4907092 i think the main thing is to concentrate on having a great year playing football and having fun
4907093 it is easier to port a shell than a shell script
4907094 the question is how do we reduce the number of abortions
4907095 god knows that i detest slavery but it is an existing evil for which we are not responsible and we must endure it and give it such protection as is guaranteed by the constitution till we can get rid of it without destroying the last hope of free government in the world
4907096 it is easier to port a shell than a shell script
4907097 i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
4907098 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4907099 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4907100 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4907101 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4907102 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4907103 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4907104 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4907105 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4907106 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4907107 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4907108 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4907109 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4907110 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4907111 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4907112 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4907113 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4907114 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4907115 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4907116 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4907117 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4907118 who are open to doing something on the production side
4907119 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4907120 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4907121 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4907122 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4907123 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4907124 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4907125 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4907126 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4907127 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4907128 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4907129 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4907130 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4907131 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4907132 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4907133 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4907134 the concern i have is we had too many long runs against our defense we cant have that
4907135 on the other hand i thought davin pronounced day vin meggett for his second scrimmage had a heck of a scrimmage i thought he ran harder he wasnt as cautious as hes been and he showed what kind of speed he has once he gets out into the open
4907136 i really think that we have three quarterbacks that can play and it wouldnt surprise me if all three of them played during the season
4907137 that wouldnt shock me in the least what we have to do is get one that we can win with and hopefully we can win with all three
4907138 we put him back fielding punts because if we get into a punt safe situation were going to need a secondary guy back there he does it so naturally i thought he had a good run back there on the kickoff i thought he probably should have scored on the pick but he made a good play on that too
4907139 here are my goals here is what ive learned i need to keep me happy and healthy here is how i want to grow and learn
4907140 ive got a day to think about it get some tactics ive got one more chance
4907141 ill probably shed a couple of tears but i need to let it go
4907142 it wasnt for a lack of trying it just wasnt my day
4907143 i think thats been lacking and whenever i take a little time to enjoy the moment i think thats when i do my best
4907144 layers of clay have been discovered in the martian highlands using the mars reconnaissance orbiter the data indicate that liquid water was once widespread on early mars
4907145 could tholins formed in titans atmosphere react with liquid water temporarily exposed by meteor impacts or ice volcanoes to produce potentially probiotic complex organic molecules before the water freezes until this year no one knew
4907146 now laboratory research by catherine neish a graduate student working on her doctorate in planetary science at the university of arizona shows in the journal astrobiology that over a period of days compounds similar to tholins can be hydrolyzed i e react with water at near freezing temperatures
4907147 todays launch successfully lifted off at 7 a m local time at the beginning of our three hour launch window we are very pleased to be a small business partner with lockheed martin on their research and development technology programs by supplying low cost fast turnaround launch operation
4907148 we are extremely pleased to host another launch by up aerospace which continues to set the precedent for safe practical commercial spaceflight at spaceport america
4907149 the aerospace community increasingly understands the benefits offered by spaceport america
4907150 it is easier to port a shell than a shell script
4907151 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4907152 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4907153 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4907154 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4907155 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4907156 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4907157 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4907158 paradesi is an eye opening film this inspirational film is a must see for all those who wish to understand the roots and repercussions of the 1947 partition of the indian sub continent the director should be commended for bringing this controversial subject out in the open
4907159 no one should be punished in their old age for their past mistakes real or perceived paradesi should be required viewing for all fanatical patriots on both sides of india pakistani divide
4907160 the film is a bold effort that rises above narrow politics it focuses on human rights issues especially when they are in reference to ones inalienable right to retain and even regain the citizenship of a country that one was born in
4907161 so far the literature and popular films dealing with the partition of 1947 have focussed on north india while the south remains a kind of unknown terrain this film transposes a bitter reality that even in a uniquely progressive and highly literate state such as kerala xenophobic attitudes and policies can continue to pester innocent individuals
4907162 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
4907163 each cockroach produces 600 babies in their lifetime and we have more than 100 entrants so our success to date is that we are reducing 60 000 cockroaches without using any chemicals at all and thats the beauty of it
4907164 the termite queen is like an egg laying machine so with every queen we get rid of 100 000 termites immediately
4907165 we went out with the soldiers and a lot of them helped us because we know them
4907166 i didnt think we had a winner because a lot of people brought big ones and there were many almost as big as this one is fine but we spent quite a lot of money to get it
4907167 every termite will emit co2 from their gut because when they consume the wood and digest it they get wind
4907168 with every degree the global temperature rises the life cycle of each bug will be shorter the quicker the life cycle the higher the population of pests
4907169 we know very well well not be about to win the war against insects they have been here much longer than us cockroaches were here 350 million years ago
4907170 we used to live plain and simple a wall was a simple brick wall but now we have decorated walls that insects hide behind
4907171 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
4907172 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
4907173 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
4907174 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
4907175 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
4907176 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
4907177 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
4907178 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
4907179 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
4907180 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
4907181 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
4907182 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
4907183 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
4907184 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
4907185 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
4907186 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify

4907202 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
4907203 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
4907204 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
4907205 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
4907206 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
4907207 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
4907208 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
4907209 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
4907210 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
4907211 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
4907212 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
4907213 the fact that this event is even taking place is significant
4907214 it could provide an opportunity for barack obama to make some inroads but i think youll see john mccain stressing his conservative credentials
4907215 usually they go republican the fact that obama is in there with a chance of maybe getting a share of that vote is in some respects a great triumph for him
4907216 to be perfectly blunt its hard to imagine al gore or john kerry doing very well at this kind of a forum but barack obama speaks very movingly about issues of faith and values
4907217 a plan has been hatched to liquidate me and the governor by hired killers because we put in danger the lucrative illegal business of prominent people who are behind the illegal logging activities in the province
4907218 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honouring their word
4907219 russias elite value their ties to europe their shopping and their luxury weekends we should look at the visa regime for russian citizens
4907220 russian armies cant march into other countries while russian shoppers carry on marching into selfridges
4907221 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security

4907259 its the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind and its happening very very fast
4907260 the u s with texas in the lead added more in wind power than the world added in coal power last year
4907261 it is clear that he and i have two very different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4907262 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4907263 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4907264 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
4907265 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
4907266 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
4907267 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4907268 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4907269 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
4907270 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
4907271 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
4907272 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
4907273 global warming obesity and heart disease all figments of al gores imagination
4907274 we used to be young but suddenly were not our thighs have gone wide but we used to be hot wubyah wubyah wubyah
4907275 how i stopped raising my children and started raising h
4907276 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4907277 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4907278 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4907279 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4907280 the share price is very important to a pharmaceutical company
4907281 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4907282 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
4907283 it s good that this has ended happily because 125 miles out in the north sea in the dark its not what you want by way of a ship flooding as you are an awful long way from help
4907284 russias elite value their ties to europe their shopping and their luxury weekends we should look at the visa regime for russian citizens
4907285 russian armies cant march into other countries while russian shoppers carry on marching into selfridges
4907286 russia wants international recognition and respect we must make clear that the path it has chosen leads to isolation and contempt
4907287 david cameron is right to criticise russia but wrong to promise georgia early nato membership
4907288 it is simply not credible for britain and nato to make confetti commitments to protect every nation with the lives of our servicemen and women
4907289 if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the highest earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
4907290 yes protect those on the lowest incomes but also help the hard working middle classes with large mortgage commitments who are neither rich nor poor the people who work long hours for their two holidays a year leisure club membership meals out with family and friends and ability to buy their children nice things
4907291 im here to break the tradition just when u think u have gotten rid of me is when ill be there and ill spread the word across the world about a girl waiting there for me in the end
4907292 we played periods of good footy weve got some players who arent in great form at the moment which makes it hard
4907293 theyve got 22 guys who are prepared to tackle and chase and do all the hard things we certainly havent got anywhere near 22
4907294 paul bevan for consistency over four quarters hes one who really stands out
4907295 hes hungry hes a young kid who has a lot of desire hes a really good competitor he has a good pedigree in terms of his rugby league background
4907296 hes a really good kid and he wants to compete every week and thats the trick in afl footy
4907297 he played on the norm smith medallist and then went to the possible 2008 brownlow medallist so it was a reasonably tough evening for the fella
4907298 i just hope we can get on top of it soon because if we continue to lose games we are a chance of not making the finals at all
4907299 each cockroach produces 600 babies in their lifetime and we have more than 100 entrants so our success to date is that we are reducing 60 000 cockroaches without using any chemicals at all and thats the beauty of it
4907300 the termite queen is like an egg laying machine so with every queen we get rid of 100 000 termites immediately
4907301 we went out with the soldiers and a lot of them helped us because we know them
4907302 i didnt think we had a winner because a lot of people brought big ones and there were many almost as big as this one is fine but we spent quite a lot of money to get it
4907303 every termite will emit co2 from their gut because when they consume the wood and digest it they get wind
4907304 with every degree the global temperature rises the life cycle of each bug will be shorter the quicker the life cycle the higher the population of pests
4907305 we know very well well not be about to win the war against insects they have been here much longer than us cockroaches were here 350 million years ago
4907306 we used to live plain and simple a wall was a simple brick wall but now we have decorated walls that insects hide behind
4907307 let me take him and give him a good education if the lad is anything like his father hell grow to a man you can be proud of
4907308 as the economic slump begins to affect everything from food prices to mortgage repayments this research shows that financial worries are a source of stress for many
4907309 but people are making changes to the way they live like growing their own fruit and vegetables and walking and cycling more
4907310 not only is this evidence that people are adapting well to change but some of their altered habits are actually good for mental health
4907311 for many people particularly the younger generations this may be the first time theyve been surrounded by worrying talk of serious recession
4907312 by spending less people can help themselves avoid serious debt which can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety
4907313 but they need to replace shopping and spending with other activities they enjoy and shouldnt isolate themselves from friends
4907314 a nadie le gusta entrar porque un compa ero se lastime aunque estas son las cosas que tiene el f tbol no
4907315 fue una sensaci n rara apenas not el gesto de oscar me puse muy ansioso ten a que entrar en los minutos finales y en un partido muy dif cil quer a demostrar cuanto antes que estoy apto para darle seguridad a mis compa eros
4907316 para m estar en un juego ol mpico es impagable siempre fui fan tico del b squet mi hermano es jugador profesional incluso por eso haber pasado por la villa ol mpica y conocer a gente como kobe bryant fue incre ble me saqu una foto con l y le avis a mi familia no lo pod an creer eso solo ya hizo que esta experiencia valga la pena
4907317 me vino bien sobre todo para la confianza si bien ya est bamos clasificados sentirme seguro y demostrar que pod a estar a la altura de las circunstancias me fue clave
4907318 nos conocemos bien y s no vamos a negar que existe una rivalidad desde siempre a brasil le queremos ganar siempre como sea y ellos tambi n nos querr n ganar a nosotros es un choque muy especial
4907319 jugu contra ellos en un sudamericano y terminamos 2 a 2 yo s que se dice que nos ganaron varios partidos importantes ltimamente pero en este equipo hay muchos jugadores que han vencido en competiciones juveniles eh
4907320 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4907321 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4907322 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4907323 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4907324 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4907325 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4907326 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4907327 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4907328 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4907329 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4907330 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4907331 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4907332 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
4907333 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
4907334 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
4907335 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
4907336 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
4907337 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
4907338 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
4907339 this gives them an outlet to share and discuss their passion on issues they care about
4907340 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county
4907341 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4907342 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4907343 the response was amazing including letters of thanks being received
4907344 it highlights the need for export market research and development particularly in asia and education of consumers in australia
4907345 passing out of dummy half dropped balls on collision bad passing just a really very poor game skill wise
4907346 it was an a grade game tonight not a first grade game
4907347 defensively were miles ahead of where we were at the start of the year
4907348 thats come through hard work and a great attitude from the players and i guess tonight really showed that and won us the game
4907349 defence won the night and it was great from our boys
4907350 we dropped a little bit of ball and so did they but particularly earlier in the year if we hadve done that we had tries scored against us and tonight we didnt which goes to show the attitude from now compared to then
4907351 im surprised im not sure what the problem was to me thats the sort of thing thats been happening since 1908
4907352 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
4907353 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
4907354 it developed over time im not a natural born leader i was actually a very shy person but i came to understand very quickly that if you let your shyness get in your way youre not going to get very far in any business
4907355 these are people who have been assigned a leadership job but they dont yet understand that theyre running a company now not just a department
4907356 its a disservice to all the money spent by our clients if we can strengthen the creative leaders we might get somewhere
4907357 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4907358 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4907359 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4907360 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4907361 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4907362 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4907363 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4907364 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4907365 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4907366 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4907367 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4907368 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4907369 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4907370 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4907371 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4907372 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
4907373 ellos siempre est n esperando que alguna persona terrible aparezca
4907374 por lo que tienes que asegurarte que ellos piensen que eres inteligente pero no horrible luego intentas parecer fuerte y sexy pero s lo despu s de ser elegante y amable
4907375 estaba pasando apuros en la escuela en t rminos de hacer tonter as y todo sin un perceptible talento
4907376 un amigo me dijo una vez dios m o las cosas que dices y pens imagina las cosas que no digo posiblemente no puedas imaginar lo que es vivir dentro de esta cabeza
4907377 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4907378 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4907379 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4907380 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4907381 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4907382 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4907383 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4907384 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4907385 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4907386 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4907387 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4907388 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4907389 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4907390 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4907391 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4907392 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it
4907393 hi im regis philbin can i buy you a drink
4907394 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
4907395 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4907396 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4907397 i made a few easy mistakes but he played really really solid
4907398 you would probably have to put him as a darkhorse hes someone to watch
4907399 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4907400 this is not a done deal we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4907401 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4907402 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4907403 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4907404 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4907405 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4907406 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4907407 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4907408 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4907409 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4907410 unfortunately today we are looking evil directly in the eye and today this evil is very dangerous for everybody not only for us
4907411 we told the world this is about starting an invasion we screamed to the world stop it
4907412 and the definition of an international mechanism which will be charged with overseeing the implementation of the agreement on the ground
4907413 resulted in the severing of railway links between the east and west of georgia and connections with georgias seaports
4907414 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
4907415 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4907416 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4907417 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4907418 we saw that many of the reactions of the russian army in georgian territory are exceeding the boundaries of international law
4907419 they said are you open for a discussion and i said yes im open
4907420 theyre looking for us to release sonny bill from his contract we are his employer so thats why they came to us as opposed to the nrl
4907421 any resolution is still not going to be ideal for the bulldogs or our game
4907422 but certainly i think people want to see an end to it
4907423 the decision to leave our club one year into a five year deal has had some significant ramifications on and off the field
4907424 its affected our recruitment its affecting our players currently its affecting our sponsorship and it will affect our attendances
4907425 its a big decision and all those things will be taken into account when we start talking with them
4907426 this is the first time weve heard from toulon its the first time weve heard from any of sonnys people since he made his departure and left our club seven games from the end of the season
4907427 were happy to talk weve said that all the way along and well open up some discussions now
4907428 i see it far from that in fact i see it as the opposite
4907429 the sanctity of a contract remains until such time as people are willing to sit down and talk about a release
4907430 hes made it very clear in both the public and private arenas that he wants to play rugby union
4907431 it says if you sign a contract you need to uphold your end and if you dont there are some serious consequences
4907432 youve got to remember that overseas in other sports this is a daily occurrence in premier league soccer there is a transfer system operating we dont have that in the nrl maybe this is the first step in looking at that
4907433 it would be very complicated to introduce a transfer system into rugby union and rugby league
4907434 and ive said from day one i dont expect very many players to be prepared to walk out on their team mates mid season or mid contract
4907435 todays news is encouraging it shows sonny bill shouldnt play in defiance of a court order
4907436 hubiera querido darle m s a m xico pero me siento satisfecha porque luch con todo
4907437 que luch con todo mi coraz n le ech todas las ganas y el esfuerzo y el lugar que hice se lo dedico
4907438 el marat n es una prueba dif cil y no se termina hasta que cruzas la meta
4907439 no es el primer marat n pero s el primer ol mpico y s que todas las que tomamos la salida salimos a buscar lo mismo que es una medalla ol mpica
4907440 heimerdinger has young stepping up in the pocket more to throw off of his front foot
4907441 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4907442 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4907443 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4907444 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4907445 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4907446 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4907447 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4907448 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4907449 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4907450 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4907451 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4907452 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4907453 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4907454 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4907455 the 65 000 new donors to the obama campaign demonstrate just how strongly the american people are looking to fundamentally change business as usual in washington
4907456 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4907457 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4907458 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4907459 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4907460 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4907461 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4907462 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4907463 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4907464 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4907465 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change
4907466 this is the challenge for politicians and diplomats strategic military hostility and confrontation must remain a thing of the past
4907467 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4907468 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4907469 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4907470 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4907471 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4907472 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4907473 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4907474 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4907475 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4907476 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4907477 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4907478 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4907479 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4907480 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4907481 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4907482 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4907483 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4907484 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4907485 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4907486 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4907487 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4907488 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4907489 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4907490 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4907491 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4907492 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4907493 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4907494 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4907495 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4907496 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4907497 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4907498 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4907499 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4907500 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4907501 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4907502 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4907503 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4907504 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4907505 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4907506 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4907507 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4907508 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4907509 nama heskey sendiri sebenarnya baru diikutsertakan menyusul cederanya dean ashton dari west ham
4907510 ini adalah partai penting karena saya berharap mendapat jawaban yang saya harapkan bisa dicapai para pemain
4907511 i went on the record earlier this year to say that terry wallace would coach the richmond football club for his full term
4907512 theres been major speculation about our senior coach and its started to get beyond a joke in recent times
4907513 before judging we should understand and if we understand there is a good chance that we do not judge anymore
4907514 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4907515 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4907516 negando las declaraciones del campe n del mundo jackie stewart quien sugiri que el segundo piloto de mclaren debe hacer m s para ayudar a su compa ero de escuder a a ganar el mundial de f rmula uno
4907517 la sugerencia de que para conseguir el campeonato del mundo depende de la ayuda de heikki presupone que su labor es conducir para ayudar a lewis
4907518 en las que un piloto tiene que ayudar a su compa ero est n
4907519 tiene que ser ayudado por su compa ero de equipo
4907520 l y heikki son buenos compa eros pero ambos son muy competitivos individualmente y toman sus propias decisiones
4907521 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4907522 you just left this in the back of my car
4907523 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4907524 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
4907525 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4907526 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4907527 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4907528 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4907529 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4907530 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4907531 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4907532 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4907533 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4907534 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4907535 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4907536 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4907537 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4907538 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4907539 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4907540 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4907541 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4907542 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4907543 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4907544 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4907545 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4907546 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4907547 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4907548 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4907549 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4907550 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4907551 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4907552 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4907553 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4907554 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4907555 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4907556 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4907557 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4907558 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
4907559 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
4907560 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
4907561 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
4907562 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
4907563 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
4907564 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
4907565 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
4907566 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
4907567 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
4907568 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
4907569 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
4907570 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
4907571 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
4907572 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
4907573 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4907574 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4907575 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4907576 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4907577 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4907578 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4907579 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4907580 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4907581 fourth in the olympic games is just not good enough fourth is not the place to come my time would have got me a medal in the individual and im gutted i didnt do it
4907582 im trying not to be upset its been a great experience being here
4907583 buy a stack of discs get a copy of his dvds or a membership to pptv and burn to disc all you can afford and get them out to everyone you can
4907584 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4907585 this is not a done deal we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4907586 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4907587 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4907588 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4907589 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4907590 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4907591 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4907592 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4907593 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4907594 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4907595 unfortunately today we are looking evil directly in the eye and today this evil is very dangerous for everybody not only for us
4907596 we told the world this is about starting an invasion we screamed to the world stop it
4907597 and the definition of an international mechanism which will be charged with overseeing the implementation of the agreement on the ground
4907598 resulted in the severing of railway links between the east and west of georgia and connections with georgias seaports
4907599 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
4907600 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4907601 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4907602 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4907603 we saw that many of the reactions of the russian army in georgian territory are exceeding the boundaries of international law
4907604 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4907605 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4907606 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4907607 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4907608 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4907609 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4907610 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4907611 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4907612 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4907613 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4907614 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4907615 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4907616 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4907617 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4907618 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4907619 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4907620 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4907621 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4907622 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4907623 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4907624 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4907625 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4907626 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4907627 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4907628 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4907629 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4907630 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4907631 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4907632 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4907633 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4907634 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4907635 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4907636 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4907637 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4907638 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4907639 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4907640 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4907641 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4907642 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4907643 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4907644 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4907645 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4907646 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4907647 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4907648 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4907649 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4907650 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4907651 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4907652 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4907653 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4907654 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4907655 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4907656 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4907657 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4907658 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4907659 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4907660 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4907661 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4907662 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4907663 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4907664 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4907665 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
4907666 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
4907667 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
4907668 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
4907669 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
4907670 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
4907671 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
4907672 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
4907673 a school is a factory is a poem is a prison is academia is boredom with flashes of panic
4907674 the mens shot put is going to set the tone for team usa on the first day of competition
4907675 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4907676 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4907677 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4907678 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4907679 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4907680 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4907681 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4907682 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4907683 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

4907696 we deplore the courts ruling in this case which violates an extensive body of international law on human rights and religious freedom to which egypt has long been a party
4907697 since this was the last avenue of appeal in this particular case the courts decision threatens to make non citizens of an entire religious community solely on the basis of religious belief
4907698 our hope now is that the public debate over this issue will cause the egyptian government to rectify its discriminatory policies
4907699 this could be accomplished either by allowing bah s to be listed on government documents by abolishing the religious affiliation listing entirely or simply by allowing the word other to be legally included on state identification forms

4907714 los tres puntos tienen que quedar en casa y m s en esta clase de partido agreg en la medida que aseguremos puntos de local y rescatemos otros afuera las oportunidades de pelear arriba van a crecer
4907715 no importa igual va a ser duro como una final
4907716 rivoira nos inculc que muchos partidos se definen con pelota parada hay que estar muy concentrados no dormirse lo importante es tener revancha r pido
4907717 para m con la prueba que tenemos colectada hasta ahora y con la que hay en el expediente alcanza para demostrar que mi defendido no tiene vinculaci n con este caso la desaparici n del ex senador provincial guillermo vargas aignasse en 1976 entonces prolongar las cosas y que mi defendido muera en estas idas y vueltas no tiene sentido
4907718 yo ejerzo su defensa t cnica pero l ejerce la material estar en una sala contigua no le asegura lo segundo as como en ning n momento intent eludir la justicia l quer a estar a la par m a pero su salud no se lo permite si est al lado l puede decir este testigo miente esto no es as en caso contrario no tengo qui n me aclare esto porque es una verdad hist rica que s lo l la conoce
4907719 de alguna manera esta es la apertura de la celebraci n del mes de nuestra patrona la virgen de la merced cuya festividad tiene lugar el 24 setiembre la particularidad de esta convocatoria es que se ha pedido a las parroquias a las capillas a los colegios y a otras instituciones que cada comunidad peregrine con la imagen de la advocaci n de la virgen a la cual rinden culto son much simas las advocaciones de la virgen la merced del valle luj n f tima guadalupe del carmen del socorro etc tera pero lo importante es recordar que mar a es una sola es nuestra madre y ello expresa que los cristianos los hijos de dios formamos una familia
4907720 queremos que todos juntos como iglesia hagamos esta especie de camino que nos conduce a mar a y a jes s mar a que est de nuestro lado nos lleva a su hijo por eso el centro de la celebraci n va a ser la eucarist a
4907721 se est calculando un aumento que puede andar en el 8 lo que estoy viendo es qu suceder con los m s humildes
4907722 of course we are concerned that if there is such a tank in existence we would like to know as a community
4907723 to say we are going to hold off on any other ordinances abdicates the role we were elected to do
4907724 existing ordinances and regulatory practices and develops a streamlined approach to development and business regulation
4907725 i grew up in the 60s with the idea it was the most wonderful place in the world to live
4907726 one of the first mass cultural images of the south and of course its not the african american story at all its not the southern story at all
4907727 i felt like the lord brought us to shelby to do battle with our own pasts and with our own stories about our pasts
4907728 is a kind of a commitment that many generations of southerners black and white have made to try to have a multiracial democracy and try to redeem the u s constitution and the declaration of independence into more than words
4907729 who were caught between doing what was the right thing to do in terms of their faith and keeping bread on their table and having a job
4907730 that part of the story had a real wonderful resonance to me and i knew that having lived through that i could tell that story
4907731 in this story its human beings who are flawed imperfect and caught in a hard history and they are grappling to make sense of it and to fix what cannot be fixed
4907732 its not about saints and heroes but its about ordinary people like ourselves
4907733 we really have to tell the story and tell it in a way that is correct that is truthful and honest
4907734 hollywood has a way sometimes to kind of give people what they think people are ready for rather than what the truth is
4907735 it was never my intention to show the south at its best
4907736 i continually surprised myself in terms of the depth of the anger from the black community the depth of the frustration
4907737 am i bringing all that to the screen i guarantee you im not and i feel like i didnt make this movie to be the white director making the black experience but i am a director telling a story and that i can do
4907738 i hope that what we are telling is a kind of human history in which we can see the faces of people that we know and that we are and that as we struggle to find meaning in our past that well manage to find hope in our future
4907739 i just remember she was a beautiful woman a sweet woman
4907740 i remember her saying im not afraid hes not going to hurt me
4907741 some alleged victims have told us they were pressured very hard to testify and intimidated and even threatened to testify and were told that if they didnt tell the same stories theyd already told the ladies up there at safe on seven they could be charged with perjury my point is i think routinely theyre told they better stick to the same story on the witness stand
4907742 we dont threaten and we dont intimidate we tell them possibilities
4907743 we know hes just setting her up and sometimes its vice versa
4907744 arent you afraid of him why do you suddenly think youre secure she said im not afraid of him its only when he drinks
4907745 is the only baby sitter that i have i need my job as of now i feel that im no longer in danger from my husband
4907746 it is their choice and it has to be their choice but how do we guide them to make the right choice
4907747 what i should have worked harder at is convincing her not to let him back into the house and not to let him back into her kids life but we have only so much time with these women
4907748 this thing is about sharing world records just dont happen it takes a team
4907749 its been full of highs and lows we have a great history in this event since athens
4907750 i have never been part of this event and to be the anchor is such an honour i really just wanted to bring it home and hold on for the girls
4907751 i gave it my best shot and im thinking maybe i shouldnt have filed my nails last night
4907752 first a baby learns to crawl then it walks slowly then finally it runs
4907753 here is my credit card give me what i want and it damn well better be just the way i want it
4907754 yes i am sir now will you please return my dentist tools
4907755 sure doc im sorry about that can i buy you and your lady friend a drink
4907756 i just cant seem to get anything done during the day
4907757 celebrating the 1st anniversary of world bank kdc in silliman university
4907758 sustaining the development and growth of aquaculture through the application of cost efficient farming technologies as an answer to the future national food security
4907759 shame and psalm 107 dealt with toxic shame and the goodness and loyal love of god in
4907760 we are looking at organising a mega familiarisation tour for foreign journalists to see for themselves what we have to offer
4907761 saucy savvy for clients and colleagues from an industry veteran
4907762 yeah thats like going into a singles bar and thinking what should matter is what a good person i am
4907763 as the economic slump begins to affect everything from food prices to mortgage repayments this research shows that financial worries are a source of stress for many
4907764 but people are making changes to the way they live like growing their own fruit and vegetables and walking and cycling more
4907765 not only is this evidence that people are adapting well to change but some of their altered habits are actually good for mental health
4907766 for many people particularly the younger generations this may be the first time theyve been surrounded by worrying talk of serious recession
4907767 by spending less people can help themselves avoid serious debt which can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety
4907768 but they need to replace shopping and spending with other activities they enjoy and shouldnt isolate themselves from friends
4907769 they always seem to be happy because theyre there and theyve done their best
4907770 theyre watching how the olympians behave more than how they perform
4907771 theyre just looking for cues in how to behave as an adult
4907772 what people are seeing at the olympics are the things that kids who are really in swimming see all the time
4907773 the way phelps touched the wall the other night that happens a lot of times and sometimes we only have a stopwatch its not always the kid who touches first who wins
4907774 its good for young kids to see how other swimmers behave in these situations
4907775 i like to smile when i win and i dont smile when i lose
4907776 phelps is great but in some ways i think the kids are surprised hes gotten all of the attention
4907777 they say to me there are so many really good swimmers out there they should all get some attention
4907778 its also a stalled undertaking and its a secret undertaking this hasnt been a process so far that we can have a lot of confidence in
4907779 nothing like this has ever been done and we have to really be careful because were dealing with peoples lives were dealing with peoples privacy
4907780 even though curtis is not here to witness that i think for his familys sake to know because they always believed in him
4907781 i was convinced 33 years ago that he was innocent
4907782 the dna analysis has led us to a new suspect but this does not exonerate moore
4907783 this was the one holding her down or holding a gun to her head while the other two had their way
4907784 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty
4907785 sen ted stevens r alaska quickly turned a 5 000 florida condo investment into a profit of more than 100 000 in a questionable transaction that federal prosecutors would like to introduce as evidence at his trial next month on charges that he lied on financial disclosure forms
4907786 stevens was indicted last month by a federal grand jury on charges of not reporting on senate financial disclosure forms that he accepted more than 250 000 in gifts and home renovations from executives of veco a now defunct oil services company in alaska
4907787 vecos former chief executive bill allen pleaded guilty last year to bribing public officials and is expected to testify at stevenss trial
4907788 alleging that he lied to conceal his acceptance of 250 000 in gifts and services from a now defunct alaska oil services and construction company aka veco
4907789 if they truly believed the shipments were in violation of the law
4907790 that products for military use arent being sold to countries that might have an improper and criminal use for the product
4907791 it is with no options and great sadness that we will cease operations please keep the families whose lives depended on jenny lee bakery in your thoughts and prayers

4907793 get a life youre here to get away from work
4907794 your paycheck is not going as far you have to start making decisions about how you allocate cash to your primary costs
4907795 i think this is the inflation that is hurting consumers very badly
4907796 a second half surge could come at the expense of what will be purchased next year
4907797 those interested in buying equipment in the first quarter will push it back to the fourth quarter for the tax advantage
4907798 the real strategic imperative that is driving corporate behavior is upstream and downstream acquisitions
4907799 they want to be able to control margins they dont want to be whipsawed by anybody
4907800 we just thought it was like eating your seed corn
4907801 you really have to put yourself back in those days everybody was scrambling for cash
4907802 i dont think theyre going to buy a coke plant without having the metallurgical coal to run it
4907803 what well find is cases where someone used to get a poor or barely acceptable signal that they now get a perfect picture and likewise people who got a poor picture before will get nothing in digital
4907804 it could be in a few situations that for a few moments the picture is perfect and then disappears and then comes back perfect
4907805 we cant simplify it down to the level wed all like it to be simplified to
4907806 the whole system is predicated on having a large outdoor antenna
4907807 this is my fraternitys fundraiser i always wanted to do it but i couldnt take summers off from working

4907812 i didnt know any of the team members starting out but i made a lot of great friends
4907813 journey of hope riders usually plan reunions and were talking about having one at a ride across iowa
4907814 we like to provide pittsburgh favorites like isalys chipped ham kielbasa and sauerkraut haluski and eatn park smiley cookies
4907815 the men from the journey of hope come through here every year and they are awesome
4907816 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4907817 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4907818 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4907819 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4907820 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4907821 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4907822 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4907823 tudo aconteceu na hora certa fiz o que tinha que fazer fui com a juliana at o final n o me arrependo de nada ningu m tinha o direito de tirar o sonho dela de ir para as olimp adas porque foi algo que ela conquistou com muito trabalho

4907837 se controla reduciendo el circulante o a trav s de la inversi n este gobierno est empe ado en la inversi n
4907838 it was something to believe in it was him saying we can do this
4907839 it was uplifting and it was for good not harm
4907840 i let the students know that unless they try they wont know what they can do
4907841 and i want to encourage them to be lifelong learners
4907842 john was selected because of his classroom teaching experience and his ability to design curriculum materials
4907843 he was an outstanding participant and i would be happy to work with him again
4907844 im trying to keep abreast of all the news and whatever i learn i try to filter down to the students
4907845 the catch is to make them see that it affects them
4907846 but lately there is a heightened concern they see the melting of the polar icecaps and the polar bears disappearing
4907847 it was a challenge and i was tired by the end of it
4907848 heres what i try to tell them pay attention to what is going on around you its what you dont know thats going to kill you
4907849 i dont say it to shock and awe them but because its important and theres so much to learn
4907850 he absolutely was the most positive minded man that ive ever known
4907851 his friends thought he was crazy and wanted to know why he didnt just sit back and relax
4907852 but he wasnt content with just sitting back and doing nothing
4907853 he helped a few of his nieces and nephews go to college and paid their tuition one of them went to law school hes now a lawyer
4907854 he was a mentor to so many people people who were in need
4907855 before it escalated to physical fighting he used to say that papas lap was big enough for everyone
4907856 they gave us a love of traveling the world and respect for other cultures
4907857 it was actually a brass duck but they called it the golden goose
4907858 he took an interest in anything you were interested in
4907859 backcountry pennsylvania the lost world of the agrarian democracy of revolutionary america
4907860 we spend a year planning for this and its nice to see your work come to fruition to see all the people all the kids everyone having a good time
4907861 we are very very careful about how we spend the limited money we do get
4907862 people see what we have how great a park it is and it encourages them to come back
4907863 this is one of butlers biggest events and whats exciting is that it is really becoming a destination event
4907864 the attendance is proof that people are really coming out
4907865 the fair policy is to ensure that goods donated at this store remain in this store
4907866 this is going to be the model of all of our stores
4907867 that kept me coming back because it was more fun
4907868 if i dont go in there as much that means im not buying as much
4907869 this is why zoning codes were implemented in the first place to protect property values and public welfare
4907870 nobody wants to take the bull by the horns and do whats right
4907871 why have hearings when you arent going to do a thing about this
4907872 chris took this boat from potential success to proven success
4907873 it was challenge taking the crew from shipyard status to the pointy end of the spear on a deployment and instilling in them the desire to succeed
4907874 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4907875 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4907876 if they truly believed the shipments were in violation of the law
4907877 that products for military use arent being sold to countries that might have an improper and criminal use for the product
4907878 it was a work of agony i would rather had rowed the ocean again
4907879 the way i actually got through it was by setting a few hours aside each day and i would write then forget about it and that would keep my conscience clear
4907880 each day no progress was made at all but over the week it was
4907881 i listened to stories about people in a worse off situation
4907882 the most dull things were interesting but in saying that time still goes quite slowly
4907883 we were looking out for dark shapes and listening for that double bass sound
4907884 being separated from the boat is what causes the nightmares now
4907885 theres a simplicity in life out there you have one focus
4907886 people say it must be really hard rowing the ocean but its not you have no option either row or dont
4907887 that we had gone unnaturally fast to catch up with them
4907888 up to the start of the race more or less they were just really good rowers they are very strong physically
4907889 everything was competitive it was afterwards with the protest that they kind of stepped out a bit
4907890 in some ways it would not have been the same race without them
4907891 we owe a lot to them for the experience it just gouged every scrap of effort and ability out of me
4907892 if it hadnt have been for them i wouldnt have found those depths
4907893 theres a funny trophy its a model of a turtle its quite small
4907894 in the book theres a transformation from business person to dropout to finding a purpose in life to just absolute focus and perseverance through all that
4907895 i feel like i can do w hat i want nothing seems like a long wa y any more
4907896 meu pior pecado foi o ego smo durante minha juventude experimentei drogas bebi fiz tudo isso porque s pensava em mim mesmo pela minha incapacidade em me concentrar nos demais
4907897 sou uma pessoa muito imperfeita mas acho que aquilo foi minha maior falha moral
4907898 voc rico se ganha mais de us 250 mil por ano todos devemos entender que a educa o as estradas os servi os n o s o de gra a todos devemos colaborar

4907905 we want essentially the same as everyone else to get around we dont want anything out of the ordinary we want the same things thats equal access
4907906 ive worked for cranberry for eight years and this is how we have accomplished most of our projects
4907907 thats been the key to our success story and it doesnt surprise me at all
4907908 i think people will like the way its laid out
4907909 this was our first time applying for these grants and we did extremely well
4907910 if the students are studying edgar allen poe for example the teacher can bring video streaming on him right into the classroom
4907911 we have to change the way we teach because students have changed the way they learn you cant stand in front of a group of students anymore and lecture it doesnt work
4907912 youre looking at a future of not even having textbooks having everything online
4907913 we will come up with an implementation plan with the superintendent and technology department
4907914 the superintendent and the board have been great in showing their support for these grants
4907915 you provide an experience for the students and it helps with the transition into higher education
4907916 this is a serial rapist and vicious murderer who tore apart countless lives during his crime spree
4907917 they are required to demonstrate to the department that they have planned for the most effective technologies for removing hazardous pollutants from the emissions
4907918 we are continually looking for ways to tweak our system to better our controls but the technology in my opinion will stay the same
4907919 i have the luxury of using a very deep voice
4907920 i dont really want to be in robinson township my whole life
4907921 i think most americans would look at all those japanese faces and say thats too bad a lot of japanese people died but you get one american face and they might feel a little more of a connection
4907922 a date with the lonesome lady a hiroshima pow returns
4907923 i have attempted to contact her several times without success
4907924 i guess she felt that you married for life and that was it
4907925 quite a few planes got shot down on that mission over shanghai when we flew out we knew that there were planes that wouldnt come back
4907926 he seemed to always have a cup of coffee in his hand
4907927 it wasnt until i got back to the states that i put two and two together and realized that i had been in hiroshima
4907928 i thought that when i was first taken out to tokyo that i would be the unlucky one
4907929 she was unique she was in the forefront of women in jewish education at that time
4907930 she was very intense and she was very dedicated to her students
4907931 she tried to bring out in her students the best they could offer
4907932 she really loved her occupation and dedicated her life to that
4907933 were going after people who are persuadable people who may be likely obama supporters sporadic voters undecideds
4907934 we persuade we mobilize and we register thats what we do
4907935 when you get to the big four year presidential election the old patterns kick in
4907936 but it was clear what warner was doing and he held down votes which would have automatically gone to republicans can obama do that i dont know
4907937 the military vote is the most fascinating aspect of this thing
4907938 there is an enormous amount of ambivalence about iraq among people there they feel abused jacked around they never know when a loved one is coming home or not thats going to be a factor and mccain may suffer as a result
4907939 john mccain is loved by the military in this state
4907940 he understands the way we think obama is not going to win in virginia because he hasnt done anything he has no experience
4907941 but thats because we havent put the obama signs up yet
4907942 were sick of being jerked around by the oligarchs cartels and dictatorships
4907943 are like going back to the carter era all it did was make us more dependent on foreign oil
4907944 obviously sen obama is putting an awful lot of money into virginia both on the ground and on television and it is a state that has elected democrats recently
4907945 but its one we take very seriously and one we think still leans for us and one we will fight for every single day
4907946 its really remarkable how extremely popular mr mark warner is
4907947 both mr obama and mr warner are going to washington to change it
4907948 that we intend to fight for every vote were fighting everywhere
4907949 obama can carry virginia but it wont be the state that puts him over the top
4907950 other larger national forces will have to be in play for obama to win virginia wont do it for him
4907951 he is a cultural candidate hes a harvard guy not a down and dirty guy hell take the college towns the african americans the urban affluents but he wont take harry hunter he cant even bowl
4907952 a month ago i would have said im voting for obama but now im not sure
4907953 i voted for bush twice and im disappointed he doesnt seem to be engaged
4907954 does obama have the experience this business with russia and georgia made me think about that at this point i just dont know
4907955 am i crazy for wondering if the geeks at penndot are crazy or are all these construction projects their idea of fun specifically im referring to the fact that all three mainline roads have work going on at the same time parkway east parkway west and parkway north
4907956 you cant say that pennbotch doesnt have a sense of humor specifically the lane closure on route 30 near greensburg coinciding with the opening of steelers training camp at st vincent college
4907957 last weekend there were construction delays on the parkway west in robinson which were noted ahead of time what i was not prepared for was an additional inbound traffic jam at carnegie where two workers doing some patch work had traffic backed up in single file for a mile was this scheduled and publicized
4907958 it took us 45 minutes to get from robinson to the i 79 interchange and i noted a lot of cars were exiting on i 79 south to avoid heavy one lane traffic we didnt know what was causing the delay nor where the issue was without some idea of the location of the issue and impact i was unable to make an informed decision
4907959 this is a large construction season and it can be difficult to encapsulate everything we are doing in the media
4907960 when i saw the truck i thought it was for 10 families i couldnt believe it was all for us
4907961 this ministry has been the phoenix in my own personal life
4907962 through all those 18 surgeries and the years that went by getting through them my constant prayer was god just show me what i can do in the physical condition im in to serve you and help people
4907963 for two months i had this conversation with god i said excuse me but this isnt a safe neighborhood cant you send a big male christian down the street instead of me i kept bringing that to gods attention by his grace he ignored me
4907964 our parents couldnt help us and they were really happy that we were in a country where people help when there is a need
4907965 its a great way for middle and upper class people to recycle furniture we are able to give them a tax write off
4907966 we believe its really gods grace in their life that delivered them from sleeping on the floor we want to give credit to our ceo jesus we dont want to appear like were just a nice group of people we are but thats not what motivates us to do this
4907967 it makes them feel like theyre normal it makes them feel they have a home and that theyre not just squatting someplace theres no longer that feeling that were going to move someplace else next month
4907968 it was like christmas they were bouncing up and down the neighbors came over to see and helped unload the mattress
4907969 i was crying when those beds came it was a real blessing
4907970 a lot of the families on the north side are related to each other but over a period of years the kids got disconnected
4907971 were trying to introduce the little ones to each other then by the time they are 12 or 13 theyll know each other as friends
4907972 we got to get all these kids back in sync with each other
4907973 we have to get our young people back in church instead of trying to make fast money by killing each other
4907974 i hate teenagers they are unreliable of course im only a dog what do i know
4907975 scott has that rare combination of great editorial instinct and design sensitivity that fits right in at ultrabland having him on our creative team will be a great advantage for us and our clients
4907976 it shapes up to be a very good democratic year this could be one of those change elections i call them tectonic
4907977 i use the ipod pretty much the whole way between cities anyway
4907978 its just the convenience of being able to turn it on whenever wherever you like
4907979 the more friends u have on myspace the more popular and k00l u r lulz so im just gunna add every1 and not talk to them
4907980 i grew up in a generation in virginia when darrell green was a situational return man of the washington redskins
4907981 when he went back there it kind of electrified the crowd hopefully we have a vision of maybe having that with santonio
4907982 i think thats what kind of makes him who he is
4907983 both guys i thought played well well continue to work both i think its important we get a true evaluation of the position by allowing justin to continue to work with the first group and get some cohesion things squared away some communication some silent count issues
4907984 hes just been experiencing some discomfort with his groin hell be ok
4907985 it was non contact i was just planting and trying to cut on it
4907986 it gave way i knew it the second it happened
4907987 would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of constitution
4907988 although i dont think theres any doubt about his intellectual brilliance
4907989 all things of grace and beauty such that one holds them to ones heart have a common provenance in pain
4907990 we do want to have a long term relationship with brett
4907991 he will always be a packer and hes very important to this organization
4907992 the more i rest the more i take care of my ankle and take care of myself then ill be closer to 100 percent if im not 100 then ill be 95 96
4907993 hes been out there two days and hes run some routes and done some individual work
4907994 thats pretty much what hes done its a step in the right direction
4907995 druck why dont you just buy the yankees and turn this thing around
4907996 he spent much of his childhood in richmond building little miniature golf courses in the woods
4907997 he takes whats going on in the world and distills it
4907998 you ever see a skinny guy drinking a diet coke
4907999 if i had stuck with that stand im sure i would have made a lot more money than i made otherwise
4908000 there should be a new word for how private he is
4908001 he doesnt need to be the center of attention he doesnt want to be the center of attention
4908002 there is absolutely nothing that i think could have stan leave this private lifestyle that he has led and expose himself to the public eye except for the pittsburgh steelers
4908003 i was working literally around the clock then and druck would come over a couple days a week late
4908004 well run him again tomorrow hopefully well get him out there to practice on tuesday
4908005 we just got casey back last week and were hoping we can get troy back pretty soon
4908006 the thing was they wanted him to kind of rest it and he wanted to be back so bad he pushed it a little too hard in rehab
4908007 the reason we are able to do the things we do so well is his ability to disguise and be athletic enough to get where he has to be
4908008 i think also from a psyche standpoint and preparation standpoint for offenses hes a guy you have to prepare for there are probably only a few guys in the league on defense you have to scheme for and i think troys one of those guys and that helps us out a lot
4908009 when you play opposing offenses they really have to account for him and take note where he is at all times he does so many positive things out there for the secondary and the defense just the chemistry he brings to the table he makes so many plays from a coverage standpoint blitzing and turnovers
4908010 maybe a guy like me with a hamstring i could do it but with the way troy plays so explosive so many quick movements within the box and constantly fighting off blockers and stuff like that he needs to be at full health
4908011 sometimes hell scare you because youll feel like where he is he cant get to where hes supposed to be
4908012 if youd have told me wed be such good friends by this point i wouldnt have believed it because he barely spoke to me the first few weeks i was here
4908013 but hes cool he doesnt have to tell me what hes doing he knows that whatever he does ill figure out what it is and ill do the opposite to make sure the defense fits
4908014 sometimes troy will point and you have to know what the point means sometime hell give you a signal behind his back and you have to know what that means sometimes he wont do anything and you have to figure that out too
4908015 every year you have a different mix we have different guys in that huddle than we had last year and each guy has to get a feel for how each guy fits and thats always something thats better to have practice at more is better
4908016 whats the last thing that you do before you play a show in front of 100k people
4908017 we shot 45 percent from the 3 and we shot close to 80 from the free throw line so thats a plus if we can do that
4908018 we know were going to defend we know were going to get fast break points but when we can shoot the ball from the outside like that and shoot free throws well its going to be tough to beat us
4908019 it was something for us personally to say where do we measure up with the champions
4908020 my man gave me the ball i had to take the layup
4908021 they wanted to make a statement in this game playing against us and they did
4908022 they sent a message to everybody in the tournament they didnt do it before and now everybody knows that theyre for real and theyre very serious about this
4908023 theres no way hell do it hes got to swim 17 races against the best in the world its impossible
4908024 a program that could be best described as waynes world meets the early 90s east village on the way to having holes drilled in your skull
4908025 solving big problems are not going to be easy we are all going to think about how we using things energy wise
4908026 i studied the film and i was always amazed on a lot of plays it was really me
4908027 it wasnt the offensive line not getting a block or anything like that or anything they were doing really it was really me kind of hurting myself
4908028 i was able to take a lot from those tapes
4908029 just being more patient and learning to play up the gut more
4908030 having been in the construction industry for over 30 years i have always had to rely on a bookcase of printed indexes to find products and suppliers and so it was clear that there was a huge gap in the online market for this information time is valuable and what differentiates the company from other similar websites is the clear set of accurate and relevant results we provide every time
4908031 i believe this website is an invaluable tool for the industry at large i need to provide detailed specifications on a daily basis and the product index provides an excellent resource for this work what puts the company ahead of other online reference sites are the additional sections particularly the tradesmen and contractors directory links to local authority planning control departments and trade associations
4908032 if a guy uses that he loves you or likes you a whole heck of a lot
4908033 a breezy writing style and a cool mix of tidbits
4908034 i was clapping and telling him what a great job he did
4908035 he was giving me his best and i didnt know it
4908036 physical education shouldnt be something you look back on with dread
4908037 we are trying to take away all the roadblocks and show that everybody can reach a level of physical fitness
4908038 a wise girl kisses but doesnt love listens but doesnt believe and leaves before she is left
4908039 siyal ayi nyesel ga dateng upacara barusan temen ngabarin kalo ada kejadian seru
4908040 if i could tell the world just one thing it would be that were all okay
4908041 if you are naked with someone the only thing he should be thinking about is how unbelievably lucky he is to be honored by your nakedness
4908042 95 of what is said about me is entirely untrue
4908043 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4908044 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4908045 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4908046 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4908047 each cockroach produces 600 babies in their lifetime and we have more than 100 entrants so our success to date is that we are reducing 60 000 cockroaches without using any chemicals at all and thats the beauty of it
4908048 the termite queen is like an egg laying machine so with every queen we get rid of 100 000 termites immediately
4908049 we went out with the soldiers and a lot of them helped us because we know them
4908050 i didnt think we had a winner because a lot of people brought big ones and there were many almost as big as this one is fine but we spent quite a lot of money to get it
4908051 every termite will emit co2 from their gut because when they consume the wood and digest it they get wind
4908052 with every degree the global temperature rises the life cycle of each bug will be shorter the quicker the life cycle the higher the population of pests
4908053 we know very well well not be about to win the war against insects they have been here much longer than us cockroaches were here 350 million years ago
4908054 we used to live plain and simple a wall was a simple brick wall but now we have decorated walls that insects hide behind
4908055 rap music was a government ploy to convince black people to kill each other and keep them in the ghetto
4908056 no leeloo listen to me i know youre very tired
4908057 a real vacation i swear just you and me but if you dont do something right now were all going to die
4908058 whats the use of saving life when you see what you do with it
4908059 youre right youre right but there are somethings very nice things worth saving beautiful things
4908060 so there is no use for me other than this

4908068 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4908069 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4908070 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4908071 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4908072 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4908073 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4908074 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4908075 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change
4908076 this is the challenge for politicians and diplomats strategic military hostility and confrontation must remain a thing of the past
4908077 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight

4908088 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4908089 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4908090 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4908091 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4908092 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4908093 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4908094 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4908095 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4908096 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4908097 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4908098 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4908099 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4908100 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4908101 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4908102 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4908103 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4908104 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4908105 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4908106 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4908107 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4908108 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4908109 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4908110 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4908111 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4908112 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4908113 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4908114 from the initial checkup i say that none of the babies have any sort of deformities or incomplete organs
4908115 we thought about an abortion but then we felt its religiously forbidden
4908116 i have another project based on the life of comedian bill hicks which is going from treatment to draft stage with kiwi writer mark staufer

4908118 i was panicking during the meet because i didnt feel good whatsoever and it showed i just didnt feel myself
4908119 luckily tomorrow is a brand new day and we start at zero again thats a blessing for me
4908120 its my last meet ever so i have absolutely nothing to lose and i think just knowing that may relax me
4908121 after that dive i knew i would have to fight hard to qualify and i thought of him its a natural instinct for me just to think of him when im struggling and i did
4908122 she looked like the tin man before dorothy gave him the oil her joints were rusty she just couldnt move tonight
4908123 i dont know what the anxiety was maybe it was just the fact this was the mid step between the preliminaries and the final and all kinds of anxiety crept up in there but i was really pleased to see her push through
4908124 if blythe dives well she will be right on the cusp i think shell be right there
4908125 a year ago she was still trying to land in the pool with every dive i think youre going to see her consistently among the top six pretty soon
4908126 im happy about everything im only 16 years old and in the top 13 in the world so everythings okay i think

4908136 our duty is to act decisively and make sure we understand what it is like to cope with rising food fuel and utility bills
4908137 if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the highest earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
4908138 yes protect those on the lowest incomes but also help the hard working middle classes with large mortgage commitments who are neither rich nor poor the people who work long hours for their two holidays a year leisure club membership meals out with family and friends and ability to buy their children nice things
4908139 they say they have taken off all 13 and they are all safe and well
4908140 it s good that this has ended happily because 125 miles out in the north sea in the dark its not what you want by way of a ship flooding as you are an awful long way from help
4908141 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4908142 the share price is very important to a pharmaceutical company
4908143 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4908144 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
4908145 i was trying to achieve the impossible i guess the amount of running ive done coming in wasnt enough
4908146 cardiovascularly i felt comfortable but my legs had gone my calf went first then it went up the entire leg and it felt like i was running on one leg but i didnt do all that work for nothing its just really frustrating
4908147 i was going to the finish line no matter what i did all the hard work and it feels frustrating because cardiovascularly i dont feel like ive run i tried to do the right things in the race tried to go after constantina but my legs werent there
4908148 we have got to that stage in the investigation it is now a strong possibility we are much closer than we were
4908149 this year some kids were able to express things for the first time
4908150 we will be gone at the end of the year
4908151 the public at large really does think why havent people moved on
4908152 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4908153 its the land its not just dirt and soil mens lives are in it
4908154 i think personally that the roots of today are in the past
4908155 understanding why things unfolded the way they did helps us understand why things happen today
4908156 i am determined to celebrate this occasion despite all the hardships such as heat and security concerns
4908157 i feel that the situation is better now because i notice that there is more security i am happy to be here today
4908158 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4908159 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4908160 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4908161 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4908162 this is a planning took where all things are going
4908163 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4908164 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4908165 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4908166 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4908167 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4908168 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4908169 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4908170 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4908171 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4908172 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

4908186 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4908187 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4908188 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4908189 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4908190 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4908191 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4908192 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4908193 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4908194 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4908195 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4908196 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation
4908197 i have a kilo of cocaine in my glove box
4908198 i would rather have sex 7 times in one night
4908199 you know la when you are dating in country like malaysia theres not much choice of activities outdoor the gals are afraid of sunburnt going to cinema is still the cheapest and logical option
4908200 i think the reason we have so much in common is because we both comes from a small town
4908201 too bad i did not meet you much earlier before you met your fianc e
4908202 well to tell you frankly tonite when i went to the cinema with you the joy was multiplied
4908203 so what are you trying to imply we could still go to the cinemas after im married
4908204 i hate you so much because you make me like you
4908205 for other evidences of the quick fix pre packaged church we need go no further than the average christian bookstore where most of the stock is likely to be of this kind there are how to books on every imaginable topic including titles claiming to be able to teach us the ten steps to spiritual maturity or how to be a successful parent in sixty minutes while anyone looking for curriculum materials for christian education is faced with a bewildering choice all of them claiming to offer biblical truth and changed lifestyles in even more easily accessible bite sized chunks than their competitors many churches are expending inordinate amounts of energy to ensure that their worship by which they invariably mean singing or what some call music ministry is carefully programmed and regulated alongside this there is a corresponding focus on appointing people to ever more narrowly defined ministry positions building up extensive programs and ensuring that we have the right size of team to meet projected needs in such a context pre packaged church can easily seem to be an attractive option somebody else does the thinking for you predigests it and serves it up in an efficient manner it is the spiritual equivalent of fast food and unlike the home prepared meal it requires no preparation no cleaning up afterwards and no involvement in cooking it but to continue the analogy fast food comes in only very limited selections and the novelty of those wears off and who wants to eat burgers for every meal then the majority of people look elsewhere even if they do not seek out establishments that are paid up members of the growing international slow food movement churches where everything is pre packaged can often thrive for awhile but eventually they too lose their appeal
4908206 ah irwing you made a cock up there cricket is a team sport you idiot
4908207 we happen to be good in only individual sports you cannot generalize the entire country based on that you half wit
4908208 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4908209 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4908210 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4908211 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4908212 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4908213 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
4908214 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4908215 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4908216 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4908217 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4908218 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4908219 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4908220 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4908221 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4908222 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4908223 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4908224 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4908225 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4908226 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4908227 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4908228 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4908229 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4908230 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4908231 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4908232 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4908233 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4908234 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4908235 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4908236 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4908237 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4908238 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4908239 a convicted sexual felon should not be able to live next door to your college student
4908240 theyre living away from home for the first time theyre staying out late i know theyre drinking we need to ensure their safety
4908241 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4908242 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs

4908245 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4908246 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4908247 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4908248 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4908249 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4908250 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4908251 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4908252 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4908253 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4908254 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4908255 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4908256 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4908257 you could hear them screaming but there was nothing you could do

4908267 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4908268 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4908269 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4908270 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4908271 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4908272 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4908273 president musharraf is confident about defending himself in the parliament and defeating the charge sheet easily because whatever he did he did in the interest of the country and for the nation
4908274 never indulges in the politics of revenge as it wants a stable pakistan and a sustainable democracy in the country
4908275 one is bush and the antipathy towards him the second is iraq and the antipathy towards the war and the third is obama who has attracted a fervor that is very unusual in our politics
4908276 wenn wir ein besseres side out gehabt h tten w re mehr drin gewesen
4908277 nat rlich gew hnt man sich auch an so einen erfolg und meine freude ist daher auch nicht mehr so gro wie nach meinem ersten gold ber die 100 meter
4908278 ich mache jetzt erst einmal urlaub und werde dann sehen welche ziele ich mir noch stecken m chte jetzt lasse ich erst einmal die seele baumeln und werde in mich hineinf hlen wie ich mich weiter motivieren kann
4908279 ich habe s mtliche zweifel an meiner leistungsst rke mit ihr aufgearbeitet ich war schon immer sehr leistungsstark nur im kopf hat es nicht gestimmt wenn man auf dem startblock steht und immer denkt die anderen sind schneller dann kann es einfach nicht klappen
4908280 wir haben einfach auch einmal einige einheiten weniger gemacht daf r habe ich mehr im mentalen bereich gearbeitet und au erhalb des wassers
4908281 ich wei gar nicht was ich f hlen soll so viele emotionen so viel freude
4908282 diese spiele waren wie eine achterbahnfahrt bei der es nur aufw rts ging es hat riesenspa gemacht

4908288 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
4908289 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4908290 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4908291 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4908292 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4908293 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4908294 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4908295 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4908296 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4908297 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4908298 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4908299 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4908300 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4908301 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4908302 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4908303 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4908304 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4908305 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4908306 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4908307 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4908308 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4908309 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4908310 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4908311 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4908312 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4908313 it shapes up to be a very good democratic year this could be one of those change elections i call them tectonic
4908314 anybody of my stature and experience would recognize what i recognized
4908315 but i dont think thats what they really wanted its fixable the question is do they want it done and i really question whether they want it done theyre more concerned with staying out of the newspaper than doing the right thing
4908316 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4908317 all these guys out here are my brothers and its hard to know youre not going to come back out and go to battle with them
4908318 its so tough when a young man like brad has been in your program for three years and given so much of himself then he gets it taken away just like that
4908319 i hurt and i hurt for him one of the toughest things about this job is having that kind of situation happen to such a great kid
4908320 i could be paralyzed the doctors told me if i continued to play it could potentially have crippled me and i would be in a wheelchair were just lucky we caught it when we did
4908321 for them to come together and want to show support for me like that i cant love anybody any more than i love these guys
4908322 we had a bad quarter we know all of our competitors had good quarters so obviously it doesnt have anything to do with our market we made these mistakes and this is what were doing about them
4908323 year to date our raw material and energy costs are up about 350 million
4908324 i dont believe that theyve ever gone up at this kind of rate over such a short period of time
4908325 we have very diverse businesses and some markets are more capable of taking price increases than others
4908326 you really cant afford not to raise prices on everything you really dont have any choice
4908327 as much power as we use its always a big factor for us
4908328 weve been very good about keeping our rate increases small
4908329 but if its too large an increase wed have to put a utility rate raise on our users
4908330 compounded over the course of the year thats a substantial increase in energy costs
4908331 its incorporated into every piece of our maintenance work every piece of our facility work
4908332 its been a good thing for us that weve started doing it before some of these recent spikes in energy costs
4908333 its going to be focused on energy efficiency and ways that we can reduce energy consumption on campus
4908334 as energy costs increase were going to do everything we can to reduce the cost of consumption its something that weve been thinking about for a long time
4908335 moms you are doing a great job your baby loves you you will figure it all out and while you might not see it now things will get better just push through love your baby love your husband and love yourself it will all come together soon i promise
4908336 the bean didnt like insert product here my little guy just couldnt have lived without it
4908337 tucked between the river and the railroad so parking can be tight
4908338 left unchecked theyll eat up all tax revenues within 45 years
4908339 man that looks pretty good i think i want that
4908340 i was told it was like christmas all over again because they got to open up all their school belongings and unpack and see what they had
4908341 i know when we have our first bad weather it will probably be the scariest time for the teachers and the students when we do when it starts getting dark outside kids are going to be anxious
4908342 safety is a very important issue in stuttgart along with academics we want to focus on students feeling safe to come to school
4908343 24 podr a estar cada vez m s cerca de tener una versi n cinematogr fica
4908344 of course everyone chooses as a natural priority to enjoy peace joy and love by helping to find quickly share and positively act upon evidence about healthy and safe food drink and environment
4908345 im excited its been a long summer a lot of talks going on these last few weeks
4908346 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4908347 i think that he can be called the best olympian of all time more so not because he has more gold medals than anybody but in the way hes handled himself and in the way hes actually won under a tremendous amount of pressure
4908348 i always wondered what my feelings would be im ecstatic
4908349 somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps
4908350 im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4908351 remember to keep looking for those little clues in the universe
4908352 outside a handful of majors engineering and some of the sciences a bachelors degree tells an employer nothing except that the applicant has a certain amount of intellectual ability and perseverance even a degree in a vocational major like business administration can mean anything from a solid base of knowledge to four years of barely remembered gut courses
4908353 its my first elvis week im a little ashamed to say that but it is
4908354 we watched it on the computer last year and i finally said i have to be part of that
4908355 but when we come down here we rarely see people we know yall need to come out
4908356 i have a velvet elvis but because of the rain we couldnt bring out all of our good stuff
4908357 i tell them he ate breakfast at 5 oclock in the afternoon but then hed eat dinner at 1 oclock at night
4908358 we always had a meat loaf cooked just in case he wanted it if he didnt want meat loaf then we knew to give him roast beef he liked soul food
4908359 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4908360 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4908361 our challenge is to take the scholarship and make it enjoyable to a readership that enjoys history
4908362 i would say generally speaking that scholars would have no interest at all
4908363 what it ends up being is something that laypersons find helpful or would think it would be helpful any biblical studies expert worth their salt would not have much interest in this at all except as kind of a curiosity
4908364 it was very common in antiquity to attribute ones own writings to the most important historians in the past
4908365 it happens not just in the bible socrates certainly didnt say everything plato quotes him as saying
4908366 part of the problem and to me one of the flaws is the assumption that this bible is working with that narrative is the primary genre of literature in the bible that just isnt true
4908367 its like you would attach a pack of cigarettes with a warning label from the surgeon general
4908368 well this bible should have a warning from the theologian general or something this bible may be harmful to your spiritual health
4908369 the bible can be intimidating for people and the chronology can help people put the timeline together in their minds
4908370 we try to put our bible studies now in context of when things occur
4908371 it would give people i think a greater sense of how things were laid out in that way
4908372 impossibile non pensare allaltro match ma alla fine tutto andr come deve
4908373 e chiaro che avremo un pensiero anche per quello che accade sullaltro campo ma io sono convinto che sar una partita veritiera
4908374 in quel caso cerano due squadre che avevano tutto da guadagnare da un pareggio stavolta sarebbe una sola
4908375 dopo i gol che ci hanno rifilato a tutte e due dice penso che lolanda sarebbe felice di rincontrare noi o la francia
4908376 io penso che sia vero esattamente il contrario risponde ancora buffon se la romania ha fatto bene finora anche perch non aveva nulla da perdere mentre ora sentir una grossa pressione per lolanda invece giocare serena sar un elemento di forza
4908377 solo noi italiani aggiunge scherzando abbiamo bisogno di avere lacqua alla gola per dare il meglio
4908378 un altro sarebbe duro da digerire ma non credo sar cos
4908379 questanno ricorda ho rosicato gi abbastanza speriamo sia finito il tempo dei rosicamenti e mi rosicherebbe molto vincere e veder vincere la romania ma forse ancor di pi vedere che lolanda non d il via libera ai rumeni ma che noi non riusciamo a battere la francia
4908380 e una partita da dentro o fuori sottolinea dove tutto quello che accaduto prima si azzera ma credo che litalia arriva con il conforto di quanto fatto di buono contro la romania mentre la francia dovr ricompattarsi dopo un 4 1 molto duro e questo per noi potrebbe essere un piccolo vantaggio
4908381 ho scritto sul mio blog che prima di parlare deve contare fino a cinque mi sono preso questa libert perch so di potermela prendere siamo vicini di autobus e di tavola a pranzo e cena lui il primo a sapere questa cosa ma il suo comportamento encomiabile sia con i compagni che con il mister anche il fatto al momento di entrare in campo non abbia cercato il numero ad effetto o che si sia incaponito nei dribbling facendo invece cose semplici un altro segno di maturazione in un torneo come questo se cerchi il numero a tutti i costi rischi solo di fare brutta figura
4908382 che hanno lottato fino allultimo secondo per provare a vincere e sono usciti dal campo con la casacca molto sudata
4908383 questo uno sport che d e prende in corea and come and e poi a berlino abbiamo vinto in portogallo siamo usciti con 5 punti ora ci sta che magari passiamo con due
4908384 dobbiamo chiedere scusa agli italiani stata la partita peggiore dellitalia degli ultimi 12 anni
4908385 con il mister dice il portiere ne abbiamo parlato ma non c stato bisogno di chiarire lui ha capito benissimo la sincerit e lo spirito con cui ho detto quelle cose io sono convinto che per quanto visto sin ad oggi se anche con la francia daremo il massimo alla fine saranno gli italiani a ringraziarci anche in caso di eliminazione

4908392 im happy with the way this first game this first chance to play went
4908393 i felt like i played average at best but its a start and you have to start somewhere
4908394 i will take a few 4 yard carries like i had tonight
4908395 i ran with some toughness ive had to stay patient through the whole process and im still trying to make all the effort over the last year pay off
4908396 its too early to say how long the body had been in the water and a post mortem examination will be carried out tomorrow
4908397 at this stage there is no information as to how he got to be where he was found or why he was in the area
4908398 the sexual power and domination that the female wields over the male is amazing so easily had by any woman choosing to use her gifts to her advantage so easily used to dominate the male beyond just sexual situations and such an easy was to enjoy yourself at the expense of those meant to serve female domination
4908399 i like reading femdom stories that have a personal feel to them
4908400 mccain is not the stranger to technology some think him to be mccain is now asking supporters to stump for him on blogs republican web 2 0 consultant david all was effluent with praise for this outreach calling it smart and unique mccains blogger outreach section has a handy list of political blogs which might be interested in hearing about mccain such as the dailykos crooks and liars and think progress you can even report your posts to the campaign and receive points for your success though the page doesnt say what exactly the points are good for
4908401 i was so much more eloquent well informed and wiser than anyone else i knew
4908402 would have felt very much at home in the medium

4908405 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4908406 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4908407 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4908408 mo has the ability to space the floor hes shown himself to be a good shooter
4908409 i like him hes a competitive player that can make big shots and one of those guys that is capable of rising to important times and obviously we want to be playing in those times
4908410 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him
4908411 i think this is a move to be able to get a talented young 25 year old point guard that can be part of the future
4908412 we want him back and hope we can reach a common ground
4908413 good job honey im proud of you for eating so much of your lunch youre great

4908417 what is written in the law how do you understand it
4908418 love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul with all your strength and with all your mind and love your neighbor as yourself

4908420 what is written in the law how do you understand it

4908422 you have answered correctly do this and you will live
4908423 hey you know what they great thign about being at the bottom of a hill is the only place left to go is up
4908424 therefore having been justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god and not only that but we also glory in tribulations knowing that tribulation produces perseverance and perseverance produces character and character produces hope now hope does not disappoint because the love of god has been poured out in our hearts by the holy spirit who was given to us for when we were still without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly
4908425 big heavy red wines like most zinfandels are not suited to the cold
4908426 a lot of the people who are coming i dont know well enough to know their wine habits they may not care at all i just dont know
4908427 the findings show a lot of individual change but not a lot of broad trends
4908428 most people go to a place of worship thats a different size but theres no strong trend toward finding smaller congregations or larger ones theres also a lot of change in worship styles but not a big overall trend toward going someplace more contemporary or more traditional
4908429 with the rise of megachurches over the past few decades and the increase in the use of contemporary forms of worship such as rock music drama or the folk mass two common concerns are that traditional forms of worship are dying out and that small churches may become a vanishing breed there has been a slight trend toward more contemporary worship styles among people who switch where they worship but certainly not a wholesale move away from traditional styles
4908430 and there has been just as much movement toward smaller congregations as toward larger ones
4908431 observers may worry about people leaving small congregations and going to the megachurches but they need to realize there are about as many people moving down in size as moving up
4908432 the two of us find ourselves looking each other in the eye and wondering what the heck the other one is going to do next

4908438 can astrology fortune telling and psychic and paranormal pursuits be called science and can such non mainstream areas can bring some benefits to our humankid
4908439 i think stevens cheating in the kings glory title tournament
4908440 then why was his match at the last show against jacobi james jacobi suffered mild concussions after his debut match you and steven couldve made it worse what makes it so bad is that a couple of other superstars are out on servere concussions why would he want to add jacobi to the list
4908441 tonight his opponent is the winner out of josh and jeremy and that match is a handicap 2 on1 match with you as his partner
4908442 hes just cheating so that he can have a shot at the kings glory title at blessed beyond measure
4908443 joe steven is abusing his power as chairman of the board to take you out of the title picture so he can have a clean shot for the championship
4908444 joe you have a match befor you help him win his match
4908445 steven is doing this so that he can have the best canidate for his kings glory championship
4908446 yes i trust his judgment it was his judgment that gave you a shot at the esther championship if it wasnt for him making the eshter title match a triple threat match you would not have had a shot because you lost your first match it wouldve been amanda vs alicia so yes i trust him
4908447 joe our stable is called jesus ruff rydaz and this is cwe church wrestling entertainment at the last show you were booed because of what steven did that shouldnt happen our stable has jesus in the name and we wrestle in the church and you were booed
4908448 he is not doing anything wrong you will see i will have a shot at the kings glory championship and my title match will be against a worthy opponent if that opponent is steven so be it it will make things easier for me to become the next kings glory champion
4908449 it has come to my attention that i have no opponent for tonight in the semi final round
4908450 so i have picked 2 men to duke it out for that final spot it will be josh andretti vs jeremy hunter the winner faces me and joe in a 2 on 1 handicap match in the main event good luck to both men
4908451 the following semi final kings glory title tournament match will be a hardcore match thus barring lisa from ringside
4908452 well buddy it looks like its me and you for the kings glory championship
4908453 i know but something has got me a little twisted

4908460 when i first walked into the room i thought that the masters spirit was still here now i see that it is not i came prepared to mourn but upon seeing everyone here wailing at the top of their lungs i realized that this was all wrong this is ignoring the natural course of things
4908461 the master came because it was his time when it was time for him to leave he left if we ourselves are also content to follow the natural flow there would be no room for grief this is truly freedom from bondage when the wood burns the wood itself is consumed to where it goes we cannot say

4908507 our string quartets alone have doubled if not tripled within the last two years
4908508 las vegas is fast becoming an elegant city to be married in and that means more string quartets
4908509 las vegas wedding music will never gouge couples to make a buck just because this is las vegas
4908510 we want to promote live music so we keep our prices as low as possible any string quartet hired for a wedding should cost less than 1 000 for a few hours of performing and if the quartet is only for the ceremony it should cost less than 800
4908511 its easier for wedding coordinators to use the same dj for every wedding so they dont have to bother finding a band
4908512 so many times they state that a string quartet will cost a lot more because of the time they will end up putting in to find that string quartet they often take a cut off the musicians price because they have to work to find the perfect band
4908513 those who come to me are the brides and grooms who truly know that nothing compares to live music for their wedding
4908514 no matter what djs offer they can never offer the same benefits that a live string quartet offers

4908530 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4908531 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4908532 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4908533 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4908534 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4908535 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4908536 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4908537 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change

4908573 kitab kitab ilahi seperti juga tubuh tuhan sendiri selalu dihormati oleh gereja yang terutama dalam liturgi suci tiada hentinya menyambut roti kehidupan dari meja sabda allah maupun tubuh kristus dan menyajikannya kepada umat beriman
4908574 mempersatukan umat yang berhimpun dan mempersiapkan mereka supaya dapat mendengarkan sabda allah dengan penuh perhatian dan merayakan ekaristi dengan layak
4908575 dalam segala kegiatan dan gerakan setiap kali kami datang maupun pergi saat mengenakan sepatu saat mandi saat makan saat menyalakan lilin saat berbaring saat duduk dalam segala apapun yang kami lakukan kami menandai dahi kami dengan tanda salib
4908576 pada hari tuhan berkumpullah bersama memecah mecahkan roti dan mengucap syukur setelah mengakukan dosa dosamu agar kurban persembahanmu kudus
4908577 saya mengaku berasal dari sekitar abad kedelapan tetapi confiteor yang kita serukan sekarang pada dasarnya berasal dari misa yang diajarkan oleh paus st pius v thn 1570
4908578 tidak ada seorangpun yang datang kepada bapa kalau tidak melalui aku
4908579 agar santapan sabda allah dihidangkan secara lebih melimpah kepada umat beriman hendaklah khazanah harta alkitab dibuka lebih lebar sehingga dalam kurun waktu beberapa tahun bagian bagian penting kitab suci dibacakan kepada umat
4908580 homili sebagai bagian liturgi sendiri sangat dianjurkan di situ hendaknya sepanjang tahun liturgi diuraikan misteri misteri iman dan kaidah kaidah hidup kristiani berdasarkan teks kitab suci
4908581 aku menasihatkan naikkanlah permohonan doa syafaat dan ucapan syukur untuk semua orang untuk raja raja dan untuk semua pembesar
4908582 ia mengambilnya melambungkan pujian dan syukur kepada bapa semesta alam atas nama putera dan roh kudus dan menyampaikan ucapan terima kasih karena kami dianggap layak menerima anugerah anugerah ini dari nya
4908583 siapa yang mempunyai milik dan kehendak baik memberi sesuai dengan kemampuannya apa yang ia kehendaki dan apa yang dikumpulkan diserahkan kepada pemimpin dengan itu ia membantu yatim piatu dan janda atau mereka yang karena sakit atau karena salah satu alasan membutuhkannya para narapidana dan orang asing yang ada dalam jemaat singkatnya ia adalah pemelihara untuk semua orang yang berada dalam kesusahan
4908584 dengan misteri air dan anggur ini semoga kita beroleh bagian dalam keilahian kristus yang merendahkan diri dengan ambil bagian dalam kemanusiaan kita
4908585 ya tuhan bersihkanlah aku dari kesalahanku dan cucilah aku dari dosaku
4908586 bapa melalui kristus dalam roh kudus untuk segala karya nya untuk penciptaan penebusan dan pengudusan
4908587 karena roti dan anggur ini sesuai dengan satu ungkapan lama di ekaristikan kita menamakan makanan ini ekaristi seorang pun tidak boleh mengambil bagian dalamnya kecuali orang yang mengakui ajaran kita sebagai yang benar telah menerima pembaptisan untuk pengampunan dosa dan kelahiran kembali dan hidup sesuai dengan petunjuk kristus
4908588 maka dari itu gereja dengan susah payah berusaha jangan sampai umat beriman menghadiri misteri iman itu sebagai orang luar atau penonton yang bisu melainkan supaya melalui upacara dan doa doa memahami misteri itu dengan baik dan ikut serta penuh khidmat dan secara aktif hendaknya mereka rela diajar oleh sabda allah disegarkan oleh santapan tubuh tuhan bersyukur kepada allah hendaknya sambil mempersembahkan hosti yang tak bernoda bukan saja melalui tangan imam melainkan juga bersama dengannya mereka belajar mempersembahkan diri dari hari ke hari berkat perantaraan kristus makin penuh dipersatukan dengan allah dan antar mereka sendiri sehingga akhirnya allah menjadi segalanya dalam semua

4908607 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
4908608 moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth
4908609 unfortunately mr gores movie contains many very serious incorrect claims which no informed honest scientist could endorse
4908610 the campaign to severely ration hydrocarbon energy technology has now been markedly expanded

4908683 las medidas que proponen son las mismas de siempre pero la verdadera cuesti n de esta conferencia es la forma en que se proponen controlar las pol ticas vinculadas a la alimentaci n y el agro
4908684 hay una convicci n general sobre la falta de conocimiento sobre el impacto real de los biocombustibles en la alimentaci n y el ambiente
4908685 por eso la asamblea acept que se necesita un profundo programa de investigaci n sobre el uso de los biocombustibles para medir los peligros y determinar la sustentabilidad de esa fuente de energ a

4908689 tenemos un problema casi psiqui trico respecto del petr leo y de pemex yo no quiero cambiarle sus sentimientos respecto del petr leo a nadie pero es el momento de atrevernos a desafiar un poco los principios que nos imponen nuestros tab es petroleros porque no corresponden con la realidad
4908690 no podemos evitar nuestras tradiciones no podemos evitar el pacto constitucional no somos un pa s de ciudadanos universales
4908691 si los fines que acordamos democr ticamente exigen un cambio constitucional llev moslo a cabo la constituci n es una decisi n nuestra no es el producto de un acto divino tomar el articulado constitucional como si se tratara de escritura sagrada es renunciar al ejercicio de nuestra soberan a democr tica es imponernos restricciones propias de una sociedad dogm tica

4908694 finalmente ser n los legisladores lo que decidan cualquier cambio legal en pemex y hasta ahora ellos mantienen posiciones irreductibles pese a que han escuchado argumentos variados y v lidos en los debates
4908695 debatir los asuntos petroleros no es como hacer matem ticas donde todos obtenemos las mismas respuestas en nuestro caso es imposible llegar a un consenso por lo que se ve cada vez m s dif cil que pueda definirse una reforma petrolera de gran calado
4908696 podemos empezar hoy mismo ir cancelando por inconstitucionales todos los contratos que pemex ha celebrado con terceros firmas privadas
4908697 si mir ramos con m s frialdad el problema de la materia prima y el problema de la empresa quiz s podr amos encontrar soluciones m s efectivas pero vamos construyendo en torno al petr leo una mitolog a nacionalista de tal tama o que nos impide incluso pensar libremente el tema

4908717 when it happened it was like someone was stepping on my chest that was the last thing i remember
4908718 now we have a big game against omaha and were desperately seeking a win i have to give credit to my assistant coaches this week as they took game planning and practice planning responsibilities i appreciate all the phone calls and the e mails now we have to go back to business
4908719 you cant have two turnovers in the fourth quarter and expect to win
4908720 two weeks ago when we played bloomington we scored 49 points but our defense didnt make any stops last week our pass rush was good with andy poulosky letarius lee and brandon johnson our defense played well last week and gave us an opportunity to win
4908721 this is a high scoring game omaha and sioux falls score a lot of points if your defense can get you three stops you should be able to win the game
4908722 the amount of running ive done coming in wasnt enough cardiovascularly i felt comfortable but my legs had gone my calf went first then it went up the entire leg and it felt like i was running on one leg but i didnt do all that work for nothing its just really frustrating
4908723 i was going to the finish line no matter what i did all the hard work and it feels frustrating because cardiovascularly i dont feel like ive run i tried to to the right things in the race tried to go after constantina but my legs werent there
4908724 i didnt feel sick or in distress but there was nothing else i could do its not the end i knew i was pushing it coming in with three and a half weeks of running you cant take shortcuts in the marathon and i guess i learned that today i dont think this is redemption for athens but it would have been for nothing if i hadnt finished
4908725 fingers crossed for 2012 look at constantina maybe i can do that in 2012 if my body holds up i know in london ill have all that support

4908739 i have a history of doing these songs where i incorporate the names of labels famous people or animals like i did on animal planet
4908740 this time im speaking about cars but im speaking about them in a whole different fashion i start the song off by saying i took her off the floor no money down im talking about a female but im comparing her to a car im not talking about how much my rims cost my soft leather seats the tvs in the headrest and all these things that really have no value or meaning to me
4908741 i never focus on what people are listening to or what other guys are doing
4908742 since day one its always been about lyrics so i never go into the studio with the idea of making a club song or a radio song or something that females will like it just has to come naturally

4908748 the man lies facedown in a deserted soapstone quarry strangled to death by a piano wire his face frozen and purple is still recognizably slavic and all the labels have been cut from his clothing
4908749 it was 1 40 a m or something and hes telling me he is walking home from the bar and if i get the message i should call him or pick him up
4908750 he said he was near the place where he wrecked his car a few weeks before
4908751 it wasnt unusual for me to have to call him several times in the mornings
4908752 i told them who i was and where i was going detective tim sandrock said mr jennings is no longer with us and i didnt understand what he meant i thought where did he go but then sandrock said no robert passed away this morning how why i couldnt believe it
4908753 we were inseparable he was like a brother to me my kids called him uncle robert he was one of the family our home was his home
4908754 he was funny witty he was the type of guy that could get one liners out so fast you could miss them
4908755 he was also a man of principle and passionate about his work
4908756 the only thing we could come up with was that mr bewley was with tina weaver at the time
4908757 he just wasnt that familiar with the road he probably thought his house was a couple miles but it really was more like five or six
4908758 he told us that in his opinion there was no doubt in his mind that robert was beaten was murdered he had defense wounds on his forearms that clearly were not injuries from an accident
4908759 there were no visible injuries on his body if he had a head injury like one they said might have caused his death he would not have been able to function
4908760 after the accident we saw him every day we traveled for work to georgia two weeks later and worked in 100 degree heat he didnt miss a day of work
4908761 anytime there is a death scene investigation we look at it as a homicide and work back by ruling it out
4908762 it the cause of death could be from an old injury combined with a new injury we will know more after the autopsy
4908763 as soon as they heard he had twisted his ankle it seemed that is what they latched onto the fall
4908764 i think somebody killed him and the investigators tried to sweep it under the rug
4908765 you dont get bruised on both sides of your head from a fall it seems a cover up to me
4908766 when he sandrock started telling us robert fell i thought this guys not only not on the right track hes in a different area code
4908767 the three doctors all experienced and respected agreed that robert died from blunt force trauma to the head that occurred that night that night
4908768 they all agreed there was no evidence of pre existing conditions that contributed to his death
4908769 the county doesnt really have the resources to properly investigate murder cases
4908770 and in states like california for example they have medical examiners not elected coroners that arent as trained
4908771 i know finding answers wont bring him back but i hate going to bed every night thinking someone got away with something
4908772 it kills me to think he fought for his country and his demise was from a coward
4908773 because i live here robert lived here i brought him here and now hes dead and nobodys done anything about it
4908774 the case is still open and we are actively investigating
4908775 the leads are minimal but there are still unanswered questions about the timeline of what happened after he left the bar to when he was found
4908776 what on earth is he trying to accomplish with that racket
4908777 ill get the okra while you do the tomatoes dad
4908778 passion begins with a burden and a split second moment when you understand something like never before that burden is on those who know those who dont know are at peace those of us who do know get disturbed and are forced to take action
4908779 ill be a little nervous or have some anxiety tomorrow said the 52 year old funk who led after two rounds at the u
4908780 but i think if you dont have that there is something wrong with you

4908785 lets win another nine and no one will remember this one
4908786 i hadnt been on the hill to start in a while i felt i had command of my pitches
4908787 he threw me a little cutter that ran in i just told myself get jammed and try to hit it to the right side and luckily for us i did
4908788 ive been pursuing it but havent gotten a response from him bill davis
4908789 i have a partner who has lined up the money to do this and weve been kicking around on some stuff he is davis off on the numbers and had some bigger people chasing it the last time i talked to him davis i had the money but didnt get the documents that we requested
4908790 i just heard some of those quotes and i was pretty amazed by them weve continued to talk to danny weve talked to several people yes all weve ever talked about with anybody is the entire operation
4908791 we wouldnt be talking about that in public its not to that stage yet that would be a question for danny what his plan is
4908792 like ive said all along the days of the small teams are very very numbered
4908793 anything we can do to improve ourselves wed be interested in talking about we are open to anything
4908794 id prefer to stay im not ready to quit by any means
4908795 its pretty hard to do this every week the little teams the little guys those teams are very very numbered our sport has taken a different direction
4908796 i am always interested in the right deal but with cat gone they dont have a sponsor
4908797 there is a meeting going on right now regarding bill davis racing so it does have some potential
4908798 i know there is a group floating around that has danny sullivan involved in it that wants to buy a team i dont know for sure if it is this team or another team or who they are looking at and talking to
4908799 i know one of the guys involved in that group i have seen danny sullivan and know another one of those guys in that group
4908800 the problem in this sport is bill davis has to bring in more money to get this team to compete no doubt
4908801 to compete its all about being able to afford the right people and keep the right people
4908802 it is uncertain for me somewhat but ive gotten used to that here
4908803 like anybody you want a competitive race car to drive with a good sponsor and good people weve had that here a lot of times but were not consistent enough we can run in the top 10 one week and 30th the next week weve struggled a little bit with that but all the right ingredients are here it takes money to keep the right people and keep enough people thats part of the sport right now
4908804 pedro kept them off balance and got big outs when he needed to
4908805 he pitched extremely well for us it was very impressive we need that type of effort going forward
4908806 its starting to come along the last two outings ive been making adjustments to get where i needed to be i had command of the fastball especially getting ahead and the changeup they kept swinging at it and that made it easier for me
4908807 i feel really good about this win weve just got to close the game out
4908808 weve got to get through the end of the game
4908809 i left a fastball up to reyes and he made me pay for it
4908810 he took two to three innings to get into a rhythm he cant do that when that happens the damage is already done
4908811 it was nice to see us push it in the ninth

4908818 would you rather be a tarheel or a dead dog
4908819 to provide recycling services and education to individuals schools municipalities commercial entities and industrial entities and to promote and encourage a better environment for future generations
4908820 we started out putting newspaper through hay balers but we were constantly running out of paper
4908821 i saw them taking the glass bottles plastic and cardboard and i figured hey theres got to be some money in selling that stuff too if theyre taking it
4908822 we handle about 500 to 600 tons of recyclables a month
4908823 were adding a 13th curbside program and hopefully looking at revamping some of our sorting equipment
4908824 we were kind of revolutionary we sorted everything by single stream collection meaning we took everything and put it through one big sorting line picking out the individual pieces as we went i think we were the only ones doing it when we started but now its the main method for most recycling facilities
4908825 a lot of businesses werent set up for it fortunately we were
4908826 we started this as a small side business never imagining that itd become our main job
4908827 over time we became more cost efficient and cost effective and we thought you know we could really do this
4908828 we start off by taking out the cardboard and brown paper on the top line then the newspaper books magazines and then the higher grade paper you know the office paper and junk mail thats worth a little more
4908829 the bottom line handles the plastic and the glass which is sorted by both color and type then the fun part comes in
4908830 you wouldnt believe the kinds of stuff people throw in with the recycling all of which we end up having to take out by hand
4908831 weve found diapers vacuum cleaner parts weve even found a dead cat once and a live raccoon
4908832 were right on the edge of being able to make some more really big changes once we hit the threshold of doing about 800 to 1000 tons of recycling a month we can buy automated sorting equipment to aid in the process we wouldnt switch over to them wed add them in we still definitely need human bodies working on the floor and the machines would only aid in how efficiently we sort
4908833 you know one of the biggest problems we have is people not cleaning the food waste out of what they recycle making our job a lot harder in the end recycling is often about convenience the national recycling coalition discovered that 140 million people wont recycle unless its convenient its that 140 million people that were trying to reach making it easier for them
4908834 people dont pay attention to the signs by the drop off sites
4908835 so we end up having to pay attention for them single stream recycling is about making it easy for the public by putting all of their recyclables together for us to pick up but it seems that sometimes even thats not easy enough its frustrating to see aluminum cans in the trash or people burning cardboard recycling saves natural resources natural energy and creates jobs why wouldnt everyone pay attention and get behind that
4908836 in the early 90s people cared because it was directly affecting the landfills and then interest dropped off towards the new millennium recently interest has really picked up again with all the talk of global warming and living greener people seem to be more conscious of the environment around us and thats a good thing

4908848 i guess its safe to say ive played my last game in a bulls uniform
4908849 have no different quality for me than all other people
4908850 the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses the bible a collection of honourable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish
4908851 no interpretation no matter how subtle can for me change this
4908852 for me the jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions
4908853 and the jewish people to whom i gladly belong and with whose mentality i have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people
4908854 as far as my experience goes they are no better than other human groups although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power otherwise i cannot see anything chosen about them
4908855 its just deep enough to where the waves dissipate and the turbulence dissipates down to the bottom

4908858 has become the teams unofficial anthem and more a rousing eighth inning singalong turned musical totem whose propitious properties remain a mystery even to the songwriter who the folks at fenway have been trying to lure to the park for years
4908859 im not sure i understand it but its fun to sing along with and for me its always been a good luck song
4908860 its been around for so long and i think that anybody who adopts it has some of that good luck the fact that the red sox have adopted it proves the point
4908861 i put home runs and good pitching in front of the song
4908862 but the song does capture the spirit of the team
4908863 they liked it and they just loved the crowd reaction with it and stuff
4908864 why did this happen what caused this to happen and why did it happen to me
4908865 no escuches ning n mal no hables ning n mal y no veas ning n mal
4908866 the set is outside but air conditioning vents make the weather bearable
4908867 the first couple of nights even with the air conditioning it was steamy in here but weve been lucky ever since
4908868 its been overcast some days takes the temperature down we call it fog smog
4908869 its also a stalled undertaking and its a secret undertaking this hasnt been a process so far that we can have a lot of confidence in
4908870 nothing like this has ever been done and we have to really be careful because were dealing with peoples lives were dealing with peoples privacy
4908871 even though curtis is not here to witness that i think for his familys sake to know because they always believed in him

4908877 we dont have a lot of serious injuries at tight end just bumps and bruises
4908878 but the good thing about it is those fullbacks can kind of float back and forth at fullback and tight end
4908879 especially with a guy like mike rinfrette who weighs 265 pounds he could probably compete for the starting job as a fullback and a starting job as a tight end hes got the flexibility to do both
4908880 its pretty tough switching over and back over and back
4908881 it feels pretty good to know where youre going to be and youre getting in there and doing what youre supposed to do
4908882 i think he understands we would never move him if he didnt think it was good for him and good for the team
4908883 we wouldnt expect him to move for instance from starting fullback to a backup linebacker
4908884 so i think he knows if we made a move like that it would be worthwhile
4908885 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments seeing these things it changes you
4908886 i said im going to win the olympic gold medal
4908887 i have 100 percent confidence in myself that i can win the gold and 100 percent belief in my coaches

4908891 kick hard off the wall coast in the middle let your legs float so theres less drag in the water
4908892 he was coached well in high school im not sure he played as well today as he has in practice
4908893 in fact until you mentioned it i didnt think about it its good to have them both back
4908894 even when we were in spartanburg he was still there and i was telling him to watch my technique and let me know when my footwork is bad and when im doing something wrong
4908895 hes been helping out the corners letting us know if youre playing a little too far off or youre playing this way thats why i did this route
4908896 watching film the end man on the line always blocked down on me he never let me come free
4908897 so once he let me come free it put up some flags something wasnt right i didnt know he was going to pitch it i actually thought it was going to be a run fake
4908898 i know this sounds clich but weve got to come together as a team in order for us to reach our full potential
4908899 we played people tough but it wasnt enough to get better we have to find ways to close out the opposition
4908900 our players know what to expect they know what they can do and theyre definitely hungry to prove themselves
4908901 they didnt like losing that first round playoff game at home theyre eager to get another chance
4908902 the maturity of our players will make a big difference
4908903 and weve had a lot of growth on defense our goals are to win the conference and go deep in the playoffs we have 25 seniors this year so anything short of reaching our goals would be considered a letdown
4908904 what i like most about this group is that theyre hungry to be successful
4908905 our skill people for this season are the best weve ever had were very young but we have a lot of kids who have some game experience this is not a rebuilding year theres enough quality to help us compete in a tough league
4908906 a big key for us is to have some success early
4908907 weve got to maintain offensive possessions and not turn the ball over and its especially critical that we stay healthy on both lines because we dont have a lot of depth in those areas
4908908 our theme make other teams beat us let us not beat ourselves
4908909 all but one of our losses came in games where we lost the turnover battle
4908910 we proved that we can beat some good teams mount tabor ragsdale but we also lost some games that we shouldnt have lost hopefully well be better because of what we experienced
4908911 we have to keep offensive possessions going so we dont put our defense in a bind as long as we play to our capabilities we expect to be right in the mix
4908912 for me personally and for the team as well just because things seemed to be coming all together but its something youve got to move on and take it as ive had a minor setback and ill have a major comeback thats the whole idea everything happens for a reason and i just sort of let go and let god
4908913 losing donald is a tough loss for the football team
4908914 when you lose your most experienced and best receiver coming back it certainly hurts you especially when you are trying to find a quarterback we have faced this situation in the past and one mans misfortune is another mans opportunity we are just waiting for another man to step in there and take advantage of that opportunity
4908915 the veteran guys have to step up with more leadership but theyre all pretty good
4908916 when you look you only have a couple of guys who have been in a football game out there so they are about as green as the quarterback situation with the exception of daniel evans and those guys being in a game its a situation thats a work in progress and some of those kids have to step up and make some plays
4908917 whenever you do this you always hope someone will stand out and grab the situation and run away from the other people
4908918 that really hasnt happened right now its probably not the most ideal thing its always better if you have someone who takes control of the situation whether it be quarterback tight end defensive back whatever
4908919 but at this point in time our goal is to just concentrate on getting better every day hopefully well play our best football in november when its playoff time to get to that point our players have to challenge themselves to give all they have regardless of who we play
4908920 we have a lot of depth up front which will allow us to continuously put pressure on the offense were not going to sit back were coming after people
4908921 they really enjoyed the atmosphere of playing in a championship game and they are eager to get another shot at it for the time being though the state championship is a long way off its in our best interest to focus on whats at hand and thats to get ready for the start of the season
4908922 its a tough challenge every year but our kids want to keep pushing the bar a little higher
4908923 if we can play consistent feed off our defense and control game tempo with our offense well help ourselves a lot
4908924 we have several key players who go both ways all we want to do is keep the game close so we can give ourselves a genuine opportunity to win at the end were a finesse team so were going to use our speed and quickness to our advantage
4908925 were good to go im ready to get started and see what happens
4908926 so now well benefit from all the game experience they gained the defense is much further along because the players are a lot more mature
4908927 he kicks so deep on kickoffs that most teams arent likely to get any returns plus his ability to pin opponents deep in their territory with his punts will work wonders for field position
4908928 well be better this season i guarantee it as long as we keep improving every day and in every game well be all right
4908929 i live in a neighborhood that has a history of anxiety and stress
4908930 my parents were very protective and i always felt their anxiety may be i just inherited it
4908931 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4908932 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4908933 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4908934 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
4908935 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
4908936 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom

4909018 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4909019 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4909020 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4909021 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4909022 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4909023 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4909024 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4909025 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change

4909077 a123 materials are designed to ensure all the lithium is fully extracted from the cathode when the battery is fully charged as a result safety issues relating to overcharge are eliminated because there is no lithium available to plate on the anode in an overcharged state this is in contrast to conventional li ion cells which only extract half their lithium content when they reach their upper cut off voltage conventional li ion cells are easy to overcharge and once in this state they can continue to extract lithium putting the cell in a dangerous mode and making it prone to fires and explosions
4909078 a123systems outstanding chemical stability and a flat plateau at a lower oxidation potential than other li ion chemistries provides our products with record life
4909079 our batteries are uniquely engineered pat pending so their internal resistance impedance will decrease with their use this is the opposite effect to most li ion cells which experience a growth in their internal resistance as they are cycled at high rates or temperatures this is a significant benefit in applications requiring long calendar life such as hybrid electric vehicles
4909080 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade

4909082 i have been working for months to secure their exit from the madrassa and from pakistan
4909083 this is great news but we need to get the other american children out of there now
4909084 there are nearly 80 other americans currently at this jamia binoria madrassa that teaches deobandism the religion of the taliban our government and the pakistani government has more work to do to get the other american children out of there
4909085 i do need to take responsibility for these things in terms of these were errors that sort of spun out of control
4909086 i have to take responsibility for the mistakes i take responsibility for the error in the allegation that osama bin laden was there i take responsibility for the error that some of the taliban leaders were there
4909087 i feel very happy that after four years im going back
4909088 i am glad i was sent to pakistan because it taught me to be a better person it taught me to appreciate what i had before and i knew when i came back i wasnt going to make the same mistake of not appreciating what i have

4909102 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4909103 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4909104 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4909105 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4909106 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4909107 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4909108 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4909109 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change

4909124 i dont know what the anxiety was maybe it was just the fact this was the mid step between the preliminaries and the final and all kinds of anxiety crept up in there but i was really pleased to see her push through
4909125 if blythe dives well she will be right on the cusp i think shell be right there

4909131 my nose completely clogs up my throat will sometimes depending on the type of allergy close up as well red puffy eyes just very itchy
4909132 we found that stress and anxiety make a big difference in terms of allergic responses
4909133 if you dont have an allergy youre just going to see a little bit of redness temporarily and thatll be the end of it but if youre a highly allergic person youre going to get something called a wheal
4909134 so the take home message is if youre allergic stress and anxiety are a bad combination
4909135 it seems like everyday im in sort of a dream world
4909136 sometimes you still have to pinch yourself to see if its really real im just happy im in the real world

4909161 haste made him careless and this fault always clung to him
4909162 erasmus first edition is in that respect the most faulty book i know
4909163 for is the kingdom of god to become words or syllables why should we be in bondage to them if we may be free use one precisely when we may use another no less fit as commodiously
4909164 he prophesieth shebnas deprivation and eliakim prefiguring the kingdom of christ his substitution
4909165 gods infallible and preserved word to the english speaking people
4909166 the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost
4909167 for the king james version came not in 1611 by the will of man but holy men of god translated as they were moved by the holy ghost
4909168 o ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own bowels now for a recompense in the same i speak as unto my children be ye also enlarged

4909170 the nature of language does not permit a perfect translation the semantic area of words differs between languages so that there is seldom complete overlap
4909171 no one so far as i know holds that the english translation of the bible is absolutely infallible and inerrant the doctrine held by many is that the scriptures as originally given were absolutely infallible and inerrant and that our english translation is a substantially accurate rendering of the scriptures as originally given

4909179 aimed at a radical purification and reconstruction of church and state emphasis is ours on the sole basis of the word of god
4909180 for settling of the government and liturgy of the church of england
4909181 the whole counsel of godis expressly set down in scripture or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from scripture
4909182 by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages
4909183 the first covenant made with man was a covenant of works wherein life was promised to adam and in him to his posterity upon condition of perfect obedience and faith
4909184 god gave to adam a law as a covenant of works by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal entire exact and perpetual obedience promised life upon the fulfilling and threatened death upon the breach of it and endued him with power and ability to keep it
4909185 chosen in christ unto salvation a certain number of men from the whole human race which had fallen by their own fault from their original integrity into sin and destruction neither better nor more worthy than others but with them involved in common misery
4909186 out of the common mass of sinners to adopt some certain persons as a peculiar people to himself
4909187 wherefore they who are elected being fallen in adam are redeemed by christ
4909188 wherefore they who are elected being fallen in adam are redeemed by christ
4909189 that some receive the gift of faith from god and others do not receive it proceeds form gods eternal decree
4909190 the rest of mankind god was pleased according to the unsearchable counsel of his own will whereby he extendeth or withholdeth mercy as he pleaseth for the glory of his sovereign power over his creatures to pass by and to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin to the praise of his glorious justice
4909191 the almighty power unsearchable wisdom and infinite goodness of god so far manifest themselves in his providence that it extendeth itself even to the first fall and all other sins of angles and men and that not by a bare permission but such as hath joined with it a most wise and powerful bounding latin limitatio and otherwise ordering and governing of them in a manifold dispensation to his own holy ends
4909192 to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin
4909193 the lord jesus by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself which he through the eternal spirit once offered up unto god hath fully satisfied the justice of his father and purchased not only reconciliation but an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven for all those whom the father hath given unto him
4909194 although the work of redemption was not actually wrought by christ till after his incarnation yet the virtue efficacy and benefits thereof were communicated unto
4909195 as god hath appointed the elect unto glory so hath he by the eternal and most free purpose of his will foreordained all the means thereunto wherefore they who are elected being fallen in adam are redeemed by christ are effectually called unto faith in christ by his spirit working in due season are justified adopted sanctified and kept by his power through faith unto salvation neither are any other redeemed by christ effectually called justified adopted sanctified and saved but the elect only
4909196 chap iii sec 6 and chap viii sec 8 which speak against universal redemption i understand not of all redemption and particularly not of the mere bearing the punishment of mans sins and satisfying gods justice but of that special redemption proper to the elect which was accompanied with an intention of actual application of the saving benefits in time if i may not be allowed this interpretation i must herein dissent
4909197 man by his fall having made himself incapable of life by that covenant the lord was pleased to make a second commonly called the covenant of grace wherein he freely offered latin offert unto sinners life and salvation by jesus christ requiring of them faith in him that they may be saved and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto life his holy spirit to make them willing and able to believe
4909198 the effectual call is of gods free and special grace alone not from any thing at all foreseen in man who is altogether passive therein until being quickened and renewed by the holy spirit he is thereby enabled to answer this call and to embrace the grace offered latin exhibitam and conveyed in it
4909199 what is faith in jesus christ faith in jesus christ is a saving grace whereby we receive and rest upon him alone for salvation as he is offered latin offertur to us in the gospel
4909200 requiring of them faith in him that they might be saved
4909201 wherein he freely offered unto sinners life and salvation by jesus christ
4909202 others not elected although they may be called by the ministry of the word and may have some common operations of the spirit yet they never truly come unto christ and therefore can not be saved
4909203 thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength question 6 did god then create man so wicked and perverse b true righteousness and holiness that he might rightly know god his creator heartily love him and live with him in eternal happiness to glorify and praise him question 7 whence then proceeds this depravity of human nature answer from the fall and disobedience of our first parents adam and eve question 9 doth not god then do injustice to man by requiring from him in his low that which he cannot perform d deprived himself and all his posterity of those divine gifts question 10 will god suffer such disobedience and rebellion to go unpunished rom 6 23 the second part of mans deliverance question 12 since then by the righteous judgment of god we deserved temporal and eternal punishment is there no way by which we may escape that punishment and be again received into favor question 14 can there be found anywhere one who is a mere creature able to satisfy for us e punish any other creature for the sin which man hath committed and further no mere creature can sustain the burden of gods eternal wrath against sin so as to question 15 what sort of a mediator and deliverer then must we seek for question 16 why must he be very man and also perfectly righteous answer because the justice of god requires that the same human nature which hath sinned should answer that he might by the power of his godhead question 18 who then is that mediator who is in one person both very god and a real righteous man f us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption
4909204 i believe in god the father almighty maker of heaven and earth
4909205 christ shall come again to judge the quick and the dead
4909206 the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this i this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the lords death till he come
4909207 and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
4909208 there is a continuing and genuine disagreement if not contention as to whether or not text types existed in the earliest centuries
4909209 family 1739 to refer both to the smaller manuscript family which contains 1739 323 945 etc
4909210 the so called western text type is the uncontrolled popular text of the second century
4909211 any reading not found in the and supported by two or more c sarean witnesses
4909212 a text type is the largest group of sources which can be generally identified
4909213 this definition is a definition of a text type as a group of manuscripts italics mine not a list of readings
4909214 this suggest that the quantitative definition of a text type is a group of manuscripts that agree more than 70 per cent of the time and is separated by a gap of about ten percent from its neighbors
4909215 a text type may be defined as an established textual cluster or constellation of mss with a distinctive textual character or complexion that differentiates it from other textual constellations
4909216 such differentiations must not be based on general impressions or random samples but on full quantitative comparison
4909217 a text type seems to be found in a shared pattern of readings held in common in a significant degree by member mss to the exclusion of the presence of competing patterns in a proportionally significant quantity
4909218 the major text types trace their beginnings to the diocletianic persecution and the age of constantine which followed
4909219 god would not let the church lose the true text of the bible
4909220 k i and k ik are not distinguishable from k 1 and k 1 could not maintain itself as an independent group and is treated as a k x cluster
4909221 the silence of the fathers is explainable and therefore is not a proof of lateness
4909222 the conflate or longer readings are not a proof of lateness
4909223 the composite nature of the byzantine text attests the early existence of its readings where its strands unite
4909224 the byzantine text is unedited in the westcott hort sense
4909225 we may describe this group p 46 b 1739 sah boh clem orig as proto alexandrian
4909226 the text of galatians evidence from the earliest greek manuscripts
4909227 method in establishing the nature of text types of new testament manuscripts
4909228 the proper method of genealogy consists in the more or less complete recovery of successive ancestors by analysis of their respective descendants each ancestral text so recovered being in its turn used for the recovery of a yet earlier common ancestor
4909229 hort used genealogical method very little and that the basic element in his method was judgement of readings is now widely recognized
4909230 method in establishing quantitative relationships between text types of new testament manuscripts
4909231 weak members of a text type may contain no more of the total content of a text type than strong members of some other text type may contain the comparison in total agreements of one manuscript with another manuscript has little significance beyond that of confirmation and then only if the agreement is large enough to be distinctive
4909232 if survivors are few the stemma perforce brings into proximity manuscripts that historically were widely separated in time and place
4909233 before you can apply statistics you must have exact and complete figures which in this field do not exist in fact they never will nor can exist none but commensurable entities can be reduces to figures and no two variants are strictly commensurable readings of all shades between good and bad slips of the pen and intentional alterations attestation by anything between one and a thousand witnesses what is their common denominator
4909234 mixed manuscripts could never meet the colwell tune standard of 70 agreements expressed in percentages will tend to wash out the characteristics of the group to which the mixed ms belongs nothing can offset this drawback of statistical analysis
4909235 the patmos project an investigation of the patmos family of new testament mss and its allies in the pericope of the adulteress and beyond
4909236 in conclusion i suggest that the location of a manuscript within the tradition should use multiple readings to find the related group distinctive readings to demonstrate the kinship and total comparison to confirm the relationship
4909237 these editors use manuscripts as drunkards use lampposts not to light them on their way but to dissimulate their instability
4909238 it seems to me unlikely that the byzantine editors ever altered the text without manuscript evidence they left so many hopelessly difficult places unassailed their method i submit was selection rather than conjecture
4909239 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4909240 the bornean clouded leopard is a top priority for our programme
4909241 we are very excited by this evidence that they occur at sebangau a great deal remains to be discovered about these beautiful felids which are a flagship for conservation in south east asia
4909242 there are slight errors in the oxford edition which do not conform either to the hebrew and greek or to the original authorized version of 1611
4909243 i have found at least 3 errors in the oxford edition of the kjb
4909244 the oxford edition is the more commonly used one in the united states
4909245 in jeremiah 34 16 the oxford university press king james version is wrong false and in error
4909246 the error was limited to the editions published by oxford or those based on the oxford edition
4909247 mistakenly printed whom he instead of the correct whom ye
4909248 cambridge university press did not make the printing error and all cambridge type texts have the correct readings
4909249 the text conforms to that of the oxford bible printed at the university press oxford
4909250 that the cambridge edition of the king james bible is more accurate than the oxford edition
4909251 if anything be halting or superfluous or not so agreeable to the original the same may be corrected and the truth set in place
4909252 was their translation good before why do they now mend it
4909253 how is it then that in your later english bibles you changed your former translation from better to worse
4909254 books which were so translated by tyndale and the like as being not indeed gods book word or scripture but the devils word
4909255 the king james bible is a revision of that line of received text english bibles stretching back to tyndale
4909256 among the revisers of the bible assembled by james i p 40
4909257 leading up to the kjv there were six good and correct bibles written
4909258 they were based upon the same greek text and employed the same type of translation methodology
4909259 the geneva bible was based on the traditional text textus receptus as was the great bible the bishops bible and the coverdale bible
4909260 we will not condemn them tyndale wycliffe or geneva they have substantially the same greek and hebrew text as the king james bible
4909261 which greek text most closely corresponds to the original new testament
4909262 which one is superior i e which comes closer to presenting the greek text in its original form
4909263 who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit
4909264 i simply do not know for certain what this bible verse or passage means
4909265 till heauen and earth passe one iote or one title shall in no wise passe from the law till all be fulfilled
4909266 i have also read a great part of origen who opens out new fountains of thought and furnishes a complete key to theology
4909267 to cambridge to learn greek under erasmus who was teaching there from 1510 to 1514
4909268 it has sometimes been suggested that one of erasmus pupils at cambridge was william tyndale unfortunately the evidence is against this erasmus left cambridge in 1514 and tyndale probably did not arrive there before 1516 at the earliest
4909269 it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and he trembling and astonished said lord what wilt thou have me to do and the lord said to him
4909270 there were hundreds of manuscripts for erasmus to examine and he did emphasis added but he only used a few
4909271 the few erasmus used were typical that is after he had thoroughly balanced the evidence of many
4909272 haste made him careless and this fault always clung to him
4909273 erasmus first edition is in that respect the most faulty book i know
4909274 in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one and there are three that bear witness in earth
4909275 it should be stated at once that the textus receptus is not a bad text it is not a heretical text it is substantially correct
4909276 the textus receptus is not a bad or misleading text either theologically or practically technically however it is far from the original text yet three centuries were to pass before scholars had won the struggle to replace this hastily assembled text by a text which gave evidence of being closer to the n t autographs
4909277 the real text of the sacred writings is competently exact nor is one article of faith or moral precept either perverted or lost choose as awkwardly as you will choose the worst by design out of the whole lump of readings but even put them into the hands of a knave or a fool and yet with the most sinistrous and absurd choice he shall not extinguish the light of any one chapter nor so disguise christianity but that every feature of it will still be the same
4909278 the almost complete freedom of holy scripture from the bare suspicion of wilful corruption the absolute identity of the testimony of every known copy in respect to doctrine and spirit and the main drift of every argument and every narrative through the entire volume of inspiration thus hath gods providence kept from harm the treasure of his written word so far as is needful for the quiet assurance of his church and people
4909279 for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen
4909280 the only way to determine the true text is to examine the early codices
4909281 there were greek councils which did not know latin at all
4909282 aristotle was even a pagan will you not read him if you claim that the vulgate is inspired equally with the original greek and hebrew and that to touch it is heresy and blasphemy what will you say about bede rhabanus thomas aquinas and nicolas of lyra not to mention others who undertook to make improvements you must distinguish between scripture the translation of scripture and the transmission of both what will you do with the errors of copyists
4909283 if in one point the vulgate were in error the entire authority of holy scripture would collapse love and faith would be extinguished heresies and schisms would abound blasphemy would be committed against the holy spirit the authority of theologians would be shaken and indeed the catholic church would collapse from the foundations
4909284 you cry out that it is a crime to correct the gospels this is a speech worthier of a coachman than of a theologian you think it is all very well if a clumsy scribe makes a mistake in transcription and then you deem it a crime to put it right the only way to determine the true text is to examine the early codices
4909285 the priests saw the danger and attacked the translation and the translator
4909286 if you cannot answer a mans arguments all is not lost you can still call him vile names
4909287 i am very far from pretending to understand completely the oft renewed vitality of mariolatry
4909288 if the premises are sufficient they are so no matter by whom stated
4909289 you can prove im the devils brother and you still havent answered my argument
4909290 the greatest defender of the inerrancy of the bible among scholarly theologians of the recent past
4909291 christ i know luther i know not the roman church i know and death will not part me from it till the church departs from christ
4909292 i have sought to save the dignity of the roman pontiff the honour of catholic theology and the welfare of christendom
4909293 abolish the mass put it away make an end of it
4909294 such problems may be discussed among the learned for the vulgar it is enough to believe that the real body and blood of our lord are actually present
4909295 he was as much a forerunner of rationalism as of the reformation
4909296 her consent is so important to me that i would agree with the arians and pelagians if the church should approve of what they taught
4909297 i have also read a great part of origen who opens out new fountains of thought and furnishes a complete key to theology
4909298 kjv onlyism is not really a doctrine it is just something we believe
4909299 the bible doesnt explicitly use the word rapture or trinity either yet they are still biblical doctrines
4909300 not all truth is contained in the bible the bible doesnt tell us there are 66 books in the bible or that accelleration due to gravity on earth is approximately 9 8 m s 2
4909301 he has preserved it for the english speaking world in the authorized king james bible
4909302 we believe that the holy bible consisting of sixty six books of the old and new testament scriptures was written by men divinely inspired and it is a perfect treasure of heavenly instruction that is has god for its author salvation for its end and truth without any mixture of error for its matter that it reveals the principles by which god will judge us and therefore is and shall remain to the end of the world the true center of christian union and the supreme standard by which all human conduct creeds and opinions should be tried we believe that the preserved word of god for the english speaking people is the king james version of the bible bible reference ii tim 3 16 17 ii peter 1 21 ii sam 23 2 acts 1 16 acts 3 21 john 10 35 luke 16 29 31 prov 30 5 6 john 17 17 rev 22 18 19 rom 3 4 rom 2 12 john 12 47 48
4909303 we believe the bible is the inspired word of god we believe the bible to be without fault and fully trustworthy
4909304 we believe the authorized king james bible of 1611 in any edition is the providentially preserved given by inspiration inerrant written words of god which contains both the old and new testaments and it is the final absolute authority in all matters psalm 12 6 7 119 40 proverbs 30 5 matthew 24 35 luke 24 27 1 timothy 5 18 2 timothy 3 15 17
4909305 the angel moroni was the guardian of the golden plates containing new scripture
4909306 xenu brought people to earth 75 million years ago in a spaceship and then blew them up in volcanos
4909307 the bible doesnt explicitly use the word rapture or trinity
4909308 god because i asked him and he told me this is true
4909309 did you know that in the king james version of the bible the word advertise means tell allege means prove and conversation means behavior that communicate means share take through means be anxious and prevent means precede that meat is a general term for food and anon and by and by translate greek words which mean immediately these words and many like them made perfect sense to readers when the kjv was published in 1611 but today after nearly four centuries of changes in english few readers know what such words mean and most readers miss the riches of the all time favorite king james bible
4909310 for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are tempted
4909311 because he himself suffered when he was tempted he is able to help those who are being tempted
4909312 for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to aid those who are tempted
4909313 if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him
4909314 if anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching do not take him into your house or welcome him
4909315 if anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine do not receive him into your house nor greet him
4909316 the plain truth of the matter is that the version that is so cherished among senior saints who have more or less come to terms with elizabethan english is obscure confusing and sometimes even incomprehensible to many younger or poorly educated christians
4909317 to the only god our savior be glory majesty power and authority through jesus christ our lord before all ages now and forevermore amen
4909318 to the only wise god our saviour be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and for ever amen
4909319 you may ask me for anything in my name and i will do it
4909320 if ye shall ask any thing in my name i will do it
4909321 should we pray to jesus christ as well as praying through him to the father
4909322 the same followed paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high god which show unto us
4909323 for god did so love the world that his son the only begotten he gave that every one who is believing in him may not perish but may have life age during
4909324 betooke themselues vnto praier and besought him that the sinne committed might wholy bee put out of remembrance besides that noble iudas exhorted the people to keep themselues from sinne forsomuch as they saw before their eyes the things that came to passe for the sinne of those y were slaine and also in that he perceiued that there was great fauour layed vp for those that died godly it was an holy and good thought wherupon he made a reconciliation for the dead that they might be deliuered from sinne
4909325 but the feareful and vnbeleeuing and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all lyars shall haue their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
4909326 the greek does not have the aorist tense suggesting completed action see the blass debrunner grammar but the present infinitive of continuing action so a better translation is already filling up nasb or nearly swamped niv if the boat had been now full kjv it would have been at the bottom of the lake
4909327 the kjv reads the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god the rsv changes itself to himself orthodox christianity has always held to the deity of jesus christ and the personality of the holy spirit modern liberalism has frequently denied both the kjv rendering here would seem to deny the personality of the holy spirit calling him an it even if one is reading the kjv in the pulpit he should always change itself to himself by doing so we affirm our faith in the holy spirit not as an impersonal influence but as a living person who dwells in our hearts the question may well be raised why does the kjv use it in referring to the spirit the simple answer is that the greek word for spirit pneuma is neuter hence it is necessary for grammatical reasons that the pronoun referring back to a neuter noun as its antecedent should also be neuter in form but not in meaning this is just one of many examples of an accidental disharmony in the grammatical usages of two different languages as every student of foreign languages knows the precise distinction between masculine feminine and neuter to which we are accustomed in english is little known outside our language we have to translate the thought not just the mechanical form of the word paul believed in the personality of the holy spirit this very verse is the declaration of a personal function the spirit witnesses
4909328 anyone who uses a recent scholarly version of the nt will see that these words on the trinity are not in verse 7 this is because they have no basis in the greek text under roman catholic pressure erasmus inserted them from the latin vulgate they are not a part of the inspired bible
4909329 why does it not point out that erasmus unlike luther and calvin never left the roman catholic church
4909330 i will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them though they are a rebellious house
4909331 righteousness that cometh of our god and saviour jesus christ
4909332 christ came which is god over all blessed for ever
4909333 christ came which is god in all things to be praised forever
4909334 christ came who is god over all blessed for ever
4909335 he is subject ot the same affections and infirmities that others are
4909336 marueile not that i saide vnto thee ye must be borne againe
4909337 where the majority of greek manuscripts stand against the a v 1611 put them in file 13
4909338 when the greek says one thing and the a v says another throw out the greek
4909339 well you believe xyz because it says that in your version of the bible but you dont know a the subtle meaning of the original greek word or b that weve discovered new manuscripts and a different word was used there
4909340 demystifying the controversy over the textus receptus and the king james version of the bible
4909341 if it was good enough for the apostle paul it is good enough for me
4909342 several words and phrases may be found that are attested in no greek manuscript whatsoever
4909343 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one
4909344 where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched
4909345 it is well to remember that the main body of the text and its general sense are left untouched
4909346 bad or heretical text it presents the same christian message as the critical or westcott hort text
4909347 you ever hear of a cop going to law school anymore
4909348 of course not why bother they make too much yhey cant afford to take any time off even if they wanted to
4909349 saya sih nggak ngerti istilah pakei foto dan segala macamnya gitu yang tahu dian kalian juga tahu saya punya blog pasti dari dian ya
4909350 sudah begitu aku hobi foto foto di luar kota coba makanan yang belum pernah dimakan nah aku nyatet nyatet terus nanti ditulis di blog
4909351 tahun lalu aku makan berdua sama adilla dan dikasih kado sama dia tahun ini karena shaloom udah ngerti valentine ya ngerayain nya bertiga tapi masih belum tahu di mana
4909352 saya kira pemain melakukan banyak hal positif dan menciptakan banyak peluang pemain tampil bagus
4909353 mereka agak nervous di awal pertandingan karena ada tekanan bermain di wembley dan kami harus mengurangi hal tersebut
4909354 namun penting melihat para pemain kompak dan melihat mereka tampil bagus dan banyak hal yang positif
4909355 tentu saja masih banyak yang bisa ditingkatkan tetapi mereka mencetak gol dari satu satunya peluang yang mereka dapatkan jadi kami tidak banyak berbuat kesalahan
4909356 kalau dia punya pandangan yang akan disampaikan dia menyampaikannya dengan tegas jadi kami tahu posisi kami masing masing
4909357 i knew that when i was with everyone at the 1 000 that was good i knew that it would be hard for everyone to hold that pace i held on held steady in the third 500 and then just took it up a little i figured i had about 30 hard strokes it was really about 45 at the end i was just saying keep it together dont let up it was better than my best race
4909358 we shot 45 percent from the 3 and we shot close to 80 from the free throw line so thats a plus if we can do that
4909359 we know were going to defend we know were going to get fast break points but when we can shoot the ball from the outside like that and shoot free throws well its going to be tough to beat us
4909360 it was something for us personally to say where do we measure up with the champions
4909361 as far as i am concerned we have a deal
4909362 we went to buy a motor home for pound16 000 but ended up paying pound37 000 for one because it had a section at the back that was ideal for sugar
4909363 i love sugar to bits and didnt want to leave her behind
4909364 really good interesting photography at the olympics from one of the best
4909365 i was able to borrow an 800mm 5 6 lens from canon both canon and nikon set up shot at the main press center and loan equipment to photographers as well as make repairs on site which is priceless the 800mm is a lens thats just been released by canon and i really wanted to see what i could pull off with it one of the reasons that this lens is useful is that there are only 4 5 of them here at the olympics and what that means is that there are very few other photographers who will be shooting with it why does this matter because you can shoot from positions that others arent in because they are shooting with different shorter lenses and this gives you a little more breathing room and a better chance of making a unique frame the olympics are all about trying to make frames that no one else is making and thats something thats very difficult to pull off when youre competing with the best 1 500 sports photographers in the world
4909366 maybe it comes around once in a lifetime its almost disbelief to some degree
4909367 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4909368 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4909369 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4909370 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4909371 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4909372 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4909373 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4909374 i have to take something positive from the way i was playing this week
4909375 thats what i expected and hoped for many years ago when i got to no 1 that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically i think rafa totally deserves it
4909376 its not the first time this tournament or in my life i had to serve for a big match
4909377 its basically the moment you dream of being in even though there is so much pressure to it
4909378 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4909379 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4909380 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4909381 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
4909382 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4909383 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4909384 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4909385 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4909386 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4909387 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4909388 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4909397 meu pior pecado foi o ego smo durante minha juventude experimentei drogas bebi fiz tudo isso porque s pensava em mim mesmo pela minha incapacidade em me concentrar nos demais
4909398 sou uma pessoa muito imperfeita mas acho que aquilo foi minha maior falha moral

4909408 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4909409 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4909410 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4909411 while making the first part i and my writer sachindra sharma decided that if the film becomes a hit we will go for its sequel now we are already working on part three
4909412 we have made sacrifices in the last few years to keep the company afloat so were just asking for our fair shair
4909413 were not unhappy with them were just upset that theyre not moving forward as fast as we would like them to

4909418 the indo us nuclear deal is important for indias energy security and i think swiss government will most likely support the waiver for new delhi at the nsg meet
4909419 the nuclear deal is good for india and it should be allowed to go through
4909420 and the heavens opened and saved me from then on they have been my biggest influence
4909421 i have one clear message for them people will be out there enforcing the law and if the law needs any amendment then we wont hesitate to do so
4909422 like any law once its out there being implemented if we find any need to improve it then well do so
4909423 in a typical recession you lose one out of five customers because customers change their behavior
4909424 there are no more set formulas about how to set a price
4909425 in terms of your ability to justify the cost increase to the customer its easier to do if you can show that you dont have any choice but to pass it on
4909426 when hes on vacation he can go to the second floor
4909427 if the government simply bans certain practices it finds objectionable the industry will find new practices and we will be one step behind
4909428 it has to be a resort area which codman square is not
4909429 never mistake knowledge for wisdom one helps you make a living the other helps you make a life
4909430 ok ladies my husband looked around all around the store and actually bought some stuff there for himself we didnt even have to make a target trip really thats a good thing cause he needed some crafts for
4909431 we are more than conquerors through the one who loved us for i am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor anything above nor anything below nor anything else in all creation can separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord

4909440 when i took that last stroke i thought i lost the race there but it turns out that was the difference
4909441 the partnerships that are established during that short window of their athletic performance excellence can be sustained over decades if the relationships are maintained and if the business works for both sides so without being able to put a number on it over time its certainly possible that this will go from the tens of millions into the hundreds millions
4909442 the way that michaels partnerships are taken into the public the audiences for purchasing the services and products that michael is supporting are very different
4909443 so were very careful not only about the quantity but also of the delivery into the marketplace
4909444 hes the greatest olympian in the world and hell be able to earn money everywhere as hes an international brand
4909445 hes a billion dollar man he wont have to get a job ever he can live off this for 50 years
4909446 in the heat and intensity of this event it may seem that his earning power is limitless but you have to pull back and look at someone like tiger woods who has performed at a top level for years and years in front of the world
4909447 the olympics is only held once every four years after a year to so americans forget about the olympics and move to stars they see more kids want someone else on their wheeties box
4909448 you need to be out there early and establish your affiliation with the property michael phelps
4909449 his performance here will benefit us as it will add to the visibility we will get through this affiliation and his earning ability will increase theres no question of that
4909450 in the short term he is a gold mine because he represents everything that is pure young strong and visionary about america we havent had anyone of this significance since mark spitz
4909451 guaranteed there will be marketers wanting a piece of him that make no sense and it will interesting to see how his handlers cope with this and if they get greedy because the olympics has a narrow avenue of marketability
4909452 obviously we would look at the total picture the total character
4909453 his determination inspiration what hes doing you know you would put all the into that decision making
4909454 you have to consider it hes a tremendous talent and one little incident should not overshadow what he is an individual
4909455 we havent had a lot of games where we score 9 10 11 runs
4909456 its a good feeling tonight the way it worked out the offense looks good right now
4909457 for 4 5 months weve been a tough club to play against weve got to do it for six more weeks
4909458 i have to sit down and figure it out its one thing after another the fastball is not moving like i want
4909459 its stressing me its no fun right now i feel like im letting my team down
4909460 hey old man how much did the day money pay
4909461 let us see if the blue haired lady will fall
4909462 i had a numerous people on the redskins team tell me man it almost dont look right
4909463 like starting all over again i had some feelings i hadnt felt in 17 years
4909464 he was able to move the team down the field and put us in a position to score
4909465 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4909466 all it takes is an imagination thats something ive learned and something that has helped me
4909467 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4909468 we hopped on the flight to honolulu still pinching ourselves to make sure this was really happening
4909469 it all happened so fast one moment we were selling long distance air time the next minute our idea of air time was how long it would take to fly to samoa
4909470 all of our preparation came to a screeching halt all because some light bulbs werent working
4909471 we were shocked and thrilled ive never run so fast in my life
4909472 mike was looking a bit ragged but i looked good
4909473 we went over our presentation one last time trying to get into the mind set as to how a true samoan would give the presentation
4909474 the samoans do things with a great deal of trust and understanding of the people involved
4909475 because of our due diligence we knew that providing a detailed legal agreement might have actually worked against us so the clincher was more about the fact that we came across as sincere and honest
4909476 he was a kind gentle person concerned that what we wanted to do was in the best interest of his people
4909477 i felt we had given it our best shot but it just wasnt meant to be

4909484 the easiest way for your children to learn about money is for you not to have any
4909485 im living so far beyond my income that we may almost be said to be living apart
4909486 you should always live within your income even if you have to borrow to do so
4909487 one of the strange things about life is that the poor who need money the most are the very ones who never have it
4909488 ive got all the money ill ever need if i die by four oclock this afternoon
4909489 they say i wasted my money i say 90 went on women fast cars and booze it was the rest i wasted
4909490 my problem lies in reconciling my gross habits with my net income

4909506 do not be fooled into believing that because a man is rich he is necessarily smart there is ample proof to the contrary
4909507 if you want to know what god thinks of money just look at the people he gave it to
4909508 no matter how rich you become how famous or powerful when you die the size of your funeral will still pretty much depend on the weather

4909551 ganz im gegenteil wir wollen sehr gerne wissen was so jemand zu sagen hat aber er muss in seinem text offenlegen wer er ist
4909552 aber das ist auch im mainstream journalismus m glich der unterschied ist wir tun nicht so als seien wir unfehlbar
4909553 if i had known then what i know now about the weapons of mass destruction
4909554 a mistake by the most obvious criteria if we had known then what we know now we would never have gone to war with iraq
4909555 that iraq and the region around it could be even bloodier and more chaotic after americans leave
4909556 in fact gone way down over the past five years

4909559 we think the states case is going to have some problems that are going to come out at trial
4909560 the case was re evaluated and we looked at everything circumstances of the case and the history of the defendant
4909561 and it was determined that it was an appropriate case to proceed and ask the jury for the death penalty
4909562 we believe this is going to be a hotly contested case on whether or not he is guilty
4909563 this is a joint venture among denoon lumber the jefferson county joint vocational school the herald star and river valley paper

4909568 i heard a son of one of my dads friends who was a page talking about it and that got me interested and we called congressman wilsons office
4909569 it was a biographical sketch that could only be 200 words long
4909570 people think that as a page you only serve the congressman who sponsored you you serve the entire congress
4909571 when you were on overtime there was no telling when you would get out of there
4909572 one night we were there until 11 30 at night
4909573 when congress is adjourned the cameras are off so the only people to witness the protest were the pages and other people on the floor
4909574 manasa reddy did such a nice job on capitol hill while maintaining her good grades that she was asked to stay for a second session im so proud of her and proud of the way shes representing our district in washington
4909575 i learned a lot about how government works about how they debate over bills
4909576 everything looks so boring on c span but it really isnt i got to see what goes on behind the scenes and how people work in the congressional offices
4909577 it wasnt until i became a page that i became more interested i was very surprised i didnt expect congress to be like that it was pretty cool i did not expect it to be as much fun as it was
4909578 ive already been told that september is a very very busy time and to expect to be there very late
4909579 but then in october and november it wont be so busy because people will be off campaigning
4909580 last year we played on mondays at belleview park but then i took the code enforcement job and wasnt sure i could do this again but my kids and some of the other kids started asking about playing baseball again so police chief bill mccafferty allowed me to adjust my thursday schedule to have time for these kids
4909581 we moved to jim wood because it was more accessible for the kids who are coming from different areas of the county there is a playground area so the mothers who come can bring their other kids or they walk on the track and it is just a great family environment here
4909582 but that first thursday i came a little early and i looked up and saw about 50 kids streaming down the hill and thought what have i gotten myself into this year
4909583 i wanted to be here when my son was learning baseball there werent enough men here so several of us organized our schedules so we could help
4909584 they have been learning we play on another field to give them a chance to play and have fun and we are also learning from them they are learning to catch throw and bat they wanted to add a second day of baseball but its hard with our work schedules
4909585 and the kids encourage each other this is pure baseball where these kids know more about baseball than me this young man luke karaba is one of my many assistant coaches he is great
4909586 i play a lot of baseball at home we usually have a family baseball game on saturdays or sundays i like to pitch and my favorite team is the cleveland indians
4909587 i just try to make it nice for the kids let them have fun and learn the game
4909588 im going deep get ready this one is going deep
4909589 we try to build each other up when we are here on the field we dont want to discourage each other if a mistake is made but encourage one another this is a good group of kids they are excited to play and to spend time together
4909590 after our first year a steubenville little league coach called me and offered us catchers equipment tons of helmets and a box of new baseballs and bats so we are better prepared this year the city recreation department has been great to us we have had a lot of cooperation from everyone
4909591 i can flip a coin and we can go with that
4909592 the boys have been talking about holding weekly football games this fall most of them go to daily mass and see danny abramowicz a catholic central high school football star and former professional football player at the mass they want to ask him if he can teach them the basics and some football plays so that may be a possibility in the future
4909593 this is a great opportunity for my sons they roll out of bed early on thursdays excited to come here and play baseball this is good wholesome fun and they look forward to these games every week
4909594 this is old fashioned baseball where the kids can play and have fun there is no pressure to win here just play and enjoy themselves
4909595 they are very motivated to join their friends here and it is a good atmosphere for them
4909596 that will go into the home school hall of fame some day maybe i should sign it
4909597 hey when you home school you start school early so lets be here thursday and have a good game now take off your hats and let us pray we thank you father god for today and for watching over us and we pray that we can continue to grow as young men of god and we can return next week

4909600 for every person who brings in a quilt i try to find out a little of the history and type it up
4909601 theres just a lot of people who are involved and were glad we can make it a free event for the community
4909602 finding my voice my story in london photos of celebs at apple lounge grand opening in west hollywood photo of simon rex at the apple lounge grand opening in west hollywood photos of the elvis street party at elvisly yours in london
4909603 people were looking for bad news and didnt get it
4909604 the increase was small but the prediction direction was flat to down
4909605 for future months we know automotive production is going to fall
4909606 to the extent that exports are helping to boost industrial production that boost might be short lived given some indications of slowdown in global growth
4909607 but in a sense thats a good thing we had better weather so people used less energy
4909608 if you look at the history of where capacity utilization is in a recession its usually down in the low 70s so you could argue that the numbers in this report taken broadly are not flashing recession
4909609 three out of the four are pretty clearly flashing recession so if someone wants to up weight this one it sounds like cherry picking
4909610 if its so bad why are we not in a deep deep recession
4909611 probably many of these people werent of age in the 1970s to be able to remember what it was like and compare it to today
4909612 there are some tantalizing little hints from the fundamentals that maybe the economy isnt falling completely out of bed
4909613 still theres plenty to be watchful about with respect to the consumer
4909614 the fear of what god might become if we let him
4909615 gee ive sure got a lot of virtuous stuff going on here
4909616 take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents 29for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath 30and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
4909617 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
4909618 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4909619 the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge
4909620 if we can force the other side to do things our way it wont matter if they see things our way
4909621 my evil plan to save the world just you wait til its unfurled itll go down in history
4909622 what youre doing is wrong and sinful and you should stop
4909623 it seems to me that sin is a concept that can only be understood properly in spiritual terms something the world cannot comprehend
4909624 i would simply suggest that we not struggle too much with getting someone who by his very nature cant understand sin or its gravity to stop sinning
4909625 the world must simply trust us when we speak of grace
4909626 one of the foremost laws in the country as well as in the bible is against murder and heres the kicker if abortion truly is murder then it should be illegal period
4909627 homosexuality is shown to be irresolvably harmful to society at large so it is not a thing that the government should promote by for example allowing them to get married and adopt children
4909628 flash fiction now that im a robot by ralph gamelli
4909629 its a killer its the bomb its the best thing i ever wrote
4909630 i think we were meant to find it and make something out of it
4909631 im happy for brian i know hes in heaven i know ill see him
4909632 things i have muttered under my breath at my parents
4909633 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me
4909634 you can either have your spine fused or take pain meds
4909635 during the visit he climbed into my arms and fell asleep with his head on my shoulder while i walked around with him
4909636 when i first got here i would break down crying once a week just thinking about everything thats happened
4909637 you would be hard pressed to find a detained immigrant in the united states who did not constantly feel that they were being punished a second or third time for the same mistakes solely due to their immigration status including lawful permanent residents like tatyana
4909638 the child has already been separated from the parent if the conviction is recent enough or the parent has already suffered time in prison and then it happens a second time and again there is a separation from the child
4909639 they considered me inadequate and worthless and told me so all the time
4909640 i really thought i could deal with my problems on my own
4909641 they offered counseling and even when cps child protective services got involved i never accepted it because i was afraid they would take my baby away
4909642 the goals of that family court conflicted with the goals of the immigration court which were to determine whether or not someone in tatyanas position deserved a second chance in the united states
4909643 one way to preserve more families is to prevent child maltreatment an overwhelming body of research on the negative effect of poverty on children tells us that generous public support of child welfare would dramatically reduce cases of child abuse and neglect
4909644 for hundreds of years we have addressed problems largely related to poverty by way of mass incarceration of people of color and expansion of a prison industrial complex similarly rather than engage in meaningful immigration reform we destroy families create fatherless and motherless children by detaining immigrants then forcibly ship them to countries many of them have not seen since they were a few years old
4909645 welfare reform impacted primarily black and latina women once it became clear to korean business owners that this is going to affect their mothers and elderly too it did provide the space for people to work across race and across issue there has to be an increased level of solidarity work and the people involved in child welfare would have to have been involved
4909646 if the employer commits abuses workers are unlikely to complain
4909647 dismissal from the job and other retaliation for complaints mean the worker is left without any legal means to earn income the tfw temporary foreign worker cannot legally cross the street and find a new job the process to change the work permit to a new employer will take months the work permit is the single largest disincentive to lodge a complaint
4909648 the larger battle is brewing at the political level until there is government monitoring and enforcement of work permits and conditions of employment promised by employers the abuse will continue
4909649 this issue is getting bigger and bigger for me this is really challenging first of all when i was organizing the skytrain workers they were so fearful of losing their job and being sent home most of them know their rights but they are willing to sacrifice their rights knowing that they can apply for landed immigrant status after two years
4909650 most of them want to earn money so that they can send it home which is a substantial amount in local currency they are also isolated and dont trust anyone theyre worried about money or money that they borrowed just to come to canada this is a difficult environment to organize in many issues are driven underground
4909651 i blame the labor movement for not being proactive on this early enough because it was primarily a womens issue first with domestic workers
4909652 this immigration opportunity has been here mostly live in caregivers who were filipino women but now its the farm workers hotel workers construction and health care workers it is a broader issue now the labor movement has been complacent to address this in a broader way this really requires an international campaign
4909653 abuses are happening every day we need to concentrate on how we can help people no matter what their status we need to reach out to these people that they are not alone and that the labor movement will help them fight for their own rights
4909654 im not suggesting that everybody that is making over 250 000 is living on easy street
4909655 but the question that i think we have to ask ourselves is if we believe in good schools if we believe in good roads if we want to make sure that kids can go to college if we dont want to leave a mountain of debt for the next generation then weve got to pay for these things they dont come for free and it is irresponsible i believe it is irresponsible intergenerationally for us to invest or for us to spend 10 billion a month on a war and not having a way to pay for it that i think is unacceptable
4909656 since when is being thoughtful a negative how can being thoughtful mean that you lose
4909657 even if i were the most bearish man on earth i cant imagine buying puts 50 percent below the price with just over a week to expiration
4909658 its not even on the page of rational behavior unless you know something
4909659 would you buy 1 7 million worth of lottery tickets just because you could no neither would a hedge fund manager
4909660 an incredible amount of bearish activity could have been generated by just 10 to 15 people
4909661 other people then pile in because they think somebody knows something
4909662 in just one tick the companys share price lost nearly all its value a steeper drop than enrons right before its de listing in 2001
4909663 ive never seen a stock perform like that in my life
4909664 nobody prepares for the stock going from 57 to 3 in just two days
4909665 lots of reasons why people could have a financial motivation to induce panic
4909666 somebody placed some big bets that day that paid off
4909667 nobody in their right mind would buy that put unless you knew what was going down
4909668 when you buy 5 strikes when the stock is trading over 50 you either have to be manipulating or you have to have insider information
4909669 it looks to me like bear stearns got riddled with bullets
4909670 daniele ci scatta una foto ed insieme a noi ce maryd che fa sempre un gran piacere rivederla e farci 2 risate

4909672 eleven thousand years ago a god was born cursed into the body of a human acheron endured a lifetime of hatred his human death unleashed an unspeakable horror that almost destroyed the earth brought back against his will he became the sole defender of mankind only it was never that simple for centuries he has fought for our survival and hidden a past he never wants revealed now his survival and ours hinges on the very woman who threatens him old enemies reawaken and unite to kill them both war has never been more deadly or more fun
4909673 what in the world do they do at harry potter conventions read they cant have too much fun they are just nerds

4909676 200 for 2 weeks is that supposed to make me feel better
4909677 nobody better look at me the wrong way today or i will go off on their ass
4909678 this is a vast expansion of the technology and a vast change in the goal of the technology
4909679 the technology has reached the point where its very good now it puts a tool in the hands of police officers out in the street to help fight terrorism
4909680 theyre talking about our taxes going down and all the money slots would bring to the county
4909681 its also a stalled undertaking and its a secret undertaking this hasnt been a process so far that we can have a lot of confidence in
4909682 nothing like this has ever been done and we have to really be careful because were dealing with peoples lives were dealing with peoples privacy
4909683 even though curtis is not here to witness that i think for his familys sake to know because they always believed in him
4909684 i was convinced 33 years ago that he was innocent
4909685 the dna analysis has led us to a new suspect but this does not exonerate moore
4909686 this was the one holding her down or holding a gun to her head while the other two had their way
4909687 they always seem to be happy because theyre there and theyve done their best
4909688 theyre watching how the olympians behave more than how they perform
4909689 theyre just looking for cues in how to behave as an adult
4909690 what people are seeing at the olympics are the things that kids who are really in swimming see all the time
4909691 the way phelps touched the wall the other night that happens a lot of times and sometimes we only have a stopwatch its not always the kid who touches first who wins
4909692 its good for young kids to see how other swimmers behave in these situations
4909693 i like to smile when i win and i dont smile when i lose
4909694 phelps is great but in some ways i think the kids are surprised hes gotten all of the attention
4909695 they say to me there are so many really good swimmers out there they should all get some attention
4909696 america after eight years of the bush administration is ready for excellence
4909697 i dont have any illusions about it i dont think thats likely to happen
4909698 right now were spending more effort on figuring out how to rebuild iraqs infrastructure than building our own infrastructure
4909699 it was good to hear what he wants to do about infrastructure
4909700 we cant continue to afford this we need a change
4909701 i came to be part of the crowd to show local virginia politicians that we are here and want to be taken seriously for the issues that affect us
4909702 my experience with these folks is that their concerns are just about the same as those of other people
4909703 this year there is a high likelihood a small number of voters in northern virginia will elect the next president
4909704 given that scenario i think 71 000 voters is a substantial bloc that could swing things in one direction or the other

4909717 tissue engineering is an exciting field were creating solutions to problems that can significantly impact peoples quality of life
4909718 these gels have great promise in not only regenerating bone but serving as a gene therapy delivery system
4909719 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
4909720 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
4909721 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
4909722 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
4909723 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
4909724 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
4909725 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world

4909732 the amount of running ive done coming in wasnt enough cardiovascularly i felt comfortable but my legs had gone my calf went first then it went up the entire leg and it felt like i was running on one leg but i didnt do all that work for nothing its just really frustrating
4909733 i was going to the finish line no matter what i did all the hard work and it feels frustrating because cardiovascularly i dont feel like ive run i tried to to the right things in the race tried to go after constantina but my legs werent there
4909734 i didnt feel sick or in distress but there was nothing else i could do its not the end i knew i was pushing it coming in with three and a half weeks of running you cant take shortcuts in the marathon and i guess i learned that today i dont think this is redemption for athens but it would have been for nothing if i hadnt finished

4909738 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4909739 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4909740 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4909741 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4909742 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4909743 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4909744 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4909745 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4909746 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4909747 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4909748 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
4909749 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
4909750 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
4909751 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
4909752 every weekend it seems theyre hauling one off for one reason or another
4909753 they may not all have to be euthanized but theyre definitely career ending injuries attributable to a surface thats too hard too unlevel or punching through the base owners have told me never again they wont come back
4909754 i keep my fingers crossed every time i run youve got enough to worry about without having to worry about whether theyre going to break down in a damn race my owners put a lot of money and time into this and its becoming a judgment call do we want to run on this
4909755 we have 250 to 300 owners and trainers working in this backstretch and not one of them has mentioned their concern to our racetrack manager
4909756 and now that theres a big article in the paper and theyre complaining about it its remarkable to us
4909757 the horsemen are not the ones on the track the jockeys are the ones on the track this is their livelihood they put their lives on the line every time they go out on that track if its not safe they will not do it and they tell us the track is in good shape
4909758 i attribute the complaints to people who are losing theyre losing at the track they get frustrated and like to blame it on somebody else
4909759 i took my car out there and ive never been on a smoother road
4909760 there was not a bump on that track not a bump
4909761 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4909762 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4909763 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4909764 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4909765 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4909766 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4909767 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4909768 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4909769 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4909770 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4909771 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4909772 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4909773 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4909774 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
4909775 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
4909776 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
4909777 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
4909778 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
4909779 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
4909780 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family

4909912 yes lord it is true i am a sinner and not worthy of your grace but you have promised forgiveness and did not come to call the righteous but like saint paul says in his letter to timothy 1 timothy 1 15 behold the lord must then through his own judgment have mercy on us

4909916 the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field when a man found it he hid it again and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls when he found one of great value he went away and sold everything he had and bought it
4909917 do you intend to continue steadfast in this confession and church and to suffer all even death rather than fall away from it

4909919 a farmer went out to sow his seed as he was scattering the seed some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow but when the sun came up the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root other seed fell among thorns which grew up and choked the plants still other seed fell on good soil where it produced a crop a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown he who has ears let him hear
4909920 as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater so is my word that goes out from my mouth it will not return to me empty but will accomplish what i desire and achieve the purpose for which i sent it
4909921 listen then to what the parable of the sower means when anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart this is the seed sown along the path the one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy but since he has no root he lasts only a short time when trouble or persecution comes because of the word he quickly falls away the one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it making it unfruitful but the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it he produces a crop yielding a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown
4909922 will not return to me empty but will accomplish what i desire and achieve the purpose for which i sent it

4909977 i have been very zealous for the lord god almighty the israelites have rejected your covenant broken down your altars and put your prophets to death with the sword i am the only one left and now they are trying to kill me too

4909979 be a sinner and sin boldly but believe and rejoice in christ even more boldly pray boldly you too are a mighty sinner
4909980 no people has ever been so abandoned as not to establish and carry on some sort of divine worship everyone set up as his special god whatever he looked for blessings help and comfort thus for example the heathen who put their trust in power and dominion raised their jupiter to the position of supreme god the others who were bent on riches happiness or pleasure and a life of ease exalted hercules mercury venus or others women with child would worship diana or lucina so they would carry on everyone made that his god to which his heart inclined therefore even according to the opinion of the heathen to have a god really means to trust and believe but their error is that their trust is false and wrong for it is not placed in the only god besides whom there is actually no god in heaven or on earth
4909981 this is what the lord says israels king and redeemer the lord almighty i am the first and i am the last apart from me there is no god
4909982 who then is like me let him proclaim it let him declare and lay out before me what has happened since i established my ancient people and what is yet to come yes let him foretell what will come
4909983 do not tremble do not be afraid did i not proclaim this and foretell it long ago you are my witnesses is there any god besides me no there is no other rock i know not one
4909984 be a sinner and sin boldly but believe and rejoice in christ even more boldly pray boldly you too are a mighty sinner
4909985 jesus heard what had happened he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place

4909988 a missionary to india wrote it was night when we i on my motorcycle and a native catechist in the side car entered the forest road leading into the jungle a ranger had warned me of the presence of a herd of wild elephants which he said were somewhere in the thicket near the road ahead pulling down trees i also had reason to fear other wild animals but i could not stop a storm came up soon the lightning flashed cruelly and the thunder rolled incessantly i did not dare stop to light my carbide lamp for fear of being charged by some lurking beast but kept right on into the jungle seeing the road only by the ever repeated streaks of lightning suddenly there came out of the darkness to my right the piercing terrifying trumpet of an elephant had the beast seen us was he going to charge my hairs stood on end with the throttle opened wide i raced on through the night all at once the catechist reached out his hand laid it on my arm and said jesus is with us how comforting was that word in that moment yes jesus was indeed with us and brought us safely through the terrors of that ride
4909989 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword as it is written for your sake we face death all day long we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us for i am convinced that neither death nor life neither angels nor demons neither the present nor the future nor any powers neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord
4909990 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

4909993 be a sinner and sin boldly but believe and rejoice in christ even more boldly pray boldly you too are a mighty sinner
4909994 what shall we say then shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase by no means we died to sin how can we live in it any longer or dont you know that all of us who were baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death we were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father we too may live a new life
4909995 if you are a preacher of grace then preach a true and not a fictitious grace if grace is true you must bear a true and not a fictitious sin god does not save people who are only fictitious sinners be a sinner and sin boldly but believe and rejoice in christ even more boldly for he is victorious over sin death and the world as long as we are here in this world we have to sin this life is not the dwelling place of righteousness but as peter says we look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells it is enough that by the riches of gods glory we have come to know the lamb that takes away the sin of the world no sin will separate us from the lamb even though we commit fornication and murder a thousand times a day do you think that the purchase price that was paid for the redemption of our sins by so great a lamb is too small pray boldly you too are a mighty sinner
4909996 on whose shoulders and not on mine lie all my sins
4909997 if we have been united with him like this in his death we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection for we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with that we should no longer be slaves to sin because anyone who has died has been freed from sin now if we died with christ we believe that we will also live with him for we know that since christ was raised from the dead he cannot die again death no longer has mastery over him the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god in the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus
4909998 be a sinner and sin boldly but believe and rejoice in christ even more boldly for he is victorious over sin death and the world
4909999 be a sinner and sin boldly but believe and rejoice in christ even more boldly pray boldly you too are a mighty sinner
