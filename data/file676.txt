6760349 explaining the real meaning of holidays to children is important
6760350 the easter bunny did not die for my sins or the sins of the world only jesus christ his blood and his holy power
6760351 the easter bunny is a pagan belief and has no place in christianity
6760352 if you tell your children that there is an easter bunny and a santa claus then they find out that they are not real and you attempt to tell them about jesus and they cant see him either they wont believe he exists
6760353 we have freedom in christ jesus so it doesnt matter
6760354 a parent is responsible to share with the child the reason for the holiday and the sacrifice jesus made but i see no reason for our kids not to enjoy coloring and hunting for eggs
6760355 i think its fine because it is a good time for the kids and you can even teach them about christ rising using the eggs and jelly beans
6760356 each christian has his or her own beliefs they have to decide for themselves
6760357 i dont think so because i think that it detracts from the real message of easter but it is pretty harmless fun for small children
6760358 jesus would want people to have fun on the holiday i may not talk about a magical bunny but there are reasons a parent can give for the eggs and new life

6760416 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies

6760444 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6760445 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6760446 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6760447 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6760448 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6760449 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6760450 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6760451 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6760452 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6760453 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6760454 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6760455 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6760456 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6760457 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6760458 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6760459 many companies including large ones such as xerox offer products and machines which limit the damage to the environment our service faxser eliminates the environmental impact
6760460 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6760461 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6760462 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6760463 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6760464 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6760465 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6760466 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6760467 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6760468 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6760469 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6760470 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6760471 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6760472 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6760473 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6760474 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6760475 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6760476 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6760477 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6760478 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6760479 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6760480 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6760481 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6760482 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6760483 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6760484 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6760485 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6760486 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6760487 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6760488 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6760489 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6760490 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6760491 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6760492 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6760493 who are open to doing something on the production side
6760494 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6760495 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6760496 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6760497 the most significant feature of onyx 174 154 is the battery backup function this function is essential to hospital cart applications they could last for 30 minutes if the external power supply has been shut down for medical security purposes the onyx 174 154 can be integrated with finger print scan and rfid for higher security to guard after patients medical records and treatments the onyx 174 154 has been designed for practical medical demands and considerations a few examples are lower than 35db noise detection latex free and toxin free outer frame design and optional medical resistive touch screen moreover the onyx 174 154 also fulfill the high telemedicine demands through bundling with web camera and skype phone
6760498 the new analytics and reporting capabilities in inquisite 9 0 have certainly made it easier and faster for our organization to better understand our key constituents
6760499 because the reports and charts are interactive i simply point and click on a variable to drill down into more detail and i can now quickly generate a single customized report to present all necessary data rather than needing to create separate reports inquisite software has never been more simple or powerful
6760500 almost all significant business processes should have a feedback loop
6760501 version 9 0 of our survey software continues inquisites commitment to delivering powerful yet easy to use software facilitating the gathering and sharing of feedback the new analytics and reporting capabilities give our customers immediate access to and control of the information they need allowing them to make accurate and informed decisions about their own customers employees and partners based upon the opinions and needs expressed
6760502 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6760503 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6760504 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6760505 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6760506 our second annual inc 5000 continues the most ambitious project in business journalism
6760507 the inc 5000 gives an unrivalled portrait of young underreported companies across all industries doing fascinating things with cutting edge business models as well as older companies that are still showing impressive growth
6760508 we were thrilled to see our name when the results of the 2008 inc 5000 list were announced
6760509 this is another major achievement in an already banner year bridgelogix experienced record growth in 2007 was awarded by managing automation for technology advancements and now this recognition bridgelogix believes these accomplishments reflect deep understanding of our market a suite of functionally rich yet user friendly solutions stellar customer service and perhaps the most important unparallel hard work and commitment from every single employee of bridgelogix in the us europe india
6760510 awards such as these are motivators to top our previous performance and to continually provide robust and reputable solutions to the infor erp community
6760511 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6760512 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6760513 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6760514 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6760515 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6760516 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6760517 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6760518 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6760519 the tall peaceful trees would be like the pipes of a great organ
6760520 evokes the rolling centuries in all their pain and beauty leaving us at once becalmed and energised but never oppressed under the weight of time
6760521 the event seemed provoking and iconoclastic in contrast to the severe and austere atmosphere of the cathedral though some of the musical pieces were audacious the music focused mainly on spirituality it generated a different perception of the organ pieces thus modifying our perception of the cathedral and making the event truly exceptional
6760522 imagine the electric guitar severed from clich and all of its physical limitations shaping a bold new musical language

6760526 uno dei sette angeli che stanno innanzi a dio e che hanno accesso alla maest del signore
6760527 sono venuto per farti volgere gli occhi in pure dottrine e in pura saggezza e per renderti familiari le parole di questo libro sacro adamo fatti coraggio non darti pena e non aver paura prendi questo libro dalle mie mani e servitene con precauzione poich da esso attingerai il sapere e lo farai conoscere a chi di esso degno e a colui al quale destinato adamo lo custod in santit e purezza
6760528 its a very individual choice it helps to bond with the kids if you take care of the kids the kids will feel closer to you and you can really enjoy the time together
6760529 i have heard of cases where the guy does not help out so the lady gets very frustrated its like after the first one they dont want anymore because the load is just too much
6760530 it wouldnt necessarily effect the kind of changes that we would like to see in terms of procreation behaviour because the primary concern here is a much larger issue
6760531 we have to really go towards a general mindset shift where men would want to be more involved fathers because they see the rewards of fathering the culture of fatherhood has certainly shifted but the practice of fatherhood is still lagging behind
6760532 these areas are things that are more forward looking as affluence grows these are areas where consumers want to spend more so these are very strategic places to be when growth is taking off
6760533 we will find that constructions share of gdp will be higher over the next two to three years youll find thats the one sector that will continue to generate job opportunities for locals and foreigners as well
6760534 from the manufacturing point of view we will probably see that the more specialized areas of biomed will lead well be positioned well to take off
6760535 for singapore its still very much tied to global growth it may mean we see a period of below trend growth or even recessionary conditions as global demand slows sharply but like previous periods after each downturn we should see a big rebound
6760536 people probably didnt think i would get far because of where im from
6760537 being able to do what ive always wanted to do my entire life is a gift and my whole dream has come true to see where i am from where i was is just crazy
6760538 almost every scene we did selena would say oh my gosh were shooting a movie right now and then it just hit us we met each other the day we started working on our careers so its pretty ironic how things turn out
6760539 everyone on the disney channel is really uplifting people try to pit me against miley but she sent me a four page text saying how she knows its overwhelming right now and she wants to help
6760540 the european commission acted quickly and immediately after the conflict broke provided its first humanitarian assistance
6760541 we are now releasing additional funds following the united nations appeal and on the basis of our own assessment of the humanitarian situation on the spot
6760542 however access to the conflict affected areas remains the most serious difficulty i call upon the russian authorities to ensure that humanitarian aid workers have full and safe access to the people in need
6760543 i dont know if its our immediate future its something we talk about every few months
6760544 its something we would never take lightly and just say that would be fun its a lot of work and we recognise that
6760545 more proof of the vast left conspiracy out to stop hillary
6760546 your pain is my pain my wealth is your wealth your salvation is my salvation
6760547 our students use computers in their everyday life from completing homework to sending messages to friends so why shouldnt they stay informed on their financial matters through the same format
6760548 it has become a common practice to view ones checking account and pay bills electronically so we believe this will be another way for them to handle their business affairs more efficiently
6760549 we will continue to remind students who have a balance
6760550 life gets so complicated that we all need reminders by sending a monthly reminder that they have an account balance current students will always know when their account reflects a balance
6760551 the e bills will go to the students campus e mail account in the past bills have been mailed to home addresses where many parents have assumed the responsibility of paying the balance
6760552 we believe this will help the student stay abreast of his or her financial obligations
6760553 most other universities use this method of providing information which has been well received
6760554 the athletes from the united states have exceeded our goals already
6760555 overall we look at this as one of the great successes in u s olympic history
6760556 we had anticipated that would be the case coming in considering the resources they had placed in a very targeted manner to win the gold medal count
6760557 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
6760558 its going to be very difficult to dislodge china the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be
6760559 were not displeased at where we are in the gold medal count
6760560 well learn from this well learn from the chinese but with the resources that weve had available weve done remarkably well
6760561 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
6760562 i would say at these games we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes of the results but were not disappointed in any team or any individual athlete
6760563 the conduct of athletes all around has been what they said they were going to do to respect our hosts respect our country and do their best
6760564 nobody else in any walk of life is able to do that
6760565 the olympic movement is testimony that the world can get to know each other i think history will say these games found a a new level though the efforts of the chinese people
6760566 i think the chicago team has done very very well and the olympic family realizes the quality of their effort and the quality of their bid
6760567 its a very weak position for the u s but our two ioc members are very special
6760568 six tibetan separatists showed the flag of the separatist movement and cried slogans
6760569 the police in order to prevent the aggravation of the situation and prevent any possible injuries to the pedestrians took the six separatists to the station for investigation
6760570 if precarious work is not controlled it will lead to the destruction of unions and exploitation of workers wage increases are undermined by precarious employment and this has placed severe hardship on the working community we will carry on fighting this issue no matter how long it takes

6760572 the green valley prospect is the first of several oil and gas drilling prospects that surge is looking to acquire and drill green valley is on trend and has similar geology to the highly successful grant canyon field that produced over 20 million barrels of oil surge will utilize existing cash on hand to fund drilling operations
6760573 i was waiting for this day and finally i see the russians leaving my home town im so happy
6760574 the distribution of food and hygiene kits went well that is just one day but its a step in the right direction
6760575 steer anger among the population which can be channelled toward the government of this country
6760576 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6760577 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
6760578 very many people are still not aware that there is a global sanitation crisis
6760579 policy makers and opinion leaders have never suffered the lack of adequate sanitation and if they have it is too long ago to remember the undignified inhumane circumstances these people use a fancy toilet which is connected to an effective sewer system and they are probably unaware that this toilet and its flushing system are critical to a healthy life unsgab will continue to call a spade a spade or perhaps i should say a toilet a toilet
6760580 the financial aspect should and can not be a barrier
6760581 since rural sanitation is not specifically identified in the eu directives
6760582 often new member states have no resources left to allocate to this issue
6760583 in germany famers are spraying illegal and highly dangerous pesticides in unbelievable quantities
6760584 many of our farmers are operating a shady business because they want to save money with the illegal agricultural poison
6760585 its a scandal that the highest german food standards agency doesnt research illegal pesticides
6760586 and instead of taking action against criminal farmers and retailers the minister of agriculture and the administration are cloaking the problems in secrecy
6760587 national report on food monitoring2 contains 14 942 foodstuffs complied by the ministry of consumer affairs and food safety
6760588 it has seemed to me fit and proper that the gifts of god should be solemnly reverently and gratefully acknowledged with one heart and one voice by the whole american people i do therefore invite my fellow citizens to set apart and observe the last thursday of november next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent father who dwelleth in the heavens
6760589 success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm
6760590 you can be anything you want to be do anything you set out to accomplish if you hold to that desire with singleness of purpose
6760591 most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be
6760592 no matter what happens today make up your mind to be happy dammit
6760593 all my friends keep saying you should try to hook up with shawn johnson
6760594 they said youre not good enough for him and youre ugly
6760595 you can see why people want to keep things to themselves
6760596 it is silly shes in no way my muse but she is one of the great american actresses
6760597 im just a big believer in you must love yourself before you can love anybody else and i think for me that breeds the most inspired relationships
6760598 its hard for me to have any proclamation about the right kind of love or how to love because relationships are so complicated and there are so many ways to love on one hand theres obsessive love and committed love and the love that friends just have for one another
6760599 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
6760600 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved

6760607 i would never disrespect a colleague and friend with that kind of language its disappointing someone would intentionally misrepresent the hard work jenna and i are doing
6760608 tiki and jenna were discussing total medal count versus gold medal counts and tikis words were unclear
6760609 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6760610 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6760611 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6760612 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6760643 nossos amigos de gaza nos pediram para trazer 9 000 aparelhos de audi o para crian as mas conseguimos trazer apenas 2 000
6760644 na faixa de gaza existe um problema s rio muitas crian as ficaram surdas em decorr ncia do barulho cont nuo de explos es e choques ultra s nicos causados por ca as israelenses que sobrevoam freq entemente a regi o
6760645 tenho certeza de que israel vai impedir a nossa entrada na faixa de gaza
6760646 mas acho que do ponto de vista da lei internacional n o tem o direito de faz lo
6760647 eles podem revistar nossos barcos e procurar armas que obviamente n o v o achar mas n o podem nos impedir de entrar na regi o
6760648 se impedirem vai ficar claro que o bloqueio imposto por israel faixa de gaza n o apenas militar mas sim civil
6760649 a vantagem de uma a o n o violenta que de qualquer maneira se ganha se conseguirmos quebrar o cerco ganharemos e mesmo se formos presos ganharemos pois estaremos expondo a cara da ocupa o e o fato de que israel ainda est ocupando gaza

6760683 russia del 1999 e quella odierna non sono lo stesso paese affatto
6760684 la guerra fredda non mai finita lamerica considera la russia come un nemico indipendentemente dal fatto che essa sia un paese comunista o democratico
6760685 cristallino che senza una serie di sostegni stranieri il presidente georgiano mikhail saakashvili nonostante la sua instabilit mentale non avrebbe preso il rischio di metter in atto questo piano
6760686 lamerica ha fornito le armi continua rogozin ha finanziato il tutto e ha istruito i vertici dellesercito della georgia proprio prima dellattacco lesercito georgiano e quello americano hanno condotto unesercitazione congiunta non sappiamo nemmeno se lesercito americano abbia lasciato la georgia prima dellinizio dellaggressione di saakashvili
6760687 come ben sapete da anni sosteniamo lintegrit territoriale sia della serbia che della georgia ma dopo il massacro georgiano dubitiamo del fatto che gli osseti e gli abkhazi possano vivere insieme ai georgiani
6760688 nel primo caso gli albanesi hanno diviso una terra assolutamente serba diventando maggioranza in seguito allesodo della popolazione serba costretta a fuggire da criminali sostenuti dalla nato nel secondo caso la georgia cerca di conservare un territorio che non le mai spettato solo un regalo ricevuto dal georgiano stalin ai tempi dellunione sovietica

6760690 the chinese culture is changing and evolving so to be immersed in it is a rare opportunity
6760691 until recently the business analyst was not viewed as part of the critical path to success
6760692 the idea of a linear life cycle with most emphasis placed on development and testing automatically overlooked or discounted the important work being done by the analyst as more mature and optimized enterprises move from a linear life cycle to that of a global life cycle which focuses on the elimination of barriers between it and the line of business the business analyst becomes crucial in delivering an optimized business outcome without the business analyst gathering and delivering requirements from and to the appropriate stakeholders the life cycle becomes heavily focused on development with rework done during the testing phase
6760693 the market snapshot showed that 91 of business analysts use tools that are ineffective and static the most common tool being word
6760694 business analysts are clear in the types of dynamic functionality they need in their tools and how the tools need to work together at key intersection points in the life cycle such as requirements definition and test

6760703 ogni qualvolta ha osservato si parla di riforma sulla giustizia c un pezzo della magistratura che si fa prendere da una crisi di nervi
6760704 falcone fu emarginato da magistrature democratiche e attaccato dalla sinistra
6760705 oltretutto nulla hanno di giuridico poich non v alcun testo sul punto e sono quindi levidente frutto di un mero pregiudizio e della volont di contrastare utilizzando il proprio ruolo lattuale maggioranza e loperato del presidente del consiglio
6760706 a isolare di pietro che farebbe bene a non parlare di falcone e a non occuparsi di giustizia
6760707 il teorico della carcerazione preventiva come strumento per la confessione di fatti rivelatisi poi quasi sempre penalmente irrilevanti
6760708 la separazione delle carriere tra pm e giudici il degrado clientelare dellanm e di conseguenza del csm e la necessit di superare il feticcio dellobbligatoriet dellazione penale lasciata di fatto alla discrezionalit dei capi degli uffici o peggio dei singoli magistrati in assenza di un responsabile della politica criminale
6760709 ero e sono daccordo ha aggiunto con falcone in particolare lattuale assetto dellanm e di conseguenza del csm sono indifendibili
6760710 falcone boll come antistorico il tentativo di continuare a considerare la magistratura unitariamente disconoscendo la specificit delle funzioni requirenti rispetto a quelle giudicanti
6760711 un organismo sempre pi diretto alla tutela di interessi corporativi e sempre meno il luogo di difesa e di affermazione dei valori della giurisdizione con le correnti dellanm trasformate in macchine elettorali per il csm
6760712 individu dei problemi ma non indic delle linee di soluzione sulle risposte da dare ha concluso il parlamento sovrano dovr scegliere il legislatore limportante che si intervenga con misura ed equilibrio
6760713 chiaro che un problema c la magistratura ha due profili uno di potere dello stato e laltro di servizio per i cittadini vanno rivisti entrambi mentre sinora mi pare che gli interventi abbiano riguardato prevalentemente laspetto del potere
6760714 occorrerebbe aggiungere una quota di personalit particolarmente qualificate nominate direttamente dal presidente della repubblica che garantiscano che non vi sia un permanente scontro tra politica e giustizia
6760715 credo ha spiegato che debba essere il capo dello stato che il presidente del csm a scegliersi il vice e non pi trovarselo eletto dal csm tra i membri scelti del parlamento
6760716 after fresh violence curfew was imposed in hiranagar this afternoon the clashes between police and protesters are going on

6760718 sono arrivato qua molto in forma ha spiegato luomo che riportato la marcia italiana ad un successo olimpico nella 50 km 44 anni dopo abdon pamich mi sono allenato molto bene durante tutto lanno e sono andato in gara per vincere sono stato tranquillo fino a tre quarti del percorso pensando solo a stare con i primi poi quando ho visto che gli altri faticavano me ne sono andato
6760719 quando sei superiore gareggiare facile il difficile quando non sei pronto oggi sono entrato in gara sapendo quello che volevo e dovevo fare
6760720 al rifornimento non ho pi visto lombra dietro di me
6760721 ero euforico e in questi casi si rischia di fare anche qualche cavolata ma sono felice di aver fatto contento anche tutta litalia e quando ho fatto vedere il bicipite avranno riso tutti perch il mio muscolo ridicolo
6760722 stasera ha poi aggiunto schwazer per festeggiare mi prendo una bella ciucca la base sar la birra e poi piano piano salgo di gradazione
6760723 ha solo 23 anni oggi iniziata lera schwazer e per era intendo che pu vincere tre medaglie doro
6760724 e un po euforico ribalta i ruoli il neo olimpionico un passo per volta oggi mi avete visto in super condizione ma basta un problemino per far crollare tutto sui 50 km se non sei al cento per cento becchi cinque minuti dai primi bisogna prepararsi bene
6760725 io sono contento di quello che faccio ho passato gli ultimi quattro anni facendo molta fatica sono orgoglioso di questo successo perch me lo merito e perch non imbroglio ma lo sar anche se dovessi arrivare decimo in futuro
6760726 lui fa dieci volte meno fatica di me e guadagna dieci volte di pi o magari cinque ma io sono cinque volte pi felice e poi quando sono cos in forma non mi batte nemmeno superman
6760727 la dedica per tutte le persone che non si vedono in pista ma che con il loro lavoro hanno contribuito a renderlo possibile

6760743 i dont think were going to do any debt reduction for a while
6760744 its not a popular issue these days why do you think politicians in the past like whitman and mcgreevey increased the debt because the public doesnt care about it
6760745 i would like to do more we just dont have the capacity to do it
6760746 it doesnt mean that when we have capital needs such as protecting people from roads and bridges crashing and killing people that were not going to take those steps to have those kinds of investments made

6760750 things look rather dour in the markets as far as the likelihood of a credit crunch coming
6760751 we do not expect a sustained or broad based seizing up of credit without mitigating corrective action whether from official sources or in the markets repricing of risk

6760759 this is the flaw with american fans on the one hand the american fan is incredibly intelligent and gets the game and understands whats going on but literally the other hand is the other 50 percent of them are morons who have no idea what the fuck theyre talking about
6760760 to be honest he was really slippery and i dont mean that like technically wise he was really slippery
6760761 i would say the only guarantee k j has is to pull up a chair and watch the event and get comfortable on that chair because hell be sitting for a little bit

6760784 we believe this compelling combination would create a strong platform for sustainable long term growth to better address the changing health care industry and provide meaningful cost effective medicines that improve the quality of life for patients
6760785 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6760786 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6760787 including the economy jobs gas prices and energy policy were the leading concerns of more than half of those surveyed

6760821 they cannot claim to represent in a democracy without being elected our democracy gives people the option of being elected as members of parliament
6760822 i must confess that on that occasion i felt some sympathy for your position
6760823 it was a situation that attracted some publicity at the time and i wondered if it was appropriate that an asbo be given for that sort of offence
6760824 im excited to bring my emmy award winning writing to the field of animation
6760825 the costs of live action production restricted me to a set only slightly larger than the actual white house and an ensemble cast of under 15 actors but animation technology will enable us to provide fans with extended 40 minute walk and talks digitally compressed dialogue for faster delivery and a cast of over 70 main characters my vision will finally be presented in its truest most uncompromised form

6760846 one of the most tragic things i know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living we are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today

6760868 have you heard the one about the islamic comedy sketch that itv ordered its latest star to remove katy brand was the victim of humourless lawyers who instructed her to delete a harmless sounding spoof called the iman of dibley
6760869 a new iman arrives in a sleepy parish and the comedy arrives from the misunderstandings that causes but the lawyers said it might be culturally insensitive

6760871 by now i knew i had to do something so i started doing chest compressions on traceys chest while one of the paramedics tried to get the defibrilator to work monitors were showing her pulse was at zero and we were still on the driveway i couldnt give up on her even though i realised it was the beginning of the end
6760872 wmas first became involved in the treatment of mrs bereza on the evening april 11 2004 when her husband called for an ambulance
6760873 the trust wrote to mr bereza on july 22 2008 in regard to his claims about the level of care given to his wife and expressed its sincere regret
6760874 wmas is always learning from its experiences and strives constantly to find ways of improving patient care
6760875 in light of this case further inquiries into the trusts protocols were undertaken to ensure that the training and actions of staff are appropriate at all times
6760876 although tracey had suffered from asthma since childhood it was controlled most of the time
6760877 i wish id ignored this advice and taken tracey to hospital myself
6760878 this is a hollow victory for the family because despite agreeing to pay a significant sum by way of compensation the trust has not apologised to the family or accepted that its paramedics were negligent in any way
6760879 this clearly was not the case on this occasion and the evidence suggests these delays were responsible for the fatal outcome

6760917 although yeast can derive energy from a lot of different carbon sources such as fatty acids and different kinds of sugars yeast really really like glucose the sugar found in honey
6760918 thats what they will use if its there even if its there only in trace amounts
6760919 how do you get yeast to give up their habit of using only glucose no matter what else is around
6760920 yeast essentially care about glucose because they are genetically programmed that way not because there is any physiological reason they have to care about glucose
6760921 we can genetically change that program we are using genetics to modify yeast strains so that they will use other sugars just as well as glucose
6760922 you get a lot more ethanol for the same amount of work

6761042 by wilfully ignoring scientific analysis and evidence that was made available to the commission upon its own initiative the commissions recent intellectual property package does not live up to this ambition indeed the commissions obscuration of the ivir studies and its failure to confront the critical arguments made therein seem to reveal an intention to mislead the council and the parliament as well as the citizens of the european union

6761080 some reproach me for being as jew others forgive me for being one there are even those who commend me for the same but theres no one able to put this fact out of his mind
6761081 these jews spoke and wrote the common language sometimes better than their christian countrymen and lived not segregated from other germans but among them in a process analogous to freuds narcissism of minor difference the more jews came to resemble other germans the more it seemed germans resented them

6761089 the event is a great opportunity to raise money and awareness for something that is important to me
6761090 a friend of mine told me they were looking for cancer survivors who surf
6761091 while i never thought of myself as a survivor i responded to the call and was fortunate to receive an invitation to surf on the team
6761092 ive read about so many of the legends but met very few
6761093 were looking forward to another spectacular event this year thanks to all our sponsors friends and volunteers
6761094 it is only by working together that we can hope to one day overcome cancer

6761104 iype recognizes that earth can be a dangerous place as our growing world population tends to settle along the coastal and mountainous areas of the continents our communities become more vulnerable to the risks of multiple hazards

6761128 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
6761129 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
6761130 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
6761131 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option
6761132 these pumps have been used in humans for other diseases and can be designed for delivery of these drugs as well
6761133 we believe they can be used to deliver drugs to block angiogenesis in complex human tumors such as glioblastomas

6761136 large companies are putting together server farms of tens of thousands of computers even approaching 100 thousand and the big challenge is to interconnect all these computers so that they can talk to each other as quickly as possible without incurring significant costs
6761137 we are proposing a new topology for ethernet data center connectivity
6761138 our work addresses the problem of data center network connectivity in a world where consolidation is increasingly taking place in data centers
6761139 the history of computing and technology has an innumerable set of examples where commodity parts take over the functionality of more specialized pieces of equipment
6761140 but that commoditization hasnt taken place on the communications side so we do have these specialized components still living in the network infrastructure that incur significant costs and complexity
6761141 the other issue is that people are treating the data center as a mini internet
6761142 thats fine but they are then forced to use the same components they might use in the wide area network with a bunch of concerns that dont come up in the data center environment adversarial environments attacks parties that might not trust each other etc so you have a lot of functionalities in these specialized switching components that you really dont need in your data center and you wind up paying for it in dollars and in complexity
6761143 independent of whether our technique is successful or someone elses is five years from now switching and communication infrastructure in the datacenter will be based on these small commodity building blocks
6761144 one of the big benefits of our approach is that it scales trivially to 10 gige at the edge whereas competing techniques rely on aggregation to ever faster links to achieve higher speeds
6761145 if you were to go to 10 gige at the edge for servers today you would need to aggregate to 40 gige or 100 gigelinks moving up the tree topology unfortunately the 40gbps ethernet standard isnt even out yet and when it does become available it will be very expensive because were using identical network elements in our topology today 48 port 10 gige ethernet switches are becoming relatively inexpensive so we would scale trivially to that environment as well
6761146 from a cost perspective to build out a 25 000 node cluster today using current techniques with 100 percent bandwidth just the switching equipment would cost somewhere in the order of 28 million whereas with our technique using the identical network elements would deliver the same performance but incur costs of maybe 4 million thats a factor of seven difference

6761173 we were cruising along feeling like we were doing some good work feeling like we were making progress
6761174 we hadnt heard any negative reports about our police yet then we got the first report from a detainee that by name some of our guys were corrupt and it was like someone took a pin and just popped our little bubble for about three days it felt like it was a funeral it was so demoralizing youre looking ahead almost nine months before you are done doing this mission and its futile it just feels like its a waste
6761175 we had to be careful not to generalize that because one leader is corrupt that the entire organization is corrupt

6761241 barack obama addresses the controversial comments of his pastor condemning the words but not the man and he calls on all americans to work for a more perfect union
6761242 in the city of brotherly love barack obama gave the most extensive and most intensely personal speech on race he has ever given
6761243 from a reporters point of view its almost hard to remain objective because its infectious the energy i think
6761244 you can see it in the crowds the thrill the hope how they surge toward him and the question you can sense on everyones mind as they listen so intently to him is he the one
6761245 and today the audacity of hope had its rendezvous with destiny the kennedy clan anointed barack obama a son of camelot
6761246 barack obama and his wife michelle walked into historys arms last night just like jfks journey as the first catholic president america crossed a milestone one of americas oldest and ugliest color lines has been broken and theres a new bridge for a new generation
6761247 a venit la mine personal ho kim directorul tehnic al aiba i m a ntrebat care din arbitri a vrea s nu fie la meciul din sferturi dintre georgian popescu i cubanez eu i am spus c nu exist a a ceva apoi a insistat i m a ntrebat care sunt mpotriva mea eu i am spus c aici sunt din partea aiba nu sunt cu delega ia rom niei era o capcan de fapt prin care ncerca s vad ce spun eu

6761251 following in the footsteps of guitar hero and rock band the ultimate drumming application arrives on the iphone
6761252 oh yes you can make signs but you cant hoop not so important now are you
6761253 no i would say this is excellent but i would say that the gumbo was better
6761254 you would i would say that this is better than the gumbo but that that asian chicken thing was the best thing ever
6761255 because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out
6761256 its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter
6761257 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
6761258 ive never been uncomfortable with that aspect i dont feel like its beneath me to sell what i did
6761259 michael phelps is the young jeezy of the swim world
6761260 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
6761261 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
6761262 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
6761263 it would be nice to get a win before the match
6761264 hopefully wins come in bunches and it would be good to get some momentum here
6761265 i had a little chat with mickelson in akron and the americans are definitely up for it they dont want to lose four times in a row
6761266 if an independent madhu koda can run the state for one and a half year than why not shibu soren with 17 mlas in his kitty
6761267 i do not know why soren should not be inducted in union cabinet
6761268 when matters are related to the emotions of the people we should try to solve them as quickly as possible i think we will be able to solve this matter in a very short time
6761269 that is exactly what we are trying to do and we would like to accept a formula which is acceptable to both people living in jammu and the people in kashmir
6761270 in my long career as a surgeon this is the largest number of kidney stones i have ever extracted from a patient
6761271 government may bear the burden up to 25 per cent as is being done for edible oil
6761272 we have had three indians winning the coveted medals in different disciplines we are delighted to welcome vijendra into our family of spicejetters by offering him unlimited free personal travel for life along with abhinav bindra and sushil kumar
6761273 we appeal the community residing in jammu region not to migrate from their ancestral land and coordinate with other communities and the administration in restoring peace
6761274 gujjars are integral part of the multi ethnic structure of jammu region and have stood by the majority community for centuries together besides proving its credentials in testing times therefore they should rise up to the occasion and contribute towards the integrity of the region
6761275 it seems like the pitch has got turn for the spinners
6761276 the charge of the bjp that the upa and its allies are soft on terror now witnesses a conclusive evidence with the visit of ram naresh yadav congress akbar ahmad dumpy bsp and abu azmi sp to the azamgarh village of mufti abu bashir the simi terrorist responsible for blasts in ahmedabad
6761277 the congress bsp and sp have become cheerleaders of these terrorist organisations groups and individuals who are mercilessly targeting and killing innocents across the nation
6761278 is this overt disgusting display of support to elements of terror an attempt to influence the judicial process
6761279 this sympathy with terrorists does not only mark supporting terrorism but also ascertains their collusiveness
6761280 and if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this large investment of about rs 1 500 crore and because we have made this investment we will not move they are wrong because we would go whatever the cost
6761281 i am making a very genuine statement i dont have an ulterior motive i dont have a plan that im working to
6761282 i made a major investment here to move is going to be a great cost to the company and great cost to tata motors shareholders and i think its going to be a great cost to west bengal
6761283 if there is a view that for various political reasons that we should not be here or what we are trying to do should be altered which it cannot be then well necessarily face an issue very reluctantly where we would need to move
6761284 we dont want anybody to move out but at the same time we will not bow to any kind of pressure
6761285 headline inflation continues to be a matter of concern the point to be stressed is that the inflation rate for each group is measured on an annual point to point basis hence it is largely influenced by the trend in the corresponding week of the previous year which is the base year
6761286 since we do not have the power for initiating any penal action we can only move court for its directive to the state government asking it to comply with our suggestions and recommendations on the nandigram issue
6761287 the full bench of the commission will then decide in a meeting whether we will move court and how
6761288 let the people realise the situation and think about their government
6761289 the encounter is still going on and the pattern of fire indicates that these could be foreign militants
6761290 this tatas withdrawing will create problems for the state not only in the present but also for future in attracting investment
6761291 committed to bring investment into a state which had attracted little investor attention
6761292 small car is a world story it is an issue of the countrys image
6761293 irreversibly hamper the future industrialisation of the state and could take it back to an age of industrial vacuum
6761294 back to the 1970s when the state witnessed large exodus of industry
6761295 we would have to make a move despite whatever investments had been already made in the project
6761296 we dont like this our order must be complied with we have said that in our order first let it be executed

6761304 its always just nice for people to be able to see police and firemen when theyre not on duty or on an alarm
6761305 for me the important thing wasnt about rights or the benefits
6761306 i just wanted the tribe to say yes we recognize that you are just as important as any other tribe member and we will treat you and your spouse as we treat all tribal members
6761307 it can do anything good or anything bad to the tribes and the indian people as citizen indians
6761308 for our tribe we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences
6761309 the dollar strengthened after a sharp downward correction yesterday putting some pressure on oil prices
6761310 commodities resumed their downtrend overnight following a surge in the u s dollar that basically obviated yesterdays decline and following an easing in crude oil values
6761311 yesterdays gains again prove golds role as a hedge against inflation as well as periods of economic unrest and geopolitical tension
6761312 while further short covering could boost gold in the coming sessions we would look for technical resistance to emerge around 845
6761313 we are studying a number of options and are open to all possibilities which could include buying lehman

6761324 claire i am nineteen years old whats mom gonna do ground me
6761325 she could have the guards stand watch at your door or something
6761326 for all the good the guards do we might as well replace them with empty suits of armor
6761327 i had to sneak out and borrow a horse from the stables to come get you so both our necks are on the chopping block here
6761328 i didnt ask you to put your neck anywhere did i
6761329 alright alright im sorry now if i promise we can go home would you please give me back my book i just bought it

6761334 looks like the famous prince william has graced our quiet village with his presence again
6761335 you know will we should get together sometime when youre not with your nanny that is
6761336 part of me feels bad for her having to grow up the way she did couldnt be easy being the child of an unmarried mother but something about her just doesnt set right with me thats all
6761337 it reminds me of a certain princess friend of yours
6761338 and now here you are six years later with a fish book of your own
6761339 so your father should be home in a few days
6761340 i heard they might be going to visit eric and ariel again think youll go
6761341 i havent gone for six years what makes you think id go now
6761342 i just thought with that book and all maybe you and melody would finally have something in common
6761343 like thatll ever happen besides im sure she doesnt want to talk to me any more than i want to talk to her
6761344 i take it you didnt enjoy your visit your highness
6761345 not really to be honest ill be glad to be home
6761346 as will i melody but you must admit the ball your great aunt held was at least a little bit fun wasnt it
6761347 i guess except that she kept trying to introduce me to all those lovely young men i mean honestly it was just annoying
6761348 they were nice i guess but grimsby im eighteen i dont need my great aunt throwing men at me when im ready i can find someone myself and im not looking for some stuck up prince or dukes son
6761349 and everyone thinks its your mother that you take after
6761350 by the way we should pass close to the castle of prince adam and princess belle on our way home
6761351 i thought you might like to know they are your parents friends after all or do you still resent young prince william for the ahem unfortunate incident six years ago
6761352 you dont think id hold a grudge like that for so long do you anyway i couldnt care less about will or whatever hes been doing the past six years

6761404 from a tolerability perspective ati 7505 improved patients ability to experience spontaneous bowel movements with virtually no reports of diarrhea or nausea from the patients in this trial
6761405 as gratifying as these results are particularly when coupled to the recently announced results of the thorough qt study conducted on ati 7505 aryx remains committed to focusing our primary efforts on producing the clinical trial results necessary to partner our other two phase 2 clinical candidates our oral anticoagulant agent ati 5923 and our oral anti arrhythmic agent ati 2042
6761406 while we will seek a new development partner for ati 7505 our partnering efforts will remain focused on maximizing the value of ati 5923 and ati 2042 in the meantime we will continue to analyze the results of this chronic constipation study so they may be presented to potential partners along with the rest of the substantial data supporting ati 7505

6761420 the transaction would create a diversified specialty pharmaceutical company with greater commercialization capabilities an expanded portfolio of pain management products and a strengthened pipeline which would include multiple platform technologies
6761421 our 33 00 per share all cash proposal provides alpharma stockholders with a substantial cash premium for their investment in the company we are confident that this combination would deliver significant benefits and superior value to our respective stockholders and employees and create a stronger platform to deliver innovation to patients prescribers and customers importantly it would also further diversify kings business with an additional source of steady cash flow from alpharmas animal health division a leading feed additives business in addition a combination with alpharma would deliver significant synergies
6761422 we believe our all cash proposal is too compelling to ignore in light of the fact that the alpharma board declined this proposal we think it is important for the stockholders of both companies to be aware of this exciting opportunity it remains our strong preference to work cooperatively with alpharma regarding this proposal

6761467 to begin with let us take the following motto literature is love now we can continue
6761468 i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it
6761469 style is knowing who you are what you want to say and not giving a damn

6761472 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
6761473 attack cindy she owns the homes i thought he said the wives were off limits
6761474 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
6761475 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
6761476 i call on the parliament to accelerate enacting a consumers protection law to organize the market after the recent random imports in the iraqi market
6761477 civilian society organizations and other institutions concerned must supervise the flow of imports into our market which damages the markets movement
6761478 our demand to annex kirkuk into kurdistan has not been responded yet by iraqi and kurdish governments as well as the parliament
6761479 in case the demand is rejected we will boycott all iraqi ministries
6761480 reaching accordance among kirkuks ethnicities in tandem with his quest to strike a deal among iraqs denominations

6761496 this is ridiculous if they ask you to get a russian visa if you want to travel from washington to baltimore thats what it looks like
6761497 so the russians view you as the american side even though there are no americans here
6761498 it would have been hard on me to watch bobby march to hail to the chief but i almost wish he had become president so the country could finally see a flesh and blood kennedy grappling with the daily work of the presidency and all the inevitable disappointments instead of their storybook image of great heroes who because they were dead could make anything anyone wanted happen

6761505 the inaugural mayors cup challenge match was a resounding success regardless of the final score of the match we had a fabulous experience in our sister city of dundee and a very successful trip on behalf of both alexandrias rugby team and its business community we feel that remploy frontlines support of alexandria rugby and the twinned cities programme will prove to be just as beneficial to our hometown as it is for dundee we look forward to building on what weve started over the years to come
6761506 remploy frontline is very proud to have been a part of this unique twinned city event we hope that our involvement in this programme encourages more businesses and organisations in both cities to look more closely at ways they can support the business and cultural exchanges based on remploy frontlines mission it would be great if alexandria and dundee can create more opportunities for otherwise disabled people and help further enrich their lives

6761583 many spooky edinburgh lore and gore tours retell the spurious fakelore of edinburgh
6761584 these tours are incredibly popular we run history tours as well but it is the ghost tours which are the most popular because people like to hear stories
6761585 on our tour i dont think of the poltergeist section as entertainment but as educational the mackenzie poltergeist was written about by robert louis stevenson and if its good enough for him its good enough for me
6761586 we take this very seriously all of our guides have to have a history degree
6761587 horror stories have always been fascinating to people and they have always endured which is probably why these tours are so popular
6761588 we are a tourist city and these are tourist attractions but i think some of the blood and gore used in their advertising could be toned down
6761589 the concern is that there are more and more of them and if they start drifting away from the facts just to entertain then it does become a problem
6761590 there is an actor who plays a mad monk on one tour and he leaps out at people ringing a bell every night just underneath my flat that can get quite annoying
6761591 i actually quite like the tours though ive listened to the guides before and been surprised at how much detailed history there is
6761592 i was surprised to read sir seans comments particularly since as far as i know he has never visited the attraction

6761618 as many of you might wonder what is g sharp or why the name g sharp g sharp is a musical key note in music g sharp also stands for god sharp according to our definition this means that whatever we do in our music will be intended to touch and change lives through the presence of god in it this is because without god we wont have the talents that we all posess with god all things are possible we members of g sharp laolu ola bolade bola ayomide ayo lekan ola sope have all been blessed with talents that we use and will only use to educate people and praise the god that we serve the name of the band has always been alive but made more sense when we all put our musical talents together we basically put our talents in notification and looked through our package as a band and realized that we have the potential to reach out to people with the kind of music that we create

6761698 if i tell you a story you have to promise to go right to bed what story would you like to hear
6761699 at church i heard pastor say you have a story hiding behind your smile i want the smiley story
6761700 i guess we better start from the beginning then hadnt we
6761701 well honey grandma didnt always like to smile no sir when i was a girl a little older than you my front teeth were so crooked i tried to hide my smile
6761702 why gramma when you smile it makes me feel all warm and happy inside
6761703 well there were some mean children in my class at school who used to call me ugly names whenever i smiled so i just clamped my lips shut tight and covered up my crooked teeth my mother and father were poor and couldnt afford to send me to the dentist to fix my teeth so my teeth just stayed the way they were
6761704 i should hope not i pray jesus will live in your heart little one so you are kind to others
6761705 one day the pastor came over to me and asked me why i looked like an old sour pickle all the time
6761706 he said youngun i know theres a god smile in there somewhere
6761707 but for the life of me i couldnt figure out what he meant but he dared me to find it and i was not the kind of girl whod ever back down from a dare i started looking everywhere for that god smile
6761708 that week my mother sent me over to my aunt agathas house to help her with her canning she liked to tell funny stories and sure enough she started telling me some of her best ones since i was embarrassed about my teeth i usually tried to keep my mouth clamped shut but somehow this time i just couldnt help myself i busted out laughing so hard i almost wet my pants
6761709 yep i sure did it felt so good i smiled all the way home i grinned at old gus who was sweeping the sidewalk at the butcher shop i even grinned at pop harris who was pumping gas for john mcgee who owned the grocery store
6761710 pop harris winked at me and said girl youve got such a pretty smile you ought to use it more often
6761711 honey i felt so good when pop harris said that i grinned for two days straight that sunday in church i went to the altar and told the lord i was sorry for being such a pickle faced christian and if he would help me i would never hide my smile again
6761712 thank you for your smile the light of god inside you always shines out from your smile it has always encouraged me when i was down
6761713 minnie youre always smiling its a real smile the kind that shines out of your eyes not one of those fake put on ones how can you smile even during the bad times
6761714 i got my smile from my heavenly fathers side of the family
6761715 thank you lord for helping me find my god smile

6761718 bring ing the buyers attention to the way we do business with the artists contributors
6761719 these days many people dont like to knowingly buy things like clothing from sweatshop factories because they dont support the working conditions
6761720 long term operational and marketing budgets significantly lower than what a casual observer might expect
6761721 were not playing for a high score yet in artist count or file count at this point id rather be able to provide full service for fewer people then half service for more
6761722 this will come as a shock to industry and a blow to companies that have had their applications rejected the potential economic damage is vast
6761723 these opinions make it clear it is not going to be easy for companies to have claims approved
6761724 from a scientific perspective they have done a good job but it will make many companies stop and think about whether they want to risk going into the procedure or not
6761725 this indicates efsa is applying very high standards on the reduction of disease claims
6761726 the big worry is that they might use the same standards for all article 13 claims
6761727 if every substance has to be characterised then that presents a major problem for generic claims because for most of them the substance by its very generic nature is not characterised
6761728 if the same criteria applied here for dairy products are applied to fruits and vegetables then no fruits and vegetables will be able to make health claims which is preposterous
6761729 the verdict on the ala la claim is strange in that the benefit is accepted so we feel that a scientifically substantiated statement should be accepted

6761733 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
6761734 more than 200 000 u s public school students were punished by beatings during the 2006 2007 school year
6761735 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
6761736 all corporal punishment whether or not it causes significant physical injury represents a violation of each students rights to physical integrity and human dignity it is degrading and humiliating damaging the students self esteem and making him or her feel helpless
6761737 in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population and african american girls are 2 1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected
6761738 while weve spent all this money on wars and protecting oil in brazil they spent it on infrastructure building ethanol up since the 70s
6761739 they subsidized the ethanol mills and helped them through debt now theyre all very flexible and developing the industry
6761740 with sugar cane were not going to run out of alcohol
6761741 i like him very much a lot of energy in that man
6761742 we spend less than 10 percent of our nations money on food thats lowest in the world
6761743 for us to keep doing that and getting that from our farmers they need a way to make money ethanol is it
6761744 if corn had the same kind of price support income that sugar had corn prices would be much higher than they already are
6761745 so the price support program for corn indirectly subsidizes a corn ethanol industry because its allowing corn prices to be lower than if they had a different type of program
6761746 if were going to survive farmers mills and refineries the marriage has to be from the field to the shelf
6761747 this new refinery is just to survive long enough for ethanol
6761748 we have to look at whats right economically for sugar in louisiana

6761762 we will not cut off funding for the troops absolutely not let me remove all doubt in anyones mind as long as our troops are in harms way democrats will be there to support them
6761763 this is absolute nonsense in truth the history of the conflict is not over occupation and never has been it is over the fundamental right of israel to exist
6761764 israels qualitative military edge will be empirically assessed on an ongoing basis
6761765 ensuring the security of israel and the entire world demands that we do more to convince iran to give up its nuclear ambitions and cease its support for terrorist groups

6761783 la ley de drogas que tenemos es un fracaso porque equipara al consumidor y al adicto con el traficante
6761784 cuando nos hicimos cargo de las fuerzas de seguridad vimos que las fuerzas hac an n meros agarraban a un tipo con cinco porros y lo sumaban a las estad sticas por eso decidimos marcar pol ticas para salir a la calle a buscar el abanico completo de lo que ocurre
6761785 vimos que la ley de drogas que tenemos la n mero 23 737 es un fracaso porque equipara al consumidor y al adicto con el traficante esta ley estigmatiza a cualquiera agarran a un pibe con un porro y camina toda la vida con esa mochila no labura m s la ley no sirve para combatir el narcotr fico

6761790 i must confess that on that occasion i felt some sympathy for your position
6761791 it was a situation that attracted some publicity at the time and i wondered if it was appropriate that an asbo be given for that sort of offence

6761796 this project is about promoting community safety by cutting the rates of re offending by former prisoners
6761797 sadly we know that some offenders will go on to commit crimes again and we aim to stop that by offering training and employment opportunities or by helping them if they have a problem with a tenancy or housing
6761798 this project is not focused on the most serious offenders but it will help to promote community safety in the borough
6761799 the ultimate aim of this scheme is to stop people re offending
6761800 from a police point of view local policing teams will know where ex offenders are living within their wards the start team will be able to offer support and help ultimately leading to employment and independence
6761801 keeping people out of the criminal justice system is cost effective as well as benefiting the individual and the wider community
6761802 well let you meet with him anyways but we are a little short handed during the head count
6761803 you keep telling me that i cant count on you any more
6761804 there has been an annual average of can 200 million us 187m worth of private sector investment in hydrogen r amp d demonstration and or deployment corresponding to about can 1 billion us 940m over the past five years
6761805 there is never enough investment in hydrogen but there is a reasonable flow of private capital and a lot of it is venture capital
6761806 there has been an annual average of can 200 million us 187 million worth of private sector investment in hydrogen r amp d demonstration and or deployment corresponding to about can 1 billion us 940 million over the past five years
6761807 private sector financing has leveled off but the venture money is tougher to come by because a lot of hydrogen markets are not perceived as a near term win
6761808 the market capitalization for pure play hydrogen companies primarily in fuel cells is little over us 1 billion in north america and if you add british companies it may be around us 1 5 billion
6761809 mum had me weeding and degnoming the back garden when i finished that i went for my morning run blimey its hot
6761810 theres a hole in the fence around the chicken coop that needs fixing mum doesnt know about that yet but she will if i dont take care of it soon and the chickens escape i think something got in there last night from the looks of it whatever it is was after eggs
6761811 all the hens are there but they look a bit ruffled you know what i mean
6761812 you almost done with that i could use some help
6761813 almost but i cant go out until i finish tidying the sitting room and i still have to wait for the bread
6761814 nope youd think that on a day as hot as this theyd rise and bake twice as fast as they do in winter but nothing doing
6761815 how come youre making bread anyway i thought you and mum made some on monday
6761816 we did but that was for the family harrys birthday dinners on saturday and mum wants plenty of fresh bread for the meal thisll keep for two days easily
6761817 shed bake it fresh saturday morning but she needs the kitchen for creating harrys cake and making dinner
6761818 whys she making such a big fuss over his birthday
6761819 it has everything to do with making up for all the birthday parties harry never had at the dursleys
6761820 she wants this to be the perfect celebration for him his favourite foods loads of presents an enormous cake lots of friends to help him celebrate you should see the guest list its huge mums pulling her hair out over that plus worrying that the dursleys will actually come can you believe she invited them
6761821 mum seems to think that now that the dursleys have been living amongst wizards for a month his aunt and uncle will be more accepting of us and want to celebrate harrys seventeenth birthday with him
6761822 i dont think it will happen either but there is the chance dudley will come
6761823 i heard mum talking to dedalus diggle yesterday afternoon dudleys been asking about what wizards give each other for their birthdays as if we were any different from them i really think hes serious about coming to the party
6761824 he did make that effort to help harry get well by teaching him weight lifting and harry said in his last letter that dudleys been writing to him regularly at hogwarts i dont know dudley seems to be making an effort to actually be nice to harry
6761825 so if dudleys on the guest list who else is coming
6761826 professor lupin cant come but tonks can so can mad eye moody kingsley mrs chang professors dumbledore flitwick and mcgonagall and madam pomfrey then theres neville everyone on the gryffindor quidditch team all of us seamus dean hermione and luna lavender parvati and padma were invited too but theyre not coming because the patils are in india visiting their grandmother and lavender doesnt want to come alone oh and bills bringing fleur
6761827 with that many people here there wont be any place to sit in the house
6761828 oh that reminds me ron mum asked if youd go up to the attic and find all the folding chairs and tables and bring them down for me to dust she wants the clean ones stored in the scullery
6761829 i guess id better get out there and fix the fence then see you in a bit
6761830 its really weird all morning ive been experiencing emotions that arent mine
6761831 they started out rather nice kind of like little wisps of pleasant feelings like excitement and intense joy but now now all im getting is sorrow its a little scary because i dont know whose they are
6761832 and is it true that theres some sort of bond between you two
6761833 theres not much a mother misses ginny ive known for a long time there was something wonderful about your relationship with harry why else would he go to such lengths to try to convince us that there was a forgotten fund for quidditch players at hogwarts when its really him who made sure there was gold for your recovery hmmmm
6761834 oh yes ginny your father and i figured that one out long ago but we will wait until harry chooses to tell us if he ever does in the meantime injured quidditch players at hogwarts will benefit from harrys generosity just like you did
6761835 the fact remains darling that harry is one very special young man who cares very deeply about many things including you you share something magical with him and from what ive heard its something that connects you two in ways your father and i cannot imagine
6761836 do you suppose on the day that professor dumbledore was to take harry to godrics hollow he is unconsciously opening up his feelings to you
6761837 im sorry i interrupted you hopefully knowing how harry is feeling today will help the two of you talk about his experiences
6761838 maybe it will i just hope whatever else harry sees today is happier than what hes experienced so far this morning i cant imagine what its like to be so sad on a day thats supposed to be one of your happiest what else is in godrics hollow besides his parents graves
6761839 after james and lily were buried there was talk about making the place into a shrine of some sort i never heard whether or not it was
6761840 ill find out if it has if professor dumbledore takes harry there right
6761841 the emotions might need to be very strong for him to send them to you without his knowledge but no matter what if the two of you need some time together when he gets here ill make sure youll not be bothered by your brothers
6761842 thank you for sharing this with me ginny youll be all right now
6761843 mum can i go into the village to look a gift for harry please
6761844 ill let you go into the village on one condition ginny
6761845 take ron with you its not safe to be wandering around by yourself even in the muggle world
6761846 ron would you go into ottery st catchpole with me
6761847 we could go to that sweet shop youre so crazy about when im done
6761848 well if you put it that way yes ill go with you give me ten minutes
6761849 add that to your pocket money youve both been a big help this week and i appreciate it now run along and go find something nice for harry
6761850 somethings really wrong ron harry is scared really terrified he needs help and dumbledore cant give it to him
6761851 we cant help harry i just know it hes hundreds of miles away theres no way we can get to him fast enough
6761852 that wont help i think theyre flying and theyve been ambushed in the air somehow
6761853 just let me sit here a moment i want to see if i can see anything get any clues to harrys whereabouts
6761854 harry sent me his wand so the death eaters wont get it hes defenceless now
6761855 can you stand im going to apparate us home mum will know what to do
6761856 no ron i can make it getting help for harry is more important than how im feeling right now
6761857 its harry isnt it somethings happened to him and dumbledore
6761858 what did you see did you hear anything tell me all you know its important
6761859 i think they were ambushed someplace in scotland between edinburgh and hogwarts
6761860 come inside ginny ron ive got to contact your father and hell want the whole story
6761861 dumbledore and harry have been kidnapped by death eaters they found dumbledores broken broom an old moontrimmer and his wand in the forest outside hogsmeade there is no trace of harry
6761862 it does not matter how wealthy and out of touch you are so long as you married into that wealth and it stays in your wifes name

6761865 if it helped the nation reduce oil imports that as we say was lagniappe
6761866 for years farmers had been using bagasse a fibrous pulp leftover from cane after sugar extraction to make things like paper building materials animal feed and even oilfield mud products
6761867 agrifuels plan was to use bagasse to run the refinery it would use no natural gas no petroleum agrifuels in new iberia was 20 years ahead of its time
6761868 at the end of the day we were worried if wed even get paid
6761869 i think we covered our expenses and made a few dollars
6761870 i didnt then and dont now trust louisiana government as far as i can throw them
6761871 itll have to be proven and then well be involved for sure
6761872 well have to be because our survival will be in biofuels it just depends on who can last until then

6761891 when steve mcclaren was appointed he rang me and asked me to return he also came down to training and asked if i fancied it
6761892 that meant a lot to me but i dont think i was ever that close that i would have said yes
6761893 yes it wasnt about thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just that when i was playing i was not enjoying it one little bit
6761894 we bought a bunch of food and wine where are you

6761898 it can do anything good or anything bad to the tribes and the indian people as citizen indians
6761899 for our tribe we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences
6761900 it is the greatest challenge for any statesman today to see what is the right priority
6761901 is it iran russia the price of oil terrorism it may in some ways look like the cold war again but the context today is blurred past recognition
6761902 will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic means
6761903 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor georgia and whitewash a criminal regime
6761904 the russian federation and the united states are not about to enter a new cold war even if tensions between moscow and washington rise dramatically
6761905 the cold war pitted an ideologically driven soviet union against the free world a conflict where both sides devoted enormous resources to defeat the other
6761906 an ideologically driven notion that the only possible choices these two countries have for relations are total conflict or total agreement neither of which is possible or desirable
6761907 we are stuck in relationships in which major powers are not enemies but not friends
6761908 the un isnt working the new world order and the democracy surplus never came to be but there are networks of capital and cooperation between russia china and the west that werent there before
6761909 a new context of fear rippling through its border regions
6761910 if you take one action it can boomerang and harm something else
6761911 russias strength is made possible by oil at 150 a barrel
6761912 if oil is cut to 60 a barrel russia is sunk russians spend less on research and development than poland they want bank accounts in the west to make millionaires off sales to europe they dont want a big war they want to gain influence and manipulate
6761913 as it is we need to work with china because of the role that china has played so far i think the potential of the role one of friendship and the cooperation many of the problems confronting the region are not of our making whether you are talking of the resources whether you are talking about trade climate change and economy we certainly need the cooperation and support from china
6761914 china received the largest number of athletes from around the pacific region they have received wonderful care and have been given great opportunity to compete with others and learned a great deal we hope to make use of these experiences and are confident of the athletes in their competition
6761915 this report from wisdom is reassuring that there are real benefits for some women electing to use hrt while it has been well established that quality of life measures are improved in younger symptomatic women this paper adds some information that even older women may benefit
6761916 while some of this information was reported from the whi which used the same hormonal regimen more sensitive instruments were used in wisdom which was able to show improvements in other measures such as sexual function
6761917 while this is important information and is reassuring regarding the benefits of hrt these findings in isolation are not an indication to initiate hormones in asymptomatic older women for the first time
6761918 we just heard that but no possibility to cross check so i dont know
6761919 since the riots in march reliable witnesses have established that 400 people have been killed in the lhasa area alone if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6761920 we have to recover confidence in our institutions in our state in our country
6761921 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class

6761923 if i was a president and wanted something i would claim i didnt want it congress has not given any president anything he wanted in the last 10 years be against anything and then he is sure to get it
6761924 everyone knows that rule number one for any job is showing up no private company would put up with its employees refusing to show up for work let alone watch the problem grow year after year these findings are an insult to the american taxpayer and should be of great concern to the agencies included and members of congress
6761925 it is inexcusable that federal agencies would sit by and let this problem get worse while some agencies are completely unaware that there even is a problem before agencies come hat in hand to congress asking for money to hire more employees they should fully use the ones they already have by getting the awol problem under control awol employees put a hidden tax on the american taxpayer by making the federal government more inefficient with the resources it has been given

6761938 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
6761939 if the cold war is really over what ever happened to the peace dividend
6761940 no demonstrated defensive capability and will be ineffective against a real attack by long range ballistic missiles
6761941 if we can responsibly deploy missile defenses that would protect us and our allies we should but only when the system works we need to make sure any missile defense system would be effective before deployment
6761942 i like to believe that people in the long run are going to do more to promote peace than our governments indeed i think that people want peace so much that one of these days governments had better get out of the way and let them have it
6761943 from now on when a national leader or even just a neighbor starts talking about some new weapons system which is going to cost us a mere 29 billion we should speak up

6761956 president robert mugabes plan to open parliament next week before the conclusion of talks would be a violation of the memorandum of understanding he signed with the countrys opposition
6761957 mediators would have to deal with a violation of the agreed framework for power sharing talks
6761958 if president mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament appoint a new cabinet it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the mou which means he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are

6762002 ron paul call for less government and more freedom from regulations is nothing but a updated 20 march 2008
6762003 i am writing to follow up on recent serious allegations regarding the creation of a false letter from tahir jalil habbush saddam husseins former chief of intelligence to saddam hussein
6762004 the letter which was allegedly backdated to july 1 2001 attempted to establish an operational link between al qaeda and saddam hussein in the period before the 9 11 attacks by specifically stating that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had received training in iraq
6762005 at the time of the alleged decision in 2003 to concoct the false letter the vice presidents office had been reportedly pressuring the cia to prove this connection as a justification to invade iraq
6762006 upon careful review of the allegations concerning this matter i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6762007 the law specifically provides that no covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
6762008 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
6762009 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
6762010 i asked chairman conyers to investigate these claims because if true the administration fabricated evidence and used it to lead the country into an unprovoked war
6762011 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
6762012 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
6762013 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
6762014 probably passed through five or six people george tenet probably showed it to me but then passed it probably to jim pavitt the cias deputy director of operations who then passed it down to his chief of staff who passed it to me cause thats how you know so i saw the original i got a copy of it
6762015 my absolute belief that the charges outlined in mr suskinds book regarding agency involvement in forging documents are not true
6762016 during my time as a senior officer i saw many documents from various offices of the white house regarding many topics
6762017 i was also involved in many queries from elements of the administration trying to document an and saddam government link proof of which was never found
6762018 it is important to note however in the transcript just released i make no mention of having received an order to fabricate the letter as claimed by mr suskind in his book i do speak to discussions regarding using habbush which were frequent during that period but what i was talking about was the possibility of using him to tamp down the insurgency not to influence western public opinion
6762019 the fabrication of a letter as claimed by mr suskind would have been much more than a non event
6762020 an order such as the one outlined by mr suskind would have been a huge event and in my opinion illegal an order to fabricate such a document would have been rejected out of hand and it is improbable to believe anyone would write such a request
6762021 the suskind account states that two senior cia officers robert richer and john maguire supervised the preparation of the document under direct orders coming from director george tenet not so says my source
6762022 tenet is for once telling the truth when he states that he would not have undermined himself by preparing such a document while at the same time insisting publicly that there was no connection between saddam and al qaeda
6762023 richer and maguire have both denied that they were involved with the forgery and it should also be noted that preparation of such a document to mislead the media is illegal and they could have wound up in jail
6762024 who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
6762025 the pentagon has its own false documents center primarily used to produce fake papers for delta force and other special ops officers traveling under cover as businessmen
6762026 it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
6762027 was inappropriately performing intelligence activities of developing producing and disseminating that should be performed by the intelligence community

6762029 possiamo discutere a piacimento della democrazia georgiana della libert ma il principale motivo per cui occorre andare a tbilisi ed impiegare le forze militari linteresse nazionale la georgia attraversata dagli unici oleodotti che consentono alleuropa un approvvigionamento diversificato rispetto alle rotte russe difendere lindipendenza di quel paese dunque fondamentale per tutti noi se non vogliamo dipendere da mosca che oltretutto strumentalizza gas e petrolio per ricrearsi unimmagine di grande potenza

6762033 ah ah tu ha sbagliato qvello di sinistra perch qvello di destra uscendo vede laltro pulito e pensa sar pulito anche io mentre qvello di sinistra vede altro sporco e pensa di essere sporco anche lui e si va a lavare
6762034 gi sono stato troppo affrettato nel rispondere e ovvio che andava usata una logica inversa vi prego rabbino permettetemi di rimediare al mio errore e fatemi un altro quesito
6762035 va bene giovinotto allora sempre soliti due spazacamini scende entrambe in camini sempre qvello di destra risale sporco e sempre qvello di sinistra risale pulito chi va a lavarsi
6762036 noooooo ragazzo perch qvello di sinistra gvarda sue mani vede che sono pulite ed allora capisce che non sporco al contrario qvello di destra gvarda sue mani le vede sporche e lui si va a lavare
6762037 gi rabbino sarebbe stato troppo facile lei invece tornato ad una logica di tipo lineare uhmmm ho capito ho capito mi faccia provare unultima volta la prego sono sicuro di riuscire a seguire i suoi ragionamenti stavolta
6762038 e va bene sempre spazzacamini sempre scendono in camini sempre qvello destra risale sporco sempre qvello sinistra risale pulito chi si va a lavare di loro due
6762039 oh yeah if you are real then prove it to me

6762046 ive worked with a lot of artists em and they all have a need that cannot be met by another human being
6762047 how many fucking times i chase you out of here
6762048 i have to were not changing generals in the middle of the war thats what they do over in iraq every other week theres a new damn general over there
6762049 were going to be here and were going to see this through and then well see where the chips fall but im not leaving until we have a deal
6762050 weve begun already talking about the succession process prior to this well continue along those lines that weve already been on and will identify those individuals and hopefully well come up with that one person who will be able to lead us and bring us even further than we are right now
6762051 youre talking about a man whos left behind an incredible legacy from where we started at way back in the day to where it is today with what the league is bringing in dollarwise and all the player benefits and different things gene has had a hand in hes left this organization in a very very good place
6762052 weve learned in the nfl that not everybody is the enemy
6762053 we all have to work together if we have prosperity we have to keep the peace not make war
6762054 paul and i have had discussions about how people perceive us
6762055 we have a relationship where we can just sit down and talk without even talking about business we can talk about the history of the game about what hes been through what ive been through
6762056 all of those things are why weve had success paul and i always tried to look at everything from each others perspective if we know what the common good is we know where we have to go its never been about either one of us trying to one up the other its always been about what can we do to make our product better and grow it if people dont understand that thats their problem not ours
6762057 few people in the history of the nfl have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6762058 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6762059 the position he took of creating a partnership with the owners and getting a meaningful majority of the gross revenues and then focusing on building the revenue pot to raise the boat of all the players was absolutely right it was a total win for everybody its hard to imagine there are many people who wouldve been in his position and had the foresight to think of this as an option
6762060 but i never got the chance i ended up coming here to the nflpa
6762061 but thats ok its not going to stop me from doing what i have to do but it does enter the picture from time to time they dont want to accept that i can do this job its always a little tougher

6762065 as far as were aware barnstable would be the first to pass a smoke free ocean beach ordinance
6762066 there were a number about little children playing in the beach and next thing you know they come back and have cigarette butts in their hand
6762067 there were a few comments about smoke and smelling but mainly it was the disposal
6762068 people seemed truly astonished that playing ball was prohibited but smoking within a few feet of young children or even pregnant women was permissible
6762069 id be hard pressed to say heres the literature and heres the data but when you look at the way people pack in close together on the beaches cigarette smoke carries quite a ways outdoors
6762070 your opinion assumes as fact things that are not true fails to accord appropriate consideration to the universitys legal authority to enter into lease agreements and conflicts with your prior decisions in this area

6762073 we urge all public agencies to contact the attorney generals office for advice before they enter into agreements that might implicate the public construction bidding laws
6762074 frustrating turn of events to the people who worked hard on this project but it is our current and future students that have the most to lose
6762075 given that the students many of whom already struggle to pay for their education would bear the burden of these additional costs
6762076 our decision that the evidence in this case does not support criminal charges should not be taken in any way as a sign that we did not take her or her allegations seriously
6762077 at the same time we have an ethical and professional obligation to bring cases when the evidence meets a criminal standard of proof this case does not meet that standard
6762078 now i can focus on what my job is and not deal with distractions and that is to defend jim marzilli
6762079 if i have to make sure hes arrested i will do that
6762080 we are still operating on the presumption that this young boy is alive
6762081 we do not believe he had a significant other or friend that would be helpful in this regard
6762082 there is a lot of manpower still being spent on this case we are hoping and keeping ourselves optimistic that he is alive somewhere
6762083 lying in a trial can send an innocent person to jail and can also allow a guilty one to walk free its serious in any trial but especially in a homicide case because it strikes at the heart of our ability to seek justice for the victim
6762084 a simple deviation between testimony now and testimony months later is not in and of itself perjury
6762085 the government would have to prove specific intent to deceive
6762086 its never our instinct to make a deal with someone like kyrice grady
6762087 it was just a deal we could not in good conscience make
6762088 its rather unfortunate this would be sprung on him on the last day of his sentence
6762089 its not necessarily for everybody but its not a bad investment
6762090 it does provide the consumer with some peace of mind that they wouldnt have otherwise
6762091 it just gives you that feeling of comfort in case something catastrophic does come up and bounce you in the face
6762092 its not something i think about every day wow i have it but like a lot of insurance you do things that you know you need to do
6762093 i think its for everybody at least anybody who owns any kind of property and has any money in the bank
6762094 umbrella policies used to be viewed as something needed only by the wealthy
6762095 but with changing economics and the fact we have become such a litigious society it makes sense for all homeowners to buy some umbrella coverage
6762096 if you dont have much in the way of assets theres not much reason to have it
6762097 an individual with a 200 000 home and 100 000 in investments or less probably doesnt need it
6762098 people who dont have any umbrella liability insurance should have some and people who have some probably need more
6762099 any time the economy goes into a deeper funk as its in today people are opportunistic
6762100 it just sort of made sense because of the cost
6762101 i thought that was really an inequity since i met all the other physical requirements
6762102 we have an urgent need for people to come in and give blood
6762103 we always think about engaging young people in doing service work for the community for going out to vote and things like that this is more meaningful in many ways and this will be lasting
6762104 without any question there is a crisis in police training throughout the entire commonwealth of massachusetts
6762105 and the budget cuts recommended so far are only the beginning
6762106 its safe to say there are more cuts to come
6762107 engine 3 which is only two minutes from here arrived to find smoke showing and fire on all three floors
6762108 the first company on scene reported nobody was inside and we immediately went to an exterior attack
6762109 once the fire gets into the open walls its just a race and the fire is going to win
6762110 this is a case that we see all too often across the nation unfortunately a wanton disregard for the safety of these young children by gang members who just open fire in the neighborhood
6762111 we just want to make sure that when this happens people are brought to justice and brought to justice quickly
6762112 were very satisfied a dangerous individual is off the street tonight
6762113 as dangerous as any shooting incident is in the city when people who are not involved in gangs fall victim to this action its extremely troubling
6762114 i am extremely dismayed by john kerrys continued use of our veterans as political props and im calling on him to stop
6762115 these guys deserve to be respected and not find themselves in a tug of war in a political contest
6762116 this right winger must have studied the karl rove playbook long and hard if he thinks its acceptable to insult private first class sean bannon
6762117 no senator cares more personally or has done more for veterans than john kerry jeff beatty owes our veterans an apology if he believes they dont have a right to speak their mind
6762118 everybody has interpreted the shrinking population of working age people as a mass exodus by young people out of vermont but thats really a very small part of the story
6762119 the biggest part of the story is that people just arent being born
6762120 this low birthrate is a component of a much bigger problem
6762121 employers cite adequacy of the workforce as one major concern for future success here
6762122 we have employers who have created good jobs and want to create more but they need a qualified workforce to take those jobs
6762123 the genesis of the seven or eight houses is so politically combustible that the ad cant mention it so that attack on obamas housing problem seems pretty disconnected
6762124 the negro buys what he wants and begs for what he needs
6762125 a race transformation itself through its own leaders and its sensible common people a race rises on its own wings or is held down by its own weight true leaders are never things apart from the people
6762126 show the people the light and they will find the way
6762127 god is no respector of persons in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is
6762128 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
6762129 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
6762130 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
6762131 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
6762132 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
6762133 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties
6762134 we served in a war and theyre thumbing their noses at us basically and that makes me feel really sad about this situation

6762145 most social networks allow you to communicate with friends family and potential new friends jealousbrother com allows the same interaction but encourages discussion debate and above all disagreement
6762146 aside from the comedic relief that holds true to the background of the idea serious issues will be put in front of the firing squad of users people are passionate about their views and we are hoping they will use that passion to support their arguments and possibly educate and influence others in the process

6762152 we are filled with gratitude to god for this honor for taylor university
6762153 the only appropriate response to this exciting news is praise and thanksgiving to god for the great things he has been doing at taylor
6762154 we are deeply appreciative of this external validation from a well respected publication that has been refining the collegiate survey and ranking process for well over 20 years
6762155 this accomplishment is shared by every member of our community from our students alumni faculty and staff to our parents board of trustees and friends and it again reflects that this christ centered university attracts gifted people who together strive to accomplish great things for the kingdom of god
6762156 we appreciate the recognition from u s news as it speaks to the return on investment made by students their families and the taylor faculty
6762157 there are basic benchmarks by which we can hold ourselves accountable but there are also intangible aspects of a taylor education that reinforce its true value we are collaboratively investing in more than four years and degree programs but in people who are creating change

6762234 medwedew hat versprochen jede entscheidung der b rger dieser republiken zu unterst tzen berief sich jedoch auf die un charta in der die anerkennung eines staats in einer sitzung der generalversammlung vollzogen werden muss russland sollte die abtr nnigen republiken im kaukasus nicht einseitig anerkennen medewedew k nnte sich an die uno mit der bitte wenden den status der georgischen provinzen zu pr fen was von den vereinten nationen nicht verweigert werden kann zwar wird wahrscheinlich die anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit der regionen verweigert werden doch der n chste schritt k nnte ein neues russisches innengesetz sein das die beziehungen zu abchasien regelt in diesem fall wird abchasien eine sicherheitsgarantie und wirtschaftliche unabh ngigkeit bekommen die usa k nnten zugleich an ihr eigenes gesetz hinsichtlich taiwans erinnert werden die insel ist ja ebenfalls von der weltgemeinschaft nicht anerkannt worden dennoch gelten die usa laut einem 1972 geschlossenen vertrag als schutzmacht der taiwanesen einen solchen vertrag w rde sowohl abchasien als auch s dossetien akzeptieren selbst wenn russland ihre unabh ngigkeit nicht anerkennt
6762235 f r russland w re es beraus g nstig diese republiken jetzt anzuerkennen das w re unbestreitbar der gr te au enpolitische sieg unseres landes in den letzten jahren es darf jedoch nicht vergessen werden dass die anerkennung f r die wirtschaftlichen interessen unserer politischen elite im westen ein starker schlag w re diese personen treten jetzt intensiv gegen die anerkennung auf deshalb wird sie sich jahrelang hinziehen
6762236 wenn der westen saakaschwili weiter unterst tzen wird hei t das zweifellos dass eine wiederholung des milit rischen einsatzes in s dossetien vorbereitet wird dann wird die vorbereitung einer neuen aggression uns vor die notwendigkeit von hilfs und schutzma nahmen stellen die anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit aber wird die m glichkeit geben eigene kr fte dorthin zu schicken

6762297 faz parte de mim como lisboa mesmo que eu esteja mais tempo em lisboa era um s tio onde eu passava f rias em pequeno nunca vivi l havia talvez um lado de territ rio fant stico fazia uma coisa que era proibida tentava acertar em p ssaros com uma press o de ar ali s uma coisa que aparece em a cara que mereces anterior longa de gomes de 2004
6762298 j nessa altura eu achava que devia ser o meu director de produ o joaquim de carvalho porque tinha visto coisas na cara dele na postura dele que tinham a ver com a personagem mas ele achava que eu queria abortar o filme e estava a tentar arranjar uma justifica o com ele
6762299 percebeu se que era imposs vel com o or amento que havia fazer tudo o que t nhamos previsto lembro me que na vers o final existiam mil e tal figurantes previstos fiquei um pouco deprimido durante dois dias e depois tive uma reuni o com os meus produtores que me disseram que a nica solu o era adiar o filme para o pr ximo ano e ver se conseguiam arranjar mais dinheiro ora a minha experi ncia diz me que no cinema quanto mais tempo passa n o se ganha dinheiro perde se
6762300 durante seis semanas fiz aquilo que algumas pessoas dizem que um document rio
6762301 uma esp cie de di rio de agosto ou uma rep rage filmada
6762302 n o sabia exactamente para onde que aquilo ia acho que nunca fiz nada de t o instintivo t o pouco preparado como neste filme
6762303 n o h uma esp cie de pureza do real at porque n o acredito nisso cada vez mais tenho vontade de filmar o real mesmo que s vezes o real apare a transfigurado
6762304 esse transporte de uma coisa para a outra tem a ver com o desejo que existe nas pessoas de serem outras esse movimento existe sempre na vida as pessoas querem ser actores de si mesmas querem fazer personagens que n o s o elas nesse sentido a segunda parte tamb m um document rio sobre como que aquelas pessoas fazem aquelas personagens

6762306 o miguel gostava muito que a gente improvisasse s dizia s o mais natural s tu
6762307 as minhas viagens de lisboa para aqui era a minha filha no banco de tr s a ler o gui o e a fazer as outras personagens
6762308 em que percentagens se dava a ver a personagem que vinha do argumento ou a pessoa que o estava a fazer
6762309 supostamente a representa o tem de apagar as marcas pessoais mas mesmo no cinema cl ssico o que eu gosto do john wayne e do robert mitchum tipos que eram sempre iguais ao longo dos filmes que faziam que n o engordavam 30 quilos diziam as frases deles e tinham sempre o mesmo ar e estava tudo certo
6762310 a primeira n o gostei de me ver pior que a gente ver se ao espelho
6762311 com coisas tristes n o se vive com coisas alegres vai se vivendo
6762312 se eu pedia a pessoas de l para fazerem coisas que eu estava a impor tamb m achei justo que as pr prias pessoas do cinema fizessem personagens
6762313 era um bicho grande que a gente levava para ali
6762314 uns tipos que v m de fora de lisboa ver o povo
6762315 h duas vis es predominantes do povo uma que rom ntica esquerdista que v ali uma po tica do trabalho e a vis o da televis o que a vis o do poder sobre as classes mais populares que servem como bobos da corte para as pessoas se rirem confortavelmente sentadas a ver televis o nas cidades tentei n o romantizar nada e por outro lado olh los sem sobranceria se calhar tamb m por isso que acabamos todos por fazer personagens para estarmos todos ao mesmo n vel todos empatados

6762317 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
6762318 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
6762319 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
6762320 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option
6762321 these pumps have been used in humans for other diseases and can be designed for delivery of these drugs as well
6762322 we believe they can be used to deliver drugs to block angiogenesis in complex human tumors such as glioblastomas

6762379 at the same time we are tempering our 2010 estimate slightly as sales remain very weak and near term cost reductions may pull forward what we believed to be longer term opportunities

6762417 a best deals winner may be obsolete in 2010 due to the collapsing market
6762418 despite the recent dip in gas prices significant auto rebates still exist on many larger vehicles the nissan armada beat the toyota land cruiser on the strength of a 5 000 rebate and the nissan quests 3 500 rebate makes it top in the minivan class
6762419 an interesting fact is nissan has quietly mentioned that the armada may not continue production after early 2010 that is an indication of the new reality of this market and its impact on small cars
6762420 lots of families are looking to make the switch to small cars and its noteworthy that the toyota corolla and toyota yaris two of the top smallest cars in our ranking and highly respected both carry rebates that demonstrates once again how important it is for buyers to do their homework you never know where the deals might be especially in this buyers market
6762421 the chevy silverado has been a solid presence on the best deals lists for months
6762422 however we expect to see the close outs of the 2008 dodge ram and 2008 ford f150 impact these classes as their all new 2009 models roll into the market later this year

6762432 the rest of the team are all pretty fresh and left with me very little to do which was what i wanted it was good fun tomorrow we are going to bring on our a game and take on the best
6762433 the americans have the best team obviously with the first three in the 400m and then its between us and the jamaicans although they might bring in a special guy
6762434 the russians broke their national record but we are pretty confident
6762435 your governments historic commitment to lead on global warming in europe and around the world
6762436 as proposed these conventional coal plants lack any limits on their emissions of carbon dioxide and would drastically increase the uks carbon dioxide emissions and make achievement of your stated pollution reduction goals extraordinarily difficult if not impossible building new conventional plants and setting the uk up to fail and lose its leadership mantle will make our work in the us all the more difficult
6762437 they can adapt to one to two degrees of warming but if its more than that they cant adapt they are just filled with despair
6762438 as a live planning case i cannot comment on the merits or otherwise or on the timing of any decision
6762439 the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft
6762440 for instance we have a sixth sense on the highway to know that a certain car will swerve into our lane soon based on the drivers current driving patterns then we may become more defensive in our own driving in our work we wanted to begin the process of allowing robots to use behavioral cues of humans or other robots to make the robots mission more reliable and accurate in social work environments populated by numerous people and robots these types of cues should be abundant

6762448 demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6762449 i will be making a submission to the court that this was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances
6762450 my client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice
6762451 we need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court
6762452 far far below what is acceptable in western european standards
6762453 therefore i decline to make an interim order as mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6762454 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival
6762455 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into plan a proper procedure for his protection and his well being
6762456 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason because there is the possibility that for the first time he can appear before a court of justice

6762469 instead of self serving schemes arroyo should address the present economic crisis burdening the people last we checked oil prices are still at record high levels the lines at nfa retail shops are not getting any shorter and the government is earning more windfalls via the vat at the expense of our poor countrymen
6762470 we are grateful for atienzas positive response to our demand he has not only upheld the rights of landless farmers to utilize and have access to and utilize production forest lands he also upheld the law against violators
6762471 which is in excess of the 20 hectares allowed for food production
6762472 this is a breakthrough for a group of landless but organized farmers to get a favorable decision from the denr on the cancellation of violated pasture lease agreements holders of flglas in bukidnon are very powerful and politically entrenched that many of us farmers who merely work for them are scared
6762473 the cancellation of these pasture leases signifies that the poor farmers and indigenous peoples who are deprived of land to till have hope to uplift their lives if only government is sincere in implementing laws and programmes and will not lift a finger in punishing erring forest land lease holders

6762526 at the time it wasnt good because a lot of rides had already closed up
6762527 in this sport you get tagged pretty easy obviously if you dont perform well you get pushed out and a lot of that performance is based on the team youre with
6762528 i drove an arca race for rusty and stephen and i have been friends you look at rustys stuff and its all first class you know youve got good equipment i was like yeah well do it it started out just running 15 16 races where the company was at and where were at in owners points we ended up doing more
6762529 say i wouldve stayed with the 40 i probably wouldve been out of a ride this year and nothing against their organization but this year they havent performed that well
6762530 maybe its the best thing that im over here running this a lot of guys have done it
6762531 i knew i had to run good to have a chance at another cup ride
6762532 the other thing is a lot of the guys coming in were open wheel drivers and people that havent had stock car experience it seems like every year someone comes into cup and then gets shuffled out
6762533 i was there two years and i was able to show a lot of improvement with the team i was with we just didnt have the funding they thought they could get it with dario and that didnt happen either
6762534 with rustys program i had to run good weve run really good i judge us off of the richard childress racing cars and off of the independent nationwide teams and we stack right up there with them i feel like we get better and better
6762535 rustys not the type of guy who wants to run bad
6762536 hes going to do everything he can to run good and try to win races thats what i want to surround myself is with good people
6762537 the other thing is ive talked to a lot of veteran drivers who have been around this sport awhile at the time i didnt talk to rusty about it but since driving for him hes been able to help me out a lot i just ask him questions hes mentally helped me quite a bit what ive been going through
6762538 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6762539 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6762540 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6762550 a new command i give you love one another as i have loved you so you must love one another by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another
6762551 but god is faithful and fair if we admit that we have sinned he will forgive us our sins he will forgive every wrong thing we have done he will make us pure
6762552 though you have not seen him you love him and even though you do not see him now you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy for you are receiving the goal of your faith the salvation of your souls

6762858 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali

6762872 the united states took a series of steps that emboldened georgia sending advisers to build up the georgian military including an exercise last month with more than 1 000 american troops pressing hard to bring georgia into the nato orbit championing georgias fledgling democracy along russias southern border and loudly proclaiming its support for georgias territorial integrity in the battle with russia over georgias separatist enclaves
6762873 the kremlin made abundantly clear that it would view kosovos independence without serbian consent and a un security council mandate as a precedent for the two georgian de facto independent enclaves
6762874 furthermore while president saakashvili was making obvious his ambition to reconquer abkhazia and south ossetia moscow was both publicly and privately warning that georgias use of force to re establish control of the two regions would meet a tough russian reaction including if needed air strikes against georgia proper

6762893 we dont know if it was because of georgian military incompetence or the result of an effective electronic and cyber attack by the russians
6762894 the georgian air defense system is much less networked than that of the syrians and relies on autonomous sector operations
6762895 it the missile defence system is defensive and is not aimed at anyone

6762909 the fact that the us ruled out this compromise proposal permits only one conclusion that the missile shield is directed first and foremost not against iran but against russia this is underlined by the fact that the other bases for the missile system are also located in border regions to russia for example alaska
6762910 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow is capable of launching following an american first strike
6762911 the missile system is therefore a crucial element in the attempt to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for the stationing of just ten interceptor missiles in poland but once the system is established their number could be easily increased
6762912 this article makes very clear the actual function of the missile system it is to guarantee the us the capacity to carry out nuclear war without the risk of a counter strike if this capacity can be achieved then it can be employed as a geopolitical argument in order to implement national interests

6762918 i met drummer and vocalist kevin ohlau and guitarist nate doyle in chicago
6762919 i recorded their band at the time i sort of forced them in a way into playing with me we needed something extra to add to the sound and guitarist and keyboardist david brown stepped up bassist and vocalist carly lappin and i have played music together for about five years
6762920 we are just going to keep on doing what weve done all along make music we like and are entertained with practice more and record more and sharpen our skills and hopefully some people will enjoy it

6762929 semua obat yang kita miliki saat ini adalah unsur antiretroviral arv yang menghambat beberapa tahapan dalam siklus hidup virus tersebut sehingga hanya menghambat saat virus hiv ini menggandakan diri demikian dijelaskan peneliti paul bieniasz seorang rekan professor di pusat penelitian aids aaron diamond di new york
6762930 tetapi akan selalu ada virus dalam jumlah kecil namun bermakna yang tidak menggandakan diri dalam diri orang yang terinfeksi
6762931 ini adalah virus yang cerdik dan bersembunyi adalah strategi terbaik untuk hiv
6762932 apabila virus tersebut sedang tertidur bukan hanya art tidak akan menjangkaunya tetapi sistim kekebalan tubuh juga tidak mungkin dapat membidiknya
6762933 di amfar kami ingin berpikir bahwa apabila kami belum membuktikan bahwa itu adalah tidak mungkin berarti kami belum melakukan tugas kami jika kita tidak terus mencarinya
6762934 diperkirakan bahwa satu strategi untuk melumpuhkan hiv dan menyembukan odha secara efektif adalah dengan membuat virus beristirahat ini aktif menggandakan diri
6762935 karena begitu virus itu menggandakan diri kami dapat menyerang virus tersebut dengan obat arv yang ada saat ini
6762936 apa yang kami cari di sini dasarnya adalah prinsip pembuktian bahwa kami dapat melakukan ini tanpa membawa dampak besar pada sel
6762937 maka yang tetap menjadi pertanyaan adalah apa yang membuat mereka berbeda
6762938 satu model adalah bahwa mereka memiliki sistim kekebalan tubuh yang memungkinkan mereka untuk mengendalikan virus secara sangat efektif
6762939 reseptor ini memungkinkan sel kekebalan untuk mengenal bagian yang sangat khusus dari sebuah infeksi misalnya virus
6762940 terutama karena virus tersebut sesungguhnya sangat sulit ditemukan pada para individu ini tetapi kami secara tegas mencoba menemukannya
6762941 apabila kuncinya adalah tanggapan kekebalan dan apabila kami dapat mengetahui tanggapannya seperti apa maka kami dapat mengembangkan vaksin yang terfokus pada bagian virus tersebut
6762942 pendekatan baru ini di masa yang akan datang memungkinkan kita untuk berlanjut menuju pemberantasan infeksi pada seseorang yang terinfeksi hiv
6762943 saya tidak ingin supaya siapa pun mempunyai pandangan bahwa amfar berpendapat bahwa kami hampir menemukan penyembuhan kami tentunya belum
6762944 kami perlu bekerja keras untuk mengerti apa kendalanya di samping mencari bagaimana menanggulanginya
6762945 semua ini harus dimasukkan pada konteks bahwa pengobatan arv meskipun bekerja dengan baik sekali mempunyai keterbatasan
6762946 banyak orang tidak dapat tetap patuh pada pengobatan ini untuk seumur hidup obat ini rumit dan toksisitas terus bertumpuk

6762955 government regulatory and inspectors technicians for plants lab testing the potential here for our environmental science or agriculture science students is great
6762956 when students leave the university they are automatically employed in these areas
6762957 engineers we get have come from the countries around brazil like chile and argentina
6762958 there were 46 mills then there are 11 mills now
6762959 its economies of scale but we still grow more cane than ever
6762960 the interest of students in agriculture isnt as great as it has been
6762961 but i think farming will change the production scale will be larger more people will be getting in for non food production for biofuels and production systems will change
6762962 going into biofuels and competing with petroleum products seems to be a made to order opportunity for agriculture which has been struggling because of world competition and the costs to make food biofuels is really a godsend to save agriculture and the oil price going up constantly will make biofuels competitive and gets us in the same ballgame
6762963 biomass and biorefineries of the future will produce tens of thousands of products its just as organically rich as petroleum
6762964 theres feedstock or growing that lsu agcenter is on top of and were partnering and collaborating with them

6762969 everyone in lafayette suddenly realized they were in the oil and gas industry whether they were or not
6762970 you saw a lot of property for sale signs many signs in some of the nicest neighborhoods everyone realized just how much every aspect of our community was tied to oil
6762971 our taxes from sugar cane is less than 10 percent of our total
6762972 but the multiplying effect with businesses that deal in it has a major impact
6762973 companies volunteered to move it all the trees out there were planted by boy scout groups
6762974 so to be involved in the energy business as a community is good because thats an economy that wont go away

6762999 like most syrians samer zayat has no love for israel he was a little uneasy when syria announced in late may that it was holding indirect talks on a peace settlement with its old nemesis yet mr zayat a 35 year old television cinematographer says he views a peace deal with israel as necessary and inevitable not just for political reasons but because syrias vulnerable economy needs all the help it can get prices soared here after the syrian government cut fuel subsidies in may deepening the gulf between rich and poor in this nominally socialist state it had little choice the oil reserves syria has relied on for so long are rapidly disappearing the hefty budget surpluses of a decade ago have turned into multibillion dollar deficits a country that could once afford to be serenely indifferent to western sanctions is now being forced to liberalize and open its economy
6763000 none of this has changed syrias conviction that any peace agreement must include the return of the golan heights the area captured by israel in 1967 but a profoundly uncertain economic future has created additional incentives for peace which could help lure foreign investment by ending syrias pariah status in the west a settlement with israel would lift a huge weight from our shoulders said ghimar deeb a syrian lawyer and economist who works with the united nations here it would lead to the lifting of sanctions which would give syria access to new investment high tech supplies and training opportunities he said
6763001 poverty is increasing inequality is increasing and i believe the street is frustrated mr deeb said they need peace with all our neighbors it is not clear that the syrian government sees the economic troubles as a factor in negotiations with israel although it began carrying out economic changes several years ago the progress has been slow and strategic political concerns have always been paramount for syrias president bashar al assad and his father hafez al assad who governed from 1970 until his death in 2000
6763002 prime minister ehud olmert of israel is facing accusations of corruption that could bring him down and some say the syrians may be unwilling to make the sacrifices israel would demand this month mr assad appeared at a regional political gathering in paris at the invitation of the french president nicolas sarkozy and some analysts say the syrians may now believe that they can emerge from their relative political and economic isolation without having to shake hands with the israelis this is despite the fact that the bush administration which accuses syria of supporting terrorism has recently added sanctions on the government and its business associates
6763003 some analysts say they believe that syrias economic troubles must figure in the governments calculations about regional peace the transformation they have in front of them now is enormous said andrew tabler a damascus based syria analyst and consulting editor for the magazine syria today they must move from a state funded by oil revenues to one funded by taxation and that has to play some role in their thinking it would hardly be surprising syrias oil used to be the mainstay of the governments income providing 70 percent of the countrys export earnings now it is drying up so fast that syria is expected to be a net importer of crude oil in just two years according to the international monetary fund already syria is importing oil products at record prices and paying huge subsidies to reduce the cost for its citizens that is why syria finally started cutting its ruinous subsidies over the past year causing prices to rise and resulting in a domino effect on food prices
6763004 efforts have been made to create a more business friendly environment including revised laws on intellectual property some of the new entrepreneurial activity is visible to any visitor to syria though mostly on the high end dozens of restaurants and boutique hotels have opened in the capital over the past two years in the past 18 months there has been a much faster liberalization said abdul salam haykal who leads the syrian young entrepreneurs association people are realizing that the government is not the only provider for them anymore that new activity mr haykal adds is creating a new incentive and constituency for a real result to the talks with israel i think the biggest driver for peace is all this new business development he said

6763026 but we can expect a huge amount of ethanol mill projects in the future
6763027 its very important for ethanol to be a world product
6763028 if only brazil produces this will never be people wont trust only one supplier it needs to become a commodity
6763029 instead of 10 countries producing oil we could have 120 countries producing biofuels
6763030 but this is going to produce enough ethanol only to feed the internal market because flex fuel cars are growing so much
6763031 and no one in brazil will think to build a plant without talking to dedini first

6763140 were not officially in a recession but we are in a slowdown and that depresses price growth
6763141 higher fuel costs are actually worse than a tax because when the gov ernment raises taxes to build a road it takes money from one part of the economy and puts it into another
6763142 at least consumers are getting something for their money that way
6763143 as prices go up inter nationally money flows out of the country and that depresses other parts of our economy
6763144 businesses and households have to compensate by cutting back their demands on other products
6763145 there has been immense pressure on producers not to pass on higher costs so that has restrained inflation
6763146 profit margins have decreased from a year ago because of the higher energy costs

6763215 jim was our first justice of the peace up here he presided over the first jury trial incline ever had and shaped this court into a very professional environment
6763216 in school he was at the head of his class and he managed to stay balanced when he was here by being a native nevadan he had a tremendous understanding of the issues people here face
6763217 i thought it was appropriate to name the court after james because he was such a selfless individual who made everyone comfortable in his court and someone i thought dispensed justice fairly
6763218 hes served as a mentor to many judges across northern nevada and i think they felt they could call him if they ever needed advice
6763219 i feel really pleased that this community is getting a spacier and safer court facility and am honored to have my name associated with it
6763220 back then the incline village general improvement district would have to let us use their meeting room over on southwood boulevard for traffic court because we just couldnt handle that amount of people
6763221 the whole theory of how a misdemeanor offense is punished changed as they became much more serious in the past someone who was found guilty of a misdemeanor had to pay a fine or maybe got sentenced to a little bit of jail time now there are some misdemeanors that are incredibly serious like duis and domestic abuse cases which used to be no different than most other misdemeanors
6763222 anything can happen when youre under investigation im happy that the investigation pointed out that i wasnt negligent
6763223 how are we ever going to show the public bears deserve respect when we constantly toss them aside like its nothing
6763224 based on the facts presented there is no credible evidence to believe that mr lukins was lying when he told investigating officers that the bear turned toward him to charge
6763225 mr lukins was about 28 yards from an adult bear when he fired once the direction and manner he fired was not done in a negligent manner and there were no occupied homes in danger of being struck should he have missed his shot

6763231 as evidenced by your work the private history of a campaign that failed you served for some time as a confederate irregular in the civil war how did this experience affect the writing or sentiments expressed in huckleberry finn
6763232 in two weeks we learned more about retreating than the man who invented retreating and in that little time that two weeks the desire to kill people to whom i had not been introduced had passed away so i seceded from the secession the ungetaroundable fact is i was missing in action before a shot was fired some say i was too irregular even for the irregulars no my time in the marion rangers hardened my heart against violence as a means of settling disagreements
6763233 how did your fathers and extended familys occasional ownership of slaves impact your view of the practice and is this revealed in huckleberry finn
6763234 in my schoolboy days i had no aversion to slavery no one arraigned it in my hearing the local papers said nothing against it the local pulpit taught us that god approved it that it was a holy thing and that the doubter need only look in the bible if he wished to settle his mind and the texts were read aloud to us to make the matter sure
6763235 when uncle phelps is holding jim in bondage he is preparing a sermon for his sunday services is there some irony here
6763236 its more than irony actually its socratic irony uncle silas sermon is all about acts 17 which everyone knew back then was and god hath made of one blood all nations of men in 1885 that brought a wry smile but when one attempts to foist a truth off on an unsuspecting public through satire one almost always misses ones mark
6763237 frankly im surprised that no one had any real responses to the financial questions i believe i came in today thinking id vote yes but im not sure now i think there has to be more public hearings i think they are owed to the people of this community
6763238 i think the information presented is very shallow at this point im not too sure its something that can be presented easily
6763239 i dont know if theres going to be a piece of paper or a document that will easily explain it but there is a need for more information
6763240 it was helpful but it does raise some questions and it comes down to the community needs more information
6763241 i think there needs to be more fact sheets more q an as run in the bonanza and just more additional items
6763242 the forum was good but i think another one would be better because i think a lot of details need to be explained
6763243 im deeply concerned i want to know what this will cost to increase the operations of the local government and i dont think that was answered tonight
6763244 the one big thing though is there is a lot of information that simply is not available its not provided and we dont know where to get it
6763245 i think it was helpful but we should have been able to ask more questions and there should have been more direct answers the answers were very hard to follow i want to see facts i want to see dollars and cents and im not convinced were going to get that
6763246 i think this is a very divisive issue that really will affect our sense of community between crystal bay and incline village
6763247 i suggest it will be a very large problem whether its voted in or not i urge you to do your research on this think outside the box think about both sides of the town that will be affected this is going to affect us in many aspects so know what youre voting on
6763248 it opened my eyes that i need to do more homework on this its not an easy question and i think we need to have more accurate publications on this
6763249 his efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as the fight against al qaeda and extremist groups
6763250 we will definitely try our outmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country
6763251 if they want to do something in haste they have all the right to do that we cannot force them to be with us but we are trying to reach a consensus
6763252 ultimate goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6763253 what were trying to do is to put together an agreement that protects our people that respects iraqi sovereignty that allows us to lay the kind of foundation that we need for making certain that we complete the work that weve all sacrificed so greatly to see accomplished and that work is being accomplished

6763261 in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility because the broad masses of a nation more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large scale falsehoods it would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously

6763319 as proposed these conventional coal plants lack any limits on their emissions of carbon dioxide and would drastically increase the uks carbon dioxide emissions and make achievement of your stated pollution reduction goals extraordinarily difficult if not impossible building new conventional plants and setting the uk up to fail and lose its leadership mantle will make our work in the us all the more difficult
6763320 they can adapt to one to two degrees of warming but if its more than that they cant adapt they are just filled with despair
6763321 as a live planning case i cannot comment on the merits or otherwise or on the timing of any decision
6763322 the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft
6763323 your governments historic commitment to lead on global warming in europe and around the world

6763327 the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft
6763328 this was a special treat for me i have been watching this guy pitch since i was a young thrower i am really not ashamed to say i idolize the guy
6763329 the public do seem to have switched off not necessarily from the government as a whole but they dont seem to be engaging with gordon
6763330 even when he does something that should be ostensibly popular no one is listening
6763331 that is a very dangerous position for the government to be in
6763332 theyre entering that dreadful kind of area where almost everything they say and do is automatically rejected
6763333 i am not saying theyre entirely there but they are beginning to sink without a sign of the bottom
6763334 i am not suggesting he should break down in tears on the bbc but he has to do something simply coming up with some good ideas for a speech is not going to be enough
6763335 he could make a serious leadership speech about what people should expect over the next two or three years in terms of the economy prices and their mortgage payments
6763336 he could be honest and straightforward and say things that actually resonate with ordinary peoples experience
6763337 he doesnt recognise that he has made any mistakes whatsoever hubris is the end of all political careers and he has got it in spades
6763338 he can turn it round but that is not the same thing as saying he will turn it round
6763339 if he does what needs to be done i wont say it will be easily turn round but he can do it
6763340 but it is no longer possible to say as long as we govern well we will get our just desserts
6763341 re establish labour as a party of principle and a party of ideas and not worry about alienating people who dont share them
6763342 one of the reasons that it can be turned around is that very few people are voting for the conservatives because they like what the tory party has to say
6763343 jeg har fortalt pr sidenten direkt rerne og tr neren at det er mit m l at forlade real madrid jeg fort ller sandheden jeg nsker at rejse og jeg har personligheden til at fort lle pressen at jeg ikke har noget nske om at blive i real madrid jeg vil spille i premier league n ste s son

6763350 television weather forecasters and newspaper headline writers have tried to resist the temptation to make alliterative references to tropical storm fay but theyre not trying hard enough the word fickle has definitely been overused for instance still what else to call this slow moving storm intent on rambling all over florida before leaving for points north
6763351 hillary clinton appealed in person thursday to hundreds of her staunchest south florida supporters to end grieving about her lost presidential bid and help send barack obama to the white house

6763356 last week christian publisher cameron strang said he was headed to the democratic national convention to give an invocation

6763359 thirty five states have created computer databases to track prescriptions for powerful addictive painkillers such as oxycodone and methodone the databases keep a patient from going to five different doctors in the same week complaining of pain and obtaining a prescription from each
6763360 what does it mean that overall traffic deaths are down but motorcycle fatalities are up
6763361 when jeb bush signed the repeal of floridas helmet law he called it an issue of individual freedom and personal responsibility in fact its about personal irresponsibility motorcyclists are required to carry only 10 000 of insurance so everyone else ends up subsidizing their medical care after a crash
6763362 its such a relief i was waiting for this day and finally i see the russians leaving my home town im so happy
6763363 we showed the whole world just how powerful and strong we are
6763364 poor execution terrible form and what appeared to be an extremely painful landing
6763365 you know i talked to him going into this jump and he said hed thought it through several times over explained that he had to do it and knew what he had to do to execute it
6763366 but he wasnt able to complete the back 2 5 somersault with 1 5 twists and instead just kind of flailed his arms on the way down and as for that big splash and thunk sound at the end well the judges are definitely going to dock him 8 10ths of a point for that
6763367 the screaming on the way down didnt help his score either
6763368 despite its reputation for sunny hot and muggy weather august actually is the second wettest month of the year in galveston county it turns out that the heavy rains weve seen over the past couple of weeks are not that rare for this time of year

6763370 when terrorism becomes really extensive in an area we generally no longer call it terrorism but rather war or insurgency
6763371 largely the product of sectarian violence rampant criminal activity and home grown insurgency and therefore grossly distort the global terrorism picture
6763372 it makes no sense to count civilian casualties in a war zone as deaths caused by terrorism mr zakaria wrote since the mid 1990s thousands of civilians have been killed in war zones in other countries around the world and those victims werent counted as casualties related to terrorism
6763373 obviously the war didnt fuel extremist views in muslim countries
6763374 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
6763375 the firm confirms that no complaints have been made to the firm and that no consequences have arisen for any of the firms clients as a result of the suspected breach

6763378 de goegemeente zal pas merken dat er een nieuwe bloc party is wanneer wij onze machine starten over twee maanden ligt het album in de winkels
6763379 het is natuurlijk niet de eerste keer bij radiohead pakte het uiteindelijk juist positief uit we zullen af moeten wachten of dat bij bloc party ook het geval is
6763380 ik kan onze klanten nu niet aan de plaat helpen dat is het meest vervelend ik zie dit niet als de toekomst dit is het heden
6763381 maar het vorige album is dik geflopt ik moet nog horen of dit wat is
6763382 in dit geval staan er op de fysieke plaat nummers die niet op de online release te vinden zijn daarnaast ligt er vanaf 27 oktober ook een exclusieve digipack in de winkels de band komt zeer waarschijnlijk ook naar nederland voor interviews
6763383 het is een teken van deze tijd van de vergelijkbare stunt van the charlatans heeft echt niemand wakker gelegen het unieke gaat er natuurlijk wel vanaf
6763384 you would have to take the car away and bring trucks onto the bridge
6763385 i still could not escape the feeling of underwhelment by the sheer scope of the games levels
6763386 ive been playing an abundance of halo 3 over the past week
6763387 a stunning collection retaining much of their signature musical brutality but teasing with electric hooks strategic use of silence

6763394 so i tried it on of course it didnt fit me
6763395 something like this technology could be embedded in tables and work surfaces so as soon as you put down an appropriately equipped device it would immediately begin drawing power
6763396 in the future your kitchen counters might do it youd just drop your espresso maker down on them and you would never have to plug it in
6763397 from intels position that seems like the thing to shoot for right now it could be that cellphones and p d a s are even more compelling but i think we are going to start with the laptop its easy to dial down from laptops
6763398 im now able to say that it will be a documentary about the rise and fall of tower records which was started in 1960 in my hometown of sacramento california
6763399 we started shooting some footage and interviews and well probably continue for the next year its going to be a long process
6763400 its about this really amazing company that started in sleepy sacramento california and ended up becoming the predominant music retail chain in the world and then kind of disappeared
6763401 its about the history of the company and the changes in culture in that time and the unfortunate chain of events that led to its demise
6763402 we have a wish list of musicians and well be getting into that shortly
6763403 right now were just focusing on the people who were instrumental in towers creation and expansion
6763404 a hymn to london and an extraordinary record of the city today
6763405 i do think it has settled into a different phase on the channel when you think of big brother from series one and two it was at its most pioneering
6763406 there was a frenzy around the first couple of series but you cant keep replicating that it is now settling into a different period it is our post watershed soap and that is fantastic we have got to move on from contrasting it with big brother one and two
6763407 in all likelihood it feels like it has settled into a rhythm are we likely to get 10 million viewers again that is going to be a tough call
6763408 big brother is still an incredibly important show for us it still gets twice the audience of the slot average
6763409 it has two more years on its current contract and it all depends on what happens after that as long as it continues to be as robust as it is we will have it on the channel
6763410 i feel genuinely sorry that carol is leaving the show and that terms couldnt be agreed
6763411 she has been a really big star for channel 4 and countdown and genuinely she will be sorely missed i hope we will do something else with her in the future
6763412 the advertising recession is absolutely here now and we are all feeling the pinch
6763413 we are going to have to cut our cloth accordingly this year and next it is getting tougher there is no question about it
6763414 there will have to be some savings how much will slightly depend on how things pan out
6763415 no hay ninguna zona m s segura que otra en el interior de un avi n puesto que el ndice de supervivencia tras un siniestro siempre variar seg n ste se haya producido

6763418 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point

6763421 boy every piece of garbage that comes into the market and you gotta buy it
6763422 cursed with good looks the ability to enunciate most words and access to the best parties and sociably acceptable drugs tv people really believe theyre smarter than everyone else and essential to maintaining the myth of a true democracy
6763423 but not in places where its perceived to be a potential fire hazard and not in places where its potentially in somebodys face
6763424 you do not have to approve of drugs to be offended
6763425 theyre the pinnacle of rock in terms of musicianship and performance
6763426 like a rolling stone the strange life of a tribute band
6763427 they allow fans to really interact with the band in a way they would otherwise not be able to
6763428 because youre never going to be able to talk to mick jagger
6763429 theres no band that has replaced the rolling stones the rock scene right now feels very stagnant the new kid rock song on the radio really typifies the scene right now
6763430 heartbreaker looked and sounded just like zeppelin its like zeppelin resurrected
6763431 well play for as long as we get a good response
6763432 its like the hair bands of the 80s the good ones will stay and the bad ones will go
6763433 gone fishin for marketing and sales alignment a guide to finding keeping and growing profitable customers

6763440 ill probably stay guarded on whether it starts turning things around

6763445 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings
6763446 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore
6763447 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings

6763449 when we recorded it we just tried to get the songs sounding as good as they possibly could and there are two songs wed never recorded that are on this record
6763450 we had talked about doing another record and theres another record on the table under our contract with metal blade we can do it if we want if we dont whatever but we have discussed doing another record and im kind of excited about tinkering with ideas for it that said if we did start writing a new album and it wasnt turning out like an overcast record i dont think wed put it out it really needs to have a certain vibe it cant be another metalcore record like the things that are going on these days it really needs to have that old school mentality which we had held true back then if not its not even worth it
6763451 we didnt want to change it too much and we didnt want it to sound like a different band
6763452 at the same time we didnt want to give fans the exact same record but we did want it to feel like the same band some of the stuff was recorded the way wed played the songs live because when youve played something 100 000 times you end up tweaking it changing it slightly so the new album reflects some of the older songs and how we used to play them live back then
6763453 im one of those dudes who needs to write constantly because i really suck at writing music with a deadline
6763454 my brain gets fried and i cant do anything i just shut down completely when we start on this next one well just bring our demos to practice and well listen to them judge them and start rearranging the parts that need to be rearranged or we just start jamming on what sounds cool
6763455 has at least one blast beat and very fast drumming with really slow riffs
6763456 it could be really not fun for me but thats something to consider
6763457 doctors have advised joey to stay off his leg for four to six weeks to prevent further injury or permanent and more serious damage
6763458 we know you will be hugely disappointed and so are we canceling shows is never an easy decision and we apologize to all our fans friends and family for not being there to throw down with you
6763459 seeing your friend collapse like that is something that nobody wants to experience
6763460 winds of plague as individuals have been hit very hard recently by a very selfish act committed by our longtime drummer jeff tenney
6763461 we are disgusted and very disappointed in his actions and are currently on the search for a new drummer
6763462 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings
6763463 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore
6763464 wanted you guys to hear it directly from the band that our album avenged sevenfold just won album of the year at the 2008 kerrang awards receiving such an honor in the united kingdom means so much to us because england has become like a second home this summer has been the best of our career weve seen so many of you in so many countries and youve all touched us were so proud of how much love our fans in the us have always shown us and now it means the world to us to know how many of you around the globe have been touched by our music thank you from the bottom of our hearts
6763465 it was obvious that any vehicle capable of getting across the ice wasnt capable of getting to the ice and so it would be impossible for one vehicle to make the whole journey
6763466 tidak pernah ada kasus tidak bisa kuliah gara gara biaya
6763467 this installation is my largest to date my work has always been about creativity style and proportion i am honored the trump organization has given me the venue that affords me the scope visibility and modern environment to show off my latest and largest treasured creation
6763468 a total of 16 610 samples from food suppliers have been checked with a qualification rate of 98 67 percent the not up to standard foods were detected at the farming bases or in the production lines
6763469 we have sealed or destroyed all of them the substandard food materials and the suppliers concerned were fined by doing so we have ensured that all the foods going out of the production lines to the olympic tables were 100 percent up to the standard
6763470 first of all we have made sure that all the farms and the animal farms are following strict standards and have a strict control and ban of high toxins high residue pesticide as well as animal feeds and animal drugs we are able to conduct a full process tracing of animal products
6763471 secondly in the production process we have done inspections batch by batch and had a very strict control of the exit of the food product
6763472 fashion is clearly still a thriving industry despite the economy more people are searching for the best deals and bargains online rather than traipse the high streets and clearly enjoying themselves whilst doing it
6763473 with regards to fashiorexia i and mycelebrityfashion would never advocate eating unhealthily for the sake of fashion and believe in balance
6763474 we want to reward the fans with a classic hood album and dvd that will showcase gucci mane at his best
6763475 this fall we are releasing hood classics which is full of hot singles that never made it to mainstream
6763476 born in alabama and raised in the streets of atlanta hood classics is a true reflection of the life experiences gucci mane has endured and enjoyed
6763477 i am very proud to announce the expansion of yvon lambert to london and am excited to be able to contribute to contemporary art in this wonderful city
6763478 has the exact balance of incredible history energy and contemporary relevance that yvon lambert has supported for the past 40 years we look forward to continuing our role as a platform which enables our artists to exhibit globally without geographical restriction
6763479 my mission was not to expose or target m i a i am targeting the symbols that she uses in her music and videos
6763480 if my father was part of the klu klux klan and i wanted nothing to do with it would i put guys dressed up in white sheets in my videos
6763481 we are in a period of war we are in a period of change we as human beings are facing our own self demise through our ignorance and unwillingness to find peace and global unity
6763482 metlife has been a very good company for us and has essentially allowed rgas management team to run the company in the way it sees fit
6763483 we downgraded the stock because it had really peaked out
6763484 we thought the stock got a little bit ahead of itself
6763485 i think if you look at the companys past performance and the earnings i dont think its stock is overpriced
6763486 thats why gary neville is captain and when hes not playing ryan has taken over if ryan is not available then rio stands in
6763487 in the long term rio will be captain no question about that im very comfortable with that
6763488 his qualities of leadership have improved tremendously over the last two or three years and ability wise it is there for all to see
6763489 it was always him or john terry and it was the flip of a coin
6763490 it could have gone either way i am sure it was a close call
6763491 its not a reflection other than a personal choice and john terry has been captain of chelsea for quite a while and that has to go into consideration
6763492 hugh came over to us right at the end and told us heres what were going to do on this serve
6763493 it had a great calming effect it was the correct choice
6763494 were playing for a lot of things and thats one of the things
6763495 im really trying to just compartmentalize whats been going on personally
6763496 its hard you almost have to mentally prepare to come into the gym
6763497 one of the reasons im here is because i know so many more lives are invested in this than just my own i wouldnt be here if i wasnt ready to give it everything i got and be in the right frame of mind
6763498 this is wonderful for our team for the a fantastic achievement and ill embrace it and enjoy it
6763499 but as soon as were done ive got to get to where im needed which is with my family
6763500 because lord knows theyve been having a hard time doing that
6763501 im a fairly reserved person i dont wear my heart on my sleeve
6763502 i wanted to shake the russian coachs hand because it was a helluva of match im not going to run around like a headless chicken its just not me
6763503 this team represents whats good about team sports the sum of our hearts is much greater than the individual aspects of this team
6763504 a bunch of guys playing selflessly a lot of unity and a lot of strength i dont know if that is of any interest to america but thats what theyre missing

6763507 the rupee is correcting the solid move that happened it is now coming back to reality and is expected to continue in 43 30 43 60 range
6763508 we believe that 95 percent is the minimally acceptable probability of success for a given initial withdrawal rate

6763510 classic constant 1 25 of initial real value of portfolio
6763511 classic constant 1 25 of initial real value of portfolio
6763512 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
6763513 we believe that 95 percent is the minimally acceptable probability of success for a given initial withdrawal rate
6763514 ive been on steves case for a while now after so many people told me to try and get steve harmison to come back
6763515 after ryans sidebottom injury i rang him up and asked him if he fancied it
6763516 we dont know how it will play under the lights
6763517 if we can bowl well maybe we can put them under pressure weve got two weeks left in the tour and want to make the most of it before we get home for our summer

6763522 this second part was intended to apply to federal programs such as survivor benefits social security and others
6763523 over the years and over the last year since ive been more active in the libertarian party ive talked with a number of individuals including members of outright libertarians a gay libertarian group and have come to view the second part as having been used as a club or the tail wagging the dog
6763524 it has become in effect a national definition of marriage this is not what i intended
6763525 russia has seen foreign reserves decline a sign that the market is more nervous about investing in the region since the recent conflict in georgia
6763526 they looked at me like i was coming from another planet
6763527 but i had change in my head i knew we needed some kind of a change from 2007
6763528 that song came out and everyones mouth dropped to the floor
6763529 slowly people got used to her shes got no fear
6763530 its been a challenge and a big change for some of us
6763531 for me its not my nature i kind of dont want the ball anywhere near me just because of the risk of losing it
6763532 pia is the most confident person i have ever met in my life
6763533 i think a lot of people try to cover up their insecurities but you can read right through that a lot of the time but pia is always the first person to admit her mistakes
6763534 it seemed like a bad nightmare i felt like i got run over by a bus and didnt know how to get up
6763535 they looked at me like i was coming from another planet
6763536 but i had change in my head i knew we needed some kind of a change from 2007
6763537 that song came out and everyones mouth dropped to the floor
6763538 slowly people got used to her shes got no fear
6763539 its been a challenge and a big change for some of us
6763540 for me its not my nature i kind of dont want the ball anywhere near me just because of the risk of losing it
6763541 pia is the most confident person i have ever met in my life
6763542 i think a lot of people try to cover up their insecurities but you can read right through that a lot of the time but pia is always the first person to admit her mistakes
6763543 it seemed like a bad nightmare i felt like i got run over by a bus and didnt know how to get up
6763544 the athletes from the united states have exceeded our goals already
6763545 overall we look at this as one of the great successes in u s olympic history
6763546 we had anticipated that would be the case coming in considering the resources they had placed in a very targeted manner to win the gold medal count
6763547 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
6763548 its going to be very difficult to dislodge china the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be
6763549 were not displeased at where we are in the gold medal count
6763550 well learn from this well learn from the chinese but with the resources that weve had available weve done remarkably well
6763551 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
6763552 i would say at these games we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes of the results but were not disappointed in any team or any individual athlete
6763553 the conduct of athletes all around has been what they said they were going to do to respect our hosts respect our country and do their best
6763554 nobody else in any walk of life is able to do that
6763555 the olympic movement is testimony that the world can get to know each other i think history will say these games found a a new level though the efforts of the chinese people
6763556 i think the chicago team has done very very well and the olympic family realizes the quality of their effort and the quality of their bid
6763557 its a very weak position for the u s but our two ioc members are very special
6763558 more likely to be found sipping champagne in a members bar than swigging cider in the student union slicas want the best unlike the traditional stereotypes that associate students to living on baked beans and house sharing in run down properties slicas want lifestyles usually associated with city workers stunning apartments with concierge services and central london locations
6763559 this research has highlighted that students have different aspirations and requirements so we are matching our customer expectations and adding a further choice to our existing portfolio of accommodation across the capital by providing premium student accommodation at excellent value for money although you would assume these customers come from more affluent backgrounds where paying for luxurious extras is the norm there is also a large proportion of students that just want to make the most of their student days
6763560 i have a new camera which i left in its box for many weeks i was too scared to take it out i have come to this late in life i love it thank you erik for opening my eyes

6763563 i think buffetts dollar and stock comments are a positive and thats what is moving the equity averages
6763564 buffett is widely acknowledged as a guru manages a lot of money so when somebody of that clout says something it can move markets the dollar is strengthening behind his comments
6763565 this is one of the most intensely fished freshwater areas in the world
6763566 the 2 6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catches of the north american inland fisheries sector and more than 10 times the entire inland fish catch in australia
6763567 between 1940 and 1995 fish production increased twofold but population increased threefold
6763568 we are close to a maximum level of production but the population keeps growing
6763569 population growth is the main concern although the catch is now 400 000 tonnes per year
6763570 regular complaints from great lake fishers about the difficulty of catching their desired quantities of fish
6763571 cambodia is a country where fish production is three times pig production and 20 times chicken production if it loses fisheries the agriculture sector will not be able to catch up
6763572 but the 2006 fisheries law only enables them to use small scale fishing gear the problem is that families complain they cannot survive and are using larger gear in the spawning season
6763573 education is very important one of the aims is to strengthen the community by building the capacity of the community teaching people to do their management their conservation and their planning
6763574 our raison d tre is to produce scientific information on fisheries thats the way to help national governments make informed decisions he said having this scientific information integrated in national and regional policies would be a significant step forward
6763575 i have full confidence that the meeting of the cambodian thai joint border commission jbc in early oct 2008 followed by the next meeting of the two foreign ministers will bring about a peaceful settlement to the border issues not only in preah vihear temple area but also the entire border region between cambodia and thailand
6763576 i sincerely hope that the second meeting between the head of the cambodian contemporary coordinating task force and the head of the thai regional border committee on aug 29 2008 as agreed during the second foreign ministers meeting in hua hin province of thailand on aug 18 19 will result in removal of all the remaining troops at the areas around the preah vihear temple and cessation of all military build up in other border areas
6763577 i am extremely pleased that you share my views that our two countries can resolve this issue in a peaceful and amicable manner as we continue to cherish our long lasting friendship and good neighborliness
6763578 we havent moved yet but were all scared when they come and clear us out we dont know what they will do
6763579 the problem is that this caters to a tiny powerful group
6763580 the government is attempting to develop and modernise cambodia quickly but theyve lost sight of the people theyre trying to help
6763581 this is close to the largest forced displacement of people if you count all the elections and years that it has been happening
6763582 conserved developed managed and used in a rational and sustainable manner
6763583 the lease is illegal because the lake is state public property and cannot be leased for more than 15 years or damaged or destroyed
6763584 filling boeng kake lake will have untold environmental consequences as it is the primary natural reservoir where rainwater is collected during the monsoon season
6763585 it is hard to believe city hall officials that the lake filling will not lead to flooding and other negative environmental consequences
6763586 but i dont agree with private developers using the governments name to get their way
6763587 as with any policy if you cannot fairly compensate those negatively impacted
6763588 then it goes to show that the policy is not an effective one
6763589 almost all provinces have universities but young people cannot accept their quality
6763590 the educational institutes in the provinces are not yet international standard they are low quality thats why the number of students coming from provinces to study in phnom penh is increasing
6763591 young people have the freedom to decide they dont want to study in the provinces and some universities in the provinces do not offer the majors that they want to study
6763592 most parents send their children to study at university in phnom penh even if their provinces have universities
6763593 they think that universities in phnom penh are better quality have more experienced professors and they will have a better chance of getting a job at the end of their course
6763594 the downside is that they have to spend more money than in provinces on transportation food and accommodation
6763595 the quality of the universities in phnom penh are better than in the provinces and they have more choice
6763596 and also i have a much better chance of getting a job because employers prefer qualifications from phnom penh universities
6763597 i didnt want to continue my study at a university in the provinces because there were no good professors and the curriculum wasnt so interesting
6763598 but i also moved to phnom penh as i wanted to see a new environment make new friends
6763599 also i need a job when i finish and if i apply for a job in the city with a degree from the provinces i dont think ill get picked
6763600 education in the provinces is not good so many chose to study in phnom penh

6763758 i wish my teammates could have been here with me but they were all supporting me i felt good the entire competition i had a plan and stuck to it and that made all the difference ive always known hes the most amazing event horse in the world and im happy to see him shine and let everyone know what an amazing animal he is
6763759 i still could not escape the feeling of underwhelment by the sheer scope of the games levels
6763760 ive been playing an abundance of halo 3 over the past week
6763761 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
6763762 the leader in documenting exposing and neutralizing liberal media bias
6763763 wow the blogs have gone crazy about the story i did
6763764 nothing more than an in print character assassination of rush limbaugh sean hannity and bill oreilly a foray into absurd leftist delusions of links between them and the vile murderer in a tennessee church this past july 27
6763765 this is newsday giving this woman a license to assault these fine men in print accusing them of complicity in murder newsday should immediately publish a full retraction and an abject and absolute apology to those defamed by this womans wretched words
6763766 bill oreillys people ambushed me in my driveway today with camera and microphone i guess ill be on the show tonight or tomorrow this is not what i had wanted yikes wish me luck i dont feel bad about anything i said but hell probably edit it to make me look like an idiot
6763767 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
6763768 the islamofascists are actually campaigning for the election of democrats
6763769 the best damn thing that can happen to this country
6763770 there are things in life worth fighting and dying for and one of them is making sure nancy pelosi doesnt become the speaker
6763771 tak ing our side should there be some kind of catastrophic attack
6763772 march thousands of us into the hands of the enemy they would gladly take the guns of the american military and turn them first on the american patriot rather than turning the guns of the american patriot on the enemy within
6763773 the far left in america is dominated by haters people who despise their own country
6763774 i am very proud of everything i wrote in let freedom ring
6763775 sure these guys hold some responsibility for what happened but we all hold responsibility particularly anyone who hasnt stood up and spoken out against hate speech were all contributing to the climate where people are being dehumanized because of their beliefs
6763776 the inherent worth and dignity of all people this has been part of our mission since abolitionism continuing through womens suffrage the civil rights movement and our current advocacy on behalf of gay lesbian bisexual and transgender persons

6763778 i thought we could have played better than we did
6763779 overall i thought we just played well enough to win we made a few more plays than they did
6763780 i think it was a breakthrough game for the whole offence to be honest
6763781 we havent had a big rushing game this year and it was good to have one the linemen really opened up the holes everything was working
6763782 that is one facet of our game that we need if we can tie it in with the rest of what we are trying to do it will just make us better
6763783 then we had some penalties and some missed assignments and from that point on we couldnt really rally on defence or make plays on offence
6763784 this group has great character and great work habits they will respond and come back and play well again hopefully right away
6763785 if we are all honest with each other i dont think anybody could sit here and say who is going to win it and who is going to finish in second third or fourth

6763788 peace initiatives and tibetan cultural preservation projects important to the dalai lama
6763789 we focused on raising awareness of the great firewall of china the state sponsored information filtering apparatus that monitors and controls emails and websites within china
6763790 the great firewall is a tool used by the chinese government to stifle grass roots dissent and prevent the freedoms of speech and press us corporations play a roll in aiding and abetting the implementation of the great firewall of china though the issue is complex it requires substantially more public discussion on how u s information technology is being used to deny 1 3 billion people fundamental rights
6763791 we just have to look 180 degrees and make sure that the pizza man is actually delivering a pizza that is ordered by the house and not by some kook that wrote uh you know stacy murder me

6763797 after reviewing this further and discussing it with apple support it appears the quit on launch after splash screen problem with iphone 3rd party apps is caused by a bug triggered by having too many such apps on the iphone reducing the number from 6 pages worth to a bit under 3 pages worth seems to provide a temporary fix apple is aware of the problem it is high on their priority list
6763798 something like this technology could be embedded in tables and work surfaces so as soon as you put down an appropriately equipped device it would immediately begin drawing power
6763799 in the future your kitchen counters might do it youd just drop your espresso maker down on them and you would never have to plug it in
6763800 from intels position that seems like the thing to shoot for right now it could be that cellphones and p d a s are even more compelling but i think we are going to start with the laptop its easy to dial down from laptops

6763803 we have only to consider the vaticans spearheading of the ecumenical movement the aims of which were ostensibly the promotion of worldwide unity among religions through greater cooperation and improved understanding
6763804 unlike eastern christendom the western denominations seemed oblivious to the fact that the vatican in all its long history had never willingly ceded one scrap of authority or power only now 42 years after unitatis redintegratio and with the advantage of hindsight can we see the results of this brilliantly designed and orchestrated ecumenical campaign the pope is publicly hailed as the single voice of christianity while all around his throne lie the bloodied remnants of the reformation
6763805 the letter was written before the beginning of the lambeth conference the once a decade gathering of anglican leaders that is under way in england through aug 4 the lambeth conference is facing unprecedented controversy and some bishops boycotted it altogether
6763806 the conflict within the communion has arisen over debate about the possibility of ordaining homosexual bishops and blessing homosexual marriages
6763807 as the summer months approach i wish to assure you the serious attention which the congregation gives to the prospect of corporate unity raised in that letter
6763808 as soon as the congregation is in position to respond more definitely concerning the proposals you have sent we will inform you
6763809 the anglican primate received the letter via the apostolic nuncio in australia last friday he immediately made public a note expressing his gratitude for the vatican message
6763810 i have responded expressing my gratitude on behalf of my brother bishops reaffirming our determination to achieve the unity for which jesus prayed with such intensity at the last supper no matter what the personal cost this might mean in our discipleship
6763811 this letter should encourage our entire communion and those friends who have been assisting us
6763812 it should also spur us to renewed prayer for the holy father for cardinal levada and his staff at the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and for all our clergy and people as we move to ever closer communion in christ with the holy see
6763813 it is an illusion that the second world war ended in 1945 the vatican continues to wage relentless war against the countries that defeated her concordat partners germany and italy
6763814 for that ye strove in neighbour love it shall be written fair but now ye wait at heavens gate and not in berkeley square though we called your friend from his bed this night he could not speak for you for the race is run by one and one and never by two and two

6763833 not long after we all got back together in the camp
6763834 the only similarity between the two stories is a cross in the dirt but it is hardly an unlikely coincidence that there were practicing christians in both russia and vietnam or that in the prisons of those two communist countries the only crosses to be found were etched in the dirt as easily disappeared as the christians who drew them
6763835 if the iraqi government at that time decides it is necessary to keep the american forces longer they can do so
6763836 obviamente a pergunta mais importante esta pessoa est pronta para ser presidente
6763837 a segunda quest o mais importante pelo menos de minha perspectiva esta pessoa pode me ajudar a governar

6763854 she couldnt understand why everyone is talking about that swimmer
6763855 she couldnt come up with michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer
6763856 no questions we let you in but there can be no questions promise
6763857 no questions from the floor thats the deal any questions and its over

6763859 this storm has been hanging around and hanging around and hanging around
6763860 and shes going to be around for a while longer
6763861 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6763862 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6763863 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6763864 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6763865 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6763866 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
6763867 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6763868 one of obamas biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion
6763869 i guess if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6763870 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6763871 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6763872 in terms of whos an elitist i think people have made a judgment that john mccain is not an arugula eating pointy headed professor type based on his life story
6763873 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6763874 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6763899 p lacing contractors at the mercy of an underdeveloped iraqi legal system is not a solution greater liability for pscs will also bring a higher price tag furthermore psc ranks will become deprofessionalized as many of the most experienced contractors may decide that the risks of being thrown in an iraqi prison are not worth a paycheck

6763920 thats not such a big deal since ayaka and i are like your representative in everything but to let ayumi her bestfriend to get everything ready thats like asking rika herself to get things done
6763921 i knew youd admit right awa what do you mean nothing happened last night
6763922 i dont believe you i know you yoshiko she smelled like your room

6763929 ayumi paused she didnt know how to complete the sentence actually she didnt even know what she wanted to drive at with this conversation

6763931 how come ayaka and mai said you smelled like her room
6763932 do i im not sure if i really do smell like her room but if thats really the case thats because i do sleep in her room now

6763948 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man
6763949 he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known
6763950 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6763951 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6763952 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6763953 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6763954 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6763955 everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6763956 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6763957 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6763958 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6763959 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6763960 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6763961 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6763962 you can look at that body of work that he had when he played and hes in the hall of fame
6763963 you look at the body of work since hes played and its hall of fame material too
6763964 that disclosure even on a limited basis would seriously prejudice the viability of the united kingdoms liaison relationships with highly valued partners and the importance of keeping secret information received on a confidential basis from informants and liaison intelligence agencies so as to protect the operational effectiveness of the united kingdom security and intelligence agencies
6763965 the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6763966 obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6763967 its really good news ryan is encouraged by this now it looks like he may be back for a significant part of the season
6763968 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice

6763975 im telling the truth i want to leave and i have got the character to tell the press that im not aiming to stay at real
6763976 it isnt because of money it is simply because i want to leave my personal aim is to be the best player in the world and that isnt going to be possible at real madrid
6763977 ive played three seasons at real madrid and have given everything
6763978 i think my period at real madrid has come to an end i hope the directors reach an agreement with chelsea to resolve my situation as quickly as possible
6763979 weve still got a few days left of the window
6763980 definitely he is going to stay with us the coach has said he wants him in our team
6763981 we dont see any possibility of robinho leaving real madrid
6763982 a key issue over buying robinho has always been that real are looking for a replacement
6763983 it is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions
6763984 i still believe that the decision not to vaccinate our children bodes for a dangerous future vast reductions in immunization will lead to a resurgence of deadly viruses this is as indisputable as global warming i know a lot of parents who secretly use as a justification
6763985 well enough other people are vaccinating so therefore we dont have to
6763986 its so hard to appreciate vaccines now that so few children are dying from preventable diseases today but that could all change if were not vigilant there are currently multiple measles outbreaks in the united states hopefully children do not have to die before people start to realize the cost of withholding vaccines
6763987 were done with the investigation now that weve got the coroners results
6763988 we feel that there is insufficient evidence to arrive at the conclusion that he was suicidal
6763989 if the intention of mr dirie was to commit suicide he could have done it in canada
6763990 its so green but you have all these people dying of hunger
6763991 are simply not going to sit tight while they see children dying
6763992 its an incredible feeling to be olympic champion its been a long time coming
6763993 it was a fantastic race probably the most enjoyable race i have ever had and i am really pleased not just for me but for my coach friends and family who have given me so much support
6763994 im hurting i think i might have broken my hand and im cut all over
6763995 im only 19 theres so much more to come from me as an athlete but i feel like i might not want to see my bike for a while
6763996 i just caught chaussons back wheel and went over but i put everything into this race ive fallen off and got back up ive fallen off and got back up i gave it my heart and everything but today it wasnt good enough
6763997 i looked over and the five man on their kickoff team was star running back tim hightower
6763998 we kind of came to the conclusion that your best players need to be on those units
6763999 i think after the richmond game we were close to being one of the best special teams teams in the conference
6764000 its an honor to be named but ultimately its preseason
6764001 but im excited for the season last year i did well and a lot of it goes to the team that i was on we didnt have any blocked punts going into the last couple weeks of the season
6764002 he should be a starter on every special team for us
6764003 im just trying to get on the field as much as possible
6764004 i got on the field last year after i recovered from injury and im hoping to stay that way
6764005 we have a lot of experience but we still have to go out and do it

6764007 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didnt dothan by the ones you did so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails explore dream
6764008 one of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that ones work is terribly important
6764009 you know its bad when crime scenes start to overlap each other
6764010 algunos datos han debido recuperarse la recuperaci n fue satisfactoria
6764011 insurgents engaged the soldiers from multiple points within the compound using small arms and rpg rocket propelled grenade fire
6764012 the joint forces responded with small arms fire and an air strike killing 30 militants
6764013 last night around 2 a m some people were attending a holy koran recitation in shindand district when americans started bombing tens of civilians were killed
6764014 more than 30 people have been killed i cannot say how many of them are civilians
6764015 twenty five taliban were killed including sidiq and one other commander
6764016 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
6764017 its such a victory to leave the harbor without being sabotaged
6764018 trying to breach the wall of silence surrounding gaza is the best way to show that when is a problem is hidden it doesnt exist
6764019 prefiro ter um filho viado que um filho cobrador motorista de nibus
6764020 its a radical change in terms of how they run their business
6764021 if you look at numbers its pretty straightforward amazons have jumped up in terms of pageviews in terms of stock prices theres no clear comparison here clearly they had to do something about their business model
6764022 consumers earlier had to pick ebay if they wanted to get the best price and had to pick amazon if they wanted to make quick purchase
6764023 you spend a lot of time listing stuff and then they pull it for no apparent reason or they pull it because they say youre infringing on trademarks for no apparent reason
6764024 theyre always on the side of the buyer if there was anything alternative to use sellers would use it but there is no other game in town
6764025 as years have gone by especially in the last year to 18 months theyve really implemented more layers of policy in part to protect themselves and in part to protect buyers theyve made it an increasingly more cloudy marketplace to deal in
6764026 for individual sellers its more of a hassle its helped us out a little bit because people are more fed up with the selling process so buyers come to us
6764027 we can do everything right and a buyer can leave negative feedback arbitrarily and we cant do anything about that
6764028 its cheaper if i want to have a fixed price auction but why would i want to
6764029 they have to be aware of biting hand that feeds them
6764030 at some point if a site can come along and attract that critical mass i think sellers would happily move
6764031 the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
6764032 it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
6764033 we can protect and manage that information as it flows inside and outside of an organisation so that risks are stopped before they have a chance to happen
6764034 had the data on the memory stick been encrypted its loss would have posed no risk
6764035 i take it personally as a rematch because they beat us in 2006 and hopefully we can beat them
6764036 i was thinking im going to get a base hit all the way

6764039 why not i want to play in as many olympics as i can
6764040 not too many people get this opportunity i want to take advantage of it its fun to get a chance to be around everybody get a chance to travel around the world and do stuff not many people get the chance to do
6764041 as long as i get next summer off im cool im back
6764042 i cant look that far down the line i havent had no time off from the basketball court in four years which is a good thing but it could be a bad thing i think the motivation im going to get from winning this gold medal it should carry over
6764043 if im comfortable and im feeling right and my family wants me to do that ill be there you wont know what can happen four years from now
6764044 im really focused on 08 2012 is so far away for me i havent thought about it at all its all about the now its all about the moment once we get done and complete what weve set out to do then they start planning for the next one
6764045 the majority of the guys will be the same j kidd might even be playing who knows
6764046 am i going to get an increase in pay im not making any money
6764047 over a glass of wine when this is over krzyzewski and i can talk about a lot of things but not now i have some thoughts but i want to save them until the appropriate time
6764048 we do have a lot of young guys there is a nucleus of young players who are 22 23 and 24 so there is no reason why they wouldnt come back a number of them are already saying that they want to be a part of it so for me part of the mission has already been accomplished
6764049 i was waiting for this day and finally i see the russians leaving my home town im so happy
6764050 the distribution of food and hygiene kits went well that is just one day but its a step in the right direction
6764051 steer anger among the population which can be channelled toward the government of this country
6764052 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6764053 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
6764054 news is a fascinating piece of content it changes all the time people and places are always moving
6764055 i think news is a really good piece of content to try things out with the semantic web
6764056 if a lot of people have much the same ideas at the same time then probably you going to end up with quite a good idea
6764057 people are quite interested by what they can do with the semantic web and what extras it gives them
6764058 our elementary schools that have summer day care programs they do run five days a week
6764059 i have made it very clear that if its seven oclock by gosh you gotta be there at seven until its time to go home
6764060 he anwar will win for sure because everybody knows the sodomy case is just a trick by the government and its his home ground
6764061 my guess is the majority will be slightly reduced because of dirty politics but some of my customers seem to be too idealistic and maybe they want some change in government since they are asking to bet on higher majorities
6764062 in truth and fact the expenses were personal in nature and the false treatment on the corporate tax return caused the understatement of income to defendant james smith
6764063 there is a popular myth developing that jacob zumas ascent signals a break with the more authoritarian aspects of president thabo mbekis tenure and that his presidency would usher in a new era of openness
6764064 yet zumas troubled relationship with the media militates against that as do several laws presently making their way through the parliamentary process
6764065 coupled with various other threats from zuma and his allies to the values enshrined in our constitution this package of legislation harks back to a darker past and bodes ill for democratic governance under a post mbeki administration
6764066 the bill is nothing more than an attempt by anc mps to remove the board members aligned to mbeki to ingratiate themselves with their new party president and his supporters and to pave the way for further
6764067 by supporting this bill anc mps have shown themselves to be just as spineless as when they first agreed to accept mbekis hand picked candidates
6764068 if politicians use organs of state to entrench their own power the inevitable result is a descent into authoritarian rule
6764069 this is typified by zimbabwean president robert mugabe who has manipulated the electoral commission the state broadcaster and the security forces to cling to power
6764070 yet again zumas anc is demonstrating that it poses a serious threat to constitutional freedoms by passing laws confirming their leaders stated belief that the anc is more important than the constitution
6764071 the rain makes it better we felt like warriors out there
6764072 you train your whole life and you want to win you dont expect to lose
6764073 we have new coaches and new guys all over ive been working hard to get better so in a lot of ways i feel like a new player
6764074 every day i go out and i practice like im trying to be the no 1 receiver
6764075 ted has been working on his route running and its all coming together
6764076 weve just got to be patient people got to understand it takes time
6764077 ted is still a big kid but its definitely great to have somebody whos actually been there and experienced
6764078 everybody hasnt had too much experience so the experience we do get we share with each other and we try to learn from mistakes and get better as a unit he had a great game and its definitely something we have to feed off of and get motivated by
6764079 no matter who the quarterback is i think i can do that if i just keep working
6764080 the big barrier to entry is how much time and money it can cost to create effective video ads
6764081 big companies have marketing staffs and ad agencies and big budgets so our mission when we got into this business was to bring a complete ad service to the smaller guys so they dont get left out
6764082 creating your ad is free so you can make two or 20 its up to you
6764083 for some local businesses its important to geo target and pick a particular state city or county for instance
6764084 we use contextual targeting so you could also define an age group or say youre interested in people who are interested in travel once thats specified our technology takes that information and serves your ad on our network which has over 40 million unique visitors we match your ad with an audience by using keywords tags and behavior profiles then we track how they do with real time reports
6764085 this feature is especially useful for small businesses who are more interested in closing the sale than building their brand they can create a coupon as a pdf or word file and when the ad is displaying theres a little bar at the bottom that will say click here for a special offer type thing and the viewer can print out the coupon or if its an online coupon get the coupon code
6764086 if you decide to run a campaign for five weeks but after the first week you want to pause it and change the ad you can because theres no charge for creating a new ad then you can continue and say launch three different ads to see which one does best and continue tweaking it
6764087 this is critical for small businesses who cant afford to pay 5 000 for a campaign just to find out it isnt working with jivox they can incrementally test the campaign and adjust it as they go
6764088 aku dijanjikan bidadari bidadari ayu dan selalu perawan di surga nanti
6764089 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6764090 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6764091 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6764092 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6764093 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
6764094 the august bank holiday is our traditional goodbye to the summer and is always very busy
6764095 this year is no exception with large numbers escaping to guaranteed sunshine sandy beaches and warm seas
6764096 there will still be no escaping the localised congestion around big attractions such as theme parks and events
6764097 the festivals around the uk will be some of the spots that lead to delays
6764098 im not christian by any stretch of the imagination but i reckon one of the downsides of the dechristianization of most of the modern world is that people seem to have thrown away the concept of a soul along with all the rest of the old claptrap forgetting that some metaphors are just that and useful in living a life and cultivating a mind that isnt hipdeep in the muck
6764099 i was lucky enough to have met maradona before the olympics
6764100 i spoke to him about napoli and the city of naples and it was great to hear his opinions
6764101 everyone would like to play in every game but it doesnt bother me if i dont start
6764102 even if i dont feature in the final i will feel like a champion if we beat nigeria
6764103 we have so many great players in the squad but i will quietly wait for my chance and make a contribution if it comes
6764104 the moment of my life when the dowsing rod suddenly went down hard as far as i was concerned i was on my way
6764105 i need you your country needs you give me four years
6764106 the only statement i want to make is that i am an innocent man convicted of a crime i did not commit i have been persecuted for 12 years for something i did not do from gods dust i came and to dust i will return so the earth shall become my throne i gotta go road dog i love you gabby
6764107 do you know what you want out of life how do you know how did you figure it out
6764108 very much so if youre a player you want to play some players think this loan thing is the end of the world but david beckham once went on loan to preston and jonny evans came on loan here and did his career the world of good he was on the bench for manchester united the other day
6764109 you dont have to be 18 or 19 to go on loan but its a different animal were dealing with these days
6764110 in an ideal world we need to move one or two on permanently and try to get some money back into the club and get players off the wage bill
6764111 the chief executive the chairman and owners of the club have constantly asked that and its one thing getting players in but you cant keep bringing players in on top of the players weve got we have a lot of professionals at the club
6764112 but some of the professionals have no intention of moving anywhere and they will be here until their contracts expire one or two of them are going nowhere unless real madrid come in for them
6764113 one or two players would certainly be out of your plans but i can guarantee they are going to see their contracts out
6764114 some players dont love the game they just sit through their contracts every club will have two or three of them and were no different we have two or three who have absolutely no intention of going anywhere
6764115 the fans and the city have created a positive environment
6764116 with cesare prandelli the club is getting great results while playing an organised enjoyable and workmanlike game
6764117 they could be the great surprise as long as the champions league doesnt demand too much from them
6764118 nikon software is designed for windows and mac os opersting sic systems only nikon do not have any plans at present to support linux unix or any other operating system
6764119 not a drop in replacement for windows or macos for photography yet far from it you can use linux for serious photography but critical pieces are still missing or are too kludgy for efficient work you need to be willing to accept sacrifices

6764162 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6764163 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6764247 this king loves jews therefore he asked the jews living in bahrain to request jews living in israel to return there are two reasons for it one is lip service or to emphasize his love to the jews there
6764248 i want to tell you there are very few jews in bahrain they all work as traders they are obligated to the king and in the parliament this wise king chose from every group representatives in the parliament even the jews who are a small minority
6764249 the jews felt hostility they were victims of looting including my house in bahrain the majority are shia muslims which were behind most of the looting that s when i decided to come to israel
6764250 they refused they have a lot of money businesses i gave up
6764251 but i think that the people of the parliament dont like the idea that a jew is there and see her as a spy the king who loves the jews promoted her to be an ambassador

6764283 last year around 12 million pensioners in more than 8 5 million households received payments from the government
6764284 we dont want anyone to miss out on the help they are entitled to if you havent received a winter fuel payment before you need to apply by september 19 to receive your payment before christmas

6764327 were getting better at recycling in west sussex in four years the recycling rate has rocketed from 22 per cent to 36 per cent which is above the national average
6764328 its the first of its type in the west sussex and certainly one of the most advanced in the country even boasting an education room and a public viewing platform
6764329 but it can be turned into a resource such as compost gas or electricity a contract will be signed to build a waste treatment facility to do just that
6764330 however so far no decisions been made about what sort of facility that will be or where it will be located
6764331 but it will be the best and safest type available with the latest technology to protect the environment it will meet the waste demands of west sussex for many years to come
6764332 all eyes are on the target of recycling 45 per cent of household waste by 2015 a target theyre confident of not only reaching but actually topping
6764333 waste side story highlights the challenges ahead and the steps we are taking to tackle the mountain of rubbish in west sussex
6764334 our battery regulations add to the measures that this government has put in place to reduce the impact of waste products on the environment
6764335 they represent a big first step towards implementing the batteries directive as a whole and provide positive contribution to the workings of the internal market and provide a foundation for reducing the environmental impact of the many millions of portable industrial and automotive batteries used in the uk each year
6764336 i want to see how much we can do with our first unit throwing the ball so it will be a good test for us
6764337 it was better early on it was a little bit shaky again but not as many plays today either well see ive got a positive outlook on this week and i think theyre going to perform really well
6764338 javon hasnt had a very good week its going to be a big game for him
6764339 its preseason but its the most important game the game being the third hell play a lot and hopefully well get him the ball a number of times and hell make some plays for us
6764340 were going to go old school buddy ryan as they call it around here and well come after him every snap and put a bounty in the locker room on him
6764341 we are very proud our program is recognized as one of the top 50 in the u s and top 25 for publics
6764342 our enhanced programming in international business supply chain and innovation and entrepreneurship is continuing to differentiate our programs our reputation as a college is definitely catching up with the quality of our offering
6764343 while we are disappointed about being ranked lower than last year in u s news and world report our overall momentum and progress toward key goals remains quite strong we are recruiting the best and brightest students in our history and retaining and attracting some of the nations most talented faculty
6764344 many of our efforts have had a dramatic and immediate impact on our students but they are comprehensive strategies that may not change the overall numbers that u s news evaluates for several years
6764345 our main priority and responsibility is to make investments to ensure that our students receive the very best education and support along with the experiences to prepare them for competing in a global society
6764346 we have made strides in alumni giving as a direct reflection of the campaign for tennessee
6764347 the enthusiastic support of committed alumni and their ability to engage others is a key factor in moving the institution forward particularly to begin and advance our key initiatives
6764348 our challenge is to take the scholarship and make it enjoyable to a readership that enjoys history
6764349 i would say generally speaking that scholars would have no interest at all
6764350 what it ends up being is something that laypersons find helpful or would think it would be helpful any biblical studies expert worth their salt would not have much interest in this at all except as kind of a curiosity
6764351 it was very common in antiquity to attribute ones own writings to the most important historians in the past
6764352 it happens not just in the bible socrates certainly didnt say everything plato quotes him as saying
6764353 its like you would attach a pack of cigarettes with a warning label from the surgeon general
6764354 well this bible should have a warning from the theologian general or something this bible may be harmful to your spiritual health
6764355 the bible can be intimidating for people and the chronology can help people put the timeline together in their minds
6764356 we try to put our bible studies now in context of when things occur
6764357 it would give people i think a greater sense of how things were laid out in that way

6764366 it was a business decision that made good financial sense based on the federal and state tax credits available as well as the collaboration with progress energy and appalachian energy
6764367 it will take us less than five years to recoup our investment
6764368 this deal is another example of how business leaders are turning to solar power to boost their revenues
6764369 jim barkley toyota progress energy and appalachian energy were able to come up with something that was mutually beneficial in part because north carolina has a renewable energy portfolio standard
6764370 combined with federal tax credits reps gives companies the opportunity to break even on their investment in solar much more quickly than would otherwise be possible
6764371 progress energy is moving forward aggressively in pursuing renewable energy as part of a balanced strategy for meeting the regions growing energy needs reliably affordably and in an environmentally responsible fashion
6764372 were pursuing technology partnerships and other agreements to expand the use of renewable energy in north carolina innovative projects such as this one will be critical in meeting our states objectives for renewable energy in the future
6764373 we were impressed with lawsons scalability and the applications abilities to more easily integrate with our ge idx practice management system
6764374 lawsons strong reputation in the healthcare industry especially among academic medical centers was a key factor in our decision to make this long term investment
6764375 healthcare providers need simplified standardized business processes to help manage soaring labor and supply costs
6764376 our proven applications offer built in industry best practices and the operational business intelligence healthcare organizations need to help them continue to deliver high quality care as patient volumes grow
6764377 this years edition has been compiled through briefings with vendors themselves along with conversations with analysts users and system integrators our mission selecting this years products has been deceptively simple select those that deliver robust customer value
6764378 clustifys proprietary algorithm makes it uniquely able to produce high quality clusters while scaling up to very large document sets
6764379 rigorous analysis of data is the foundation for any meaningful changes to the quality and cost of health care david will add tremendous value and strategic oversight to aetnas health informatics capabilities as we further demonstrate the value of our clinical improvement and cost containment programs for our members

6764394 we help local governments simplify administration and reduce operational costs so they can continue to focus more resources on their public service missions

6764407 but we need a wider engagement of all sector ministries civil society and indeed a complete national constituency to deal effectively with the effects of climate change
6764408 africa needs a voice in international protocols on climate change and african leaders need to demonstrate a clear understanding of what africas stake is
6764409 african countries would only be expected to come up with voluntary actions geared towards addressing the problem of climate change because africas contribution to the problem is highly insignificant

6764422 we took a long hard look at the finishes we had offered for years and asked how can we improve them in terms of the environment and ease of use without sacrificing our beautiful hand rubbed look
6764423 the drawbacks with many urethane products have always been the vocs they release the fact that they can wind up looking painted on and the difficulty they pose when touch ups are required our new finishes overcome these issues especially in terms of the gorgeous final results which meet or exceed that of our previous products in terms of really enhancing the natural beauty of the wood itself
6764424 with these finishes you get great touch up results plus after many years of wear you can refresh the whole floor with a simple recoating and it will look terrific
6764425 now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law so that every mouth may be stopped and the whole world may be held accountable to god for by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight since through the law comes knowledge of sin
6764426 so the law is holy and the commandment is holy and righteous and good
6764427 when god gives orders and tells us what will happen if we fail to obey those orders perfectly that is in the category of what the reformers following the biblical text called law
6764428 the law orders that we after attempting to do what is ordered and so feeling our weakness under the law may learn to implore the help of grace
6764429 by means of its fearful denunciations and the consequent dread of punishment to curb those who unless forced have no regard for rectitude and justice

6764441 the pnc finds the present provision of article 88 of the 1992 constitution which makes the attorney general a g both a minister of state as well as the one responsible for the initiation and conduct of all prosecutions of criminal offences unacceptable
6764442 this defeats the fight against corruption since the a g cannot effectively prosecute colleague ministers of state and various government functionaries a pnc government will seek to amend this constitutional provision so as to clearly separate the minister of justice and his functions from those of the attorney general
6764443 this independent identity that the pnc is seeking will enable the ag to pursue and bring to book every one including ministers who commit economic and other crimes against the state
6764444 today public officials and their relatives acquire properties far in excess of their known income key sections of the bureaucracy such as ceps the police and the judiciary have repeatedly been shown in surveys to be mired in corruption this further underrmines governance and impedes development
6764445 will implement a broad legislative agenda including the separation of the minister of justice from the office of the attorney general to improve governance and fight corruption
6764446 it is time ghanas parliament insisted on the separation of the two offices and disallow the president from merging the two again it is not good for the effective governance of our country
6764447 with respect to the judiciary notwithstanding its independence it draws its monies from the consolidated fund so that implies the government interest of a sort the expansion of the judiciary and provision of court buildings and facilities must be the responsibility of the minister for justice not the chief justice

6764475 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users as reported by an official chinese media outlet reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public

6764480 what we are facing is a numbers shortage there is no way we will be able to survive at our current level if it continues like this
6764481 it will be impossible to have any improvement this season if we do not improve the numbers greatly
6764482 now we are more players short than then so if we are in a worse position there is no way we can achieve again what we did last season we are trying to make it better and working hard on the current situation
6764483 this is probably the toughest period i have had as everton manager mainly because a lot of my concentration at the moment is not with the players i have here and they are the most important but with trying to bring new players in
6764484 there is no doubt that a lot of our energy is being spent on players we want to sign and that is not helpful for the team

6764496 but 2004 is the ancient regime compared to this year the blackberry existed then but its gone through about three generations of new technology since four years ago it was the new new thing now everyone in the media has one and everyone is getting these e mails
6764497 in an election of this magnitude it is imperative that journalists across the country are provided with the information about barack obamas thin record that is necessary to report the news in a balanced way
6764498 sometimes it takes a lot of e mails phone calls and knocks on the door to ensure readers are informed of barack obamas inexperience and lack of energy solutions john mccain and republicans across the country are committed to ensuring that everyone has access to our side of the story
6764499 pennsylvania families dont want another four years of failed bush policies and we will continue to draw attention to that fact

6764542 the impact of global warming is brutal and tragic for polar bears
6764543 the only way to limit the number of bears that will drown and starve is to reduce greenhouse gas pollution immediately
6764544 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
6764545 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6764546 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6764547 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6764548 our impression is that this is one of the increasing risk factors that bears are facing as the sea ice habitat where they need to forage is disappearing and such risks were considered in the recent projections we made regarding future welfare of polar bears
6764549 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals their home is on the surface of the ice
6764550 to find so many animals at sea in a single survey on a single day is extremely significant

6764559 obama has the best ideas and will really bring us together as a nation
6764560 from our point of view it went well because we had a good informed discussion

6764587 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6764588 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6764589 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws

6764618 someone brain washed them as in a person you no brainwashed them
6764619 yes someone who ever it is probablly has a grudge and thinks everyone deserves to die

6764651 isnt that a little too long for a christmas vacation rouge

6764656 i dont want to get personal here but i never pictured myself getting pregnant i mean i never thought that it was possible
6764657 sonic there is nothing wrong with being pregnant its a fact of life i never pictured myself being a doctor
6764658 well i didnt like the idea of being a doctor instead i wanted to be a teacher
6764659 yes sonic i wanted to be a teacher because i loved caring for little children
6764660 i hated the sight of blood i couldnt stand seeing blood i always felt sick whenever i saw blood
6764661 but if you never liked the sight of blood why are you a doctor now
6764662 i never liked blood until the day my younger sister cut her leg while climbing a tree at first i panicked and felt like i was going to throwup but then my instincts took control i quickly washed off the cut with my water bottle then i took out some cloth i always carried around with me and used it to bandage up her cut after it was bandaged i realized what i just did i had conquered my fear over blood and when i got older i attended medical school got my degree in health then i got my doctors degree and became a doctor

6764685 it should be in every rucksack for those times when soldiers need spiritual energy
6764686 he tells me that his trial in vietnam was a travesty of justice
6764687 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offenses he was convicted of in vietnam
6764688 this is nothing less than a co ordinated smear campaign
6764689 i honestly dont know why else she would do this
6764690 i am a decent straight talking individual and would never have said those words
6764691 i swear on my childrens lives i never called her a dyke
6764692 if anyone is anti gay it is sue connelly she was against the repeal of section 28
6764693 as it happens a fair few friends of the family are of the homosexual persuasion
6764694 all mrs smith said was alright liam thats 4 0
6764695 she was only making a joke to him it was unnecessary and irrelevant
6764696 that word should not be used as an insult and he is setting a bad example to his constituents
6764697 dakine is well established within the boardsports sector and it is a brand that has built its reputation on the quality and reliability of its technical range
6764698 it has built a strong sales base in north america and a growing sales base in several international territories making it a powerful addition to the group
6764699 dakine is a brand that leads the boardsports backpack category excels in the surf accessories market in the ultimate testing ground of hawaii and has excellent penetration in winter product categories including snow gloves
6764700 it is a brand that is focused on function over fashion and this together with a strong team of athletes and compelling marketing campaigns has endeared it to active boardsports participants
6764701 billabong and dakine have both determined that each of us has complementary skills and strengths and together we have a compelling authentic offer
6764702 i think martina would agree that the most gratifying and most humbling thing is when women that have really lived this come up to you with tears in their eyes and say you got the story right
6764703 considering we tried to sell bejeweled outright to more than one industry giant back in the early days of our company and got no takers even after reducing our asking price to 60 000 this little game has done all right for itself
6764704 i vividly recall prospective buyers telling us its not even a game while showing us the door

6764708 now that the conflict with south ossetia is exhausted there are nato vessels in the black sea what for and with what aim
6764709 this is a relatively new statement for me i think all issues including similar provocations have been discussed under bilateral agreements between russia and ukraine on the status of the black sea fleet we will give a prompt response if anything happens
6764710 passengers who were booked on the affected flight last night will now travel on a flight this evening which will depart at 23 10 local time
6764711 passengers who chose not to fly anymore are entitled to a refund
6764712 we are deeply disappointed and when a decision was to be made on sunday we think south africa made a hasty choice
6764713 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6764714 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6764715 i dont think were going to have anything quite as out there as diablo iis arcane sanctuary id say the scale and scope of the game in terms of the threat you end up facing is much much higher than the previous games i think if you look at the cinematic trailer theres never really been an invasion of sanctuary and i think from the trailer its obvious thats where were headed a lot of what happened in the original diablo was very small in scope even in diablo ii you traveled all over the world like youre really just facing the aftermath of diablo walking through the world there was a bit of it with lord of destruction baals invasion was sizable but we really want to go more higher than that thats about as detailed as i can be without giving away key story elements
6764716 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 efficiency over several feet
6764717 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6764718 for me its like a confirmation that its so exciting its something people would like to have
6764719 now the question is if its feasible or not its exciting that theyre also inspired and it seems closer to reality every day
6764720 it was something that i could get my teeth into and it definitely appealed to me
6764721 the last time i had gone to shrewsbury they were in the old stadium at gay meadow and that was not an attractive proposition
6764722 but the club is ambitious and wants to get out of league two at a time when some clubs seem happy to survive in the division
6764723 i have no idea at all it is impossible to put a figure on it
6764724 there is a pressure and stress but i know for a fact that every single time we play at home there are five and a half thousand people who would like to swap with me
6764725 the week after a win whether director player manager or supporter is so much more enjoyable we are fortunate in that we can influence so many peoples lives and make them better
6764726 it is the football team that determines what level you play at
6764727 there is a hell of a long way to go
6764728 it was more out of respect and courtesy than anything else that saw paul simpson driving down to shrewsbury earlier this year he had been invited down for an interview for the position of manager and being a decent sort
6764729 wembley english football suffered an uncomfortable night as a muddled display from fabio capellos side was played out against the backdrop of high level political intrigue in soho square capellos england had barely embarked on what was a hugely worrying performance

6764733 you always do things i never have the guts to try
6764734 look im going to offer you 40 for this pile of clothes right now
6764735 i know youre going out of business next week and ive seen the massive amount of clothes you still have so theres no way you are going to sell this all before then this is a deal for you guys
6764736 um were closing because they are redeveloping this shopping center were just going to send our leftover stuff to the other steve amp barrys
6764737 sorry about that confusion its shopping tradition to barter when a store is going out of business
6764738 oh yeah i do it all the time i usually get things for 90 95 percent off
6764739 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
6764740 we have attempted to hold off on further price changes this year and only took this action after very careful consideration on the impact to our valued customers based on current market pressures
6764741 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6764742 president obama is going to have plenty on his plate in january
6764743 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6764744 i dont agree with many of the conclusions in the movie
6764745 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6764746 youre just going to have to hear from the campaign and theyll make the announcement when theyre ready
6764747 my mom in kansas city loves it when someone will talk about me as vp
6764748 and if hes going to say one people one nation he can raise the banner of unity with her as his vice presidential running mate
6764749 the information i have is that if theyre leaving it is at a snails pace
6764750 expects russia to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces
6764751 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6764752 no way shes cool cause shes tied up under that shade tree
6764753 no you dont understand your dog needs to be bred
6764754 that dog dont need no bread she aint hungry cause i fed her this mornin
6764755 no you dont understand your dog wants to have sex
6764756 our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six point agreement and theres no territorial integrity in the six principles
6764757 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6764758 what we see on the ground is the result of ambiguity
6764759 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important
6764760 theres no way that russian positions can be considered in line with the resolution
6764761 ive got a gesture for all you whining pimple heads
6764762 i agree that it would take more than a gesture
6764763 would one gesture be enough for the fans to forgive the royal fucking they
6764764 what bothers me about all this is that it doesnt seem smart gail could
6764765 sure lets say the market goes down another 40 so what
6764766 my name will be great among the nations from the rising to the setting of the sun in every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to my name because my name will be great among the nations
6764767 typically what we want to see is a hose running nice and slowly saturating that root zone and then letting it dry out before you water again youre not going to water in this type of condition though so definitely take care of those trees get them plenty of water at least once a week
6764768 its really unnerving that we end up with these fire traps
6764769 if nothing else we have a bully pulpit here to spur dialogue at the state level
6764770 thats the good news the bad news is it wasnt adequate clearly this is a wakeup call that government has to go to greater lengths to keep people safer in their buildings
6764771 i think we all have to examine the codes and consider upgrades
6764772 there are two grave issues one is the safety of the residents and the other is the safety of the emergency responders
6764773 blazing inferno spreading from one end of the roof to the other
6764774 involving a bunch of people without agility we have tens of thousands of people living under roofs with no sprinklers no fire walls
6764775 i would think that if you are going to tolerate these wooden trusses you should certainly have hand in hand a requirement for sprinklers in these common areas
6764776 so i guess in the end things really worked out
6764777 i hope for many years as good as this one
6764778 do i think that the idea to promote regional cooperation in the region is a good one and that turkey has a role to play here
6764779 the answer is yes but this particular proposal is not the way to approach it in a general sense i would agree that turkey has a role to play and needs to be more active

6764788 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from
6764789 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off
6764790 i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6764791 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it
6764792 we go back and forth i dont know if its our immediate future its something we talk about every few months
6764793 if they would be as pretty as brad and angelinas kids we might
6764794 its something we would never take lightly and just say that would be fun its a lot of work and we recognize that
6764795 in a way we want to be selfish because we love our life but we know how much that adds to it
6764796 im all right im just fine and youre a tool
6764797 its very sarcastic and sick humor and its also a screw you anthem with so much love attached its like when a kindergardener goes up and punches a girl he likes and runs away care bears my darling its all good
6764798 its what i do im healing myself with other songs ive been having a lot of fun
6764799 winona didnt waste any time she and tom were all over each other laughing and carrying on

6764806 i believe we are an aggregate of tiny bits who we are and where weve been or who we want or pretend to be the tesserae the tiles i create from junk mail represent those bits in color and texture and meaning
6764807 came up with the idea to get people talking about the volume of junk mail delivered in her neighbourhood
6764808 i only shred the non glossy stuff and try to avoid colored ink as much as possible since im shredding to avoid identity theft in the first place and credit applications these days contain colored ink i cant stay 100 black and white but i can accept that
6764809 i shred plastic items like credit cards and cds separately and discard
6764810 i only use the shreds where food is not grown just to be safe you can also use it in the bottom of flower pots inside the house to save potting soil
6764811 these luxurious waterfront urban apartment homes rest in baltimores oldest neighborhood bristling with standard amenities like expansive ceilings sleek hardwood floors gourmet kitchens with granite throughout and stainless appliances the crescent at fells point is the newest jewel in the neighborhood an incomparable place to call home

6764814 they hit the gun you know the backside of the gun
6764815 i just work inside behind the corner two guys came and he two timed me into my head
6764816 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6764817 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6764818 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6764819 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6764820 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6764821 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6764822 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6764823 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6764824 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6764825 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6764826 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6764827 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6764828 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6764829 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6764830 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6764831 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6764832 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6764833 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6764834 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6764835 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6764836 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6764837 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6764838 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6764839 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6764840 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6764841 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6764842 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6764843 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6764844 y ou can whet ones appetite but you eat at home
6764845 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6764846 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6764847 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6764848 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6764849 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6764850 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6764851 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6764852 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6764853 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6764854 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6764855 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6764856 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6764857 theyve been doing these types of tests for over 30 years now and we have never had an incident such as this

6764866 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6764867 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6764868 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6764869 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6764870 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6764871 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6764872 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6764873 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6764874 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6764875 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6764876 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6764877 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6764878 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6764879 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number questions and apparent discrepancies on this case
6764880 our athletes participating in these games all conform to the age regulations of the olympics
6764881 asians have different figures than people from the west so thats what caused their suspicion
6764882 the comparison to other land grants is critically important to us because land grants share certain common academic qualities
6764883 our strategic plan calls for us to steadily increase our measures of quality among this distinctive group
6764884 beyond the specific rankings having worked in other states for much of my career i am astounded at what higher education in alabama has been able to accomplish the state has two universities ranked in the top 50 of public institutions and one private institution in the top 100 plus a highly ranked medical school this is a major achievement
6764885 most interested in the success of the students who attend auburn and in quantifying how much they learn while they are here
6764886 the u s news ratings are based on indicators that some prospective college students may value such as general reputation or selectivity
6764887 but auburn also uses assessments that provide direct information on equally important indicators of quality such as how much students are actually learning and what kind of college experience they have
6764888 energy for the bioeconomy at auburn university auburn university college of liberal arts receives 1 million scholarship endowment
6764889 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6764890 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6764891 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6764892 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6764893 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6764894 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6764895 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6764896 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6764897 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6764898 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6764899 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6764900 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6764901 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6764902 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6764903 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6764904 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6764905 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6764906 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6764907 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6764908 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6764933 we focused on raising awareness of the great firewall of china the state sponsored information filtering apparatus that monitors and controls emails and websites within china
6764934 the great firewall is a tool used by the chinese government to stifle grass roots dissent and prevent the freedoms of speech and press us corporations play a roll in aiding and abetting the implementation of the great firewall of china though the issue is complex it requires substantially more public discussion on how u s information technology is being used to deny 1 3 billion people fundamental rights

6764959 when they passed their property tax cap and i dont blame them they might have passed it because they wanted to they might have passed it for political reasons
6764960 but for whatever reason they did it was immediate retrenchment
6764961 it was my fear it was the anxiety i expressed to senator skelos that wed wind up here
6764962 we voted for his property tax cap the assembly democrats did not agree with the democrat governor
6764963 we have to do something that gives relief to all of the property tax payers in new york state not just the property tax payers outside of the cities
6764964 the public is going to have to really speak out as to what they prefer
6764965 they are saying reductions in property taxes are less important than keeping tax rates down on millionaires
6764966 the way we want to frame this is assembly passes millionaire tax in order to provide tax cut to middle class
6764967 the reality is the cap isnt going any place and therefore wisdom says they will look at some compromise that will succeed
6764968 both houses are trying to demonstrate that they have a commitment to this issue because they know thats what voters want

6765041 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos

6765066 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6765067 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6765068 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6765069 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6765070 i understand that sen mccain was asked yesterday this question how many houses do you own and
6765071 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
6765072 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
6765073 there was just no excess baggage in terms of the writing and i really like how succinct it was
6765074 it had great strong imagery it was very new zealand without being clich
6765075 its usually about break ups feeling alone in the world
6765076 thats certainly the stuff i was concerned with when i was 16
6765077 i was walking through hastings and i see a pair of work boots outside a hair dressing salon a really upmarket one
6765078 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6765079 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6765080 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6765081 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6765082 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6765083 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6765084 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6765085 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6765086 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6765087 if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system today
6765088 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

6765090 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6765091 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6765092 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6765093 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6765094 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6765095 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6765096 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6765097 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6765098 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6765099 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto

6765102 well ive actually been approved by the government to play a show ive already sold 10 000 tickets there so i will be going to put on a concert for the fans they tend to you know sometimes not want western artists in their country i respect that but at the same time you know theres people that listen to music there and want to see their idols and stuff so its all good been approved by the government and im going to go put on a show and have fun
6765103 it is still uncertain when or if the treasury will inject capital into fannie and any effect on current holders has not been specified
6765104 common shareholders will be diluted by up to 95 due to new share issues and preferred shareholders are being asked to take a little over 20 of their initial investment as the company tries to buy back its preferred
6765105 when terrorism becomes really extensive in an area we generally no longer call it terrorism but rather war or insurgency
6765106 largely the product of sectarian violence rampant criminal activity and home grown insurgency and therefore grossly distort the global terrorism picture
6765107 it makes no sense to count civilian casualties in a war zone as deaths caused by terrorism mr zakaria wrote since the mid 1990s thousands of civilians have been killed in war zones in other countries around the world and those victims werent counted as casualties related to terrorism
6765108 obviously the war didnt fuel extremist views in muslim countries
6765109 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6765110 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio

6765112 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura

6765115 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6765116 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6765117 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6765118 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6765119 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6765120 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6765121 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6765122 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6765123 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6765124 current economic conditions as reflected in declines in stock market indices have heightened investor awareness of portfolio performance
6765125 regardless of market conditions advisors who succeed at managing the expectations of their investors can help to mitigate some of the negative effects for instance keeping investors informed by conducting regular portfolio reviews and including portfolio performance information on account statements can have a considerable impact on satisfaction
6765126 our advice to investors is that while portfolio performance is of primary importance it is only one of several dimensions that drive investor satisfaction
6765127 when shopping for an investment advisor discussing the following key issues can help determine a good fit whether the investor will be assigned to a specific advisor or team the frequency of communication about investment performance and the investors changing needs how the advisor measures investment performance what the investors expectations are the ease of use of account statements fees and other types of products and services available from the investment firm

6765130 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6765131 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6765132 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6765133 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6765134 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6765135 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6765136 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6765137 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6765138 os criminosos programaram esse ataque para que ele coincidisse com o in cio da turn de madonna marcado para s bado 23 essa uma t tica comum dos piratas que tentam explorar a empolga o causada por algum grande evento
6765139 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6765140 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6765141 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6765142 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6765143 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6765144 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6765145 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6765146 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6765147 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6765148 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6765149 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6765150 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6765151 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6765162 we are deeply disappointed and when a decision was to be made on sunday we think
6765163 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6765164 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6765165 b c also mandated that its public sector become carbon neutral as well by 2010 it was sort of slipped into the same legislation as the carbon tax announcement
6765166 theres a bit of a panic in the province as government agencies healthcare and educational institutions scramble to see how they can address this within two years if theyre not carbon neutral by then every activity that generates carbon will be taxed and the funds for this will come out of their budgets
6765167 the beauty of this approach is that organizations wont be competing with other sectors for power the zero carbon data centre would essentially have free power
6765168 they hope to do business not just with the bc government but with american organizations
6765169 there are legitimate security issues around virtualization but an enterprise could move its servers unchanged to the data centre and would only need to worry about the reliability and security of the data centre itself instead of each machine
6765170 you must have a certain voltage complex transformers switching stations and so on at your site before you can connect to the grid and then there are wheeling charges on top inco for example generates its own power for its sudbury mine but it pays expensive fees to use ontario hydros transmission line
6765171 organizations dont need to deal with utilities to set up power generating facilities in existing dams companies like general electric and westinghouse can look after setting up the turbines and maintenance
6765172 theyll know the cost of generating their own power for the next 20 years which is a major advantage in a volatile energy environment
6765173 these were built during the 1920s and 1930s during the first wave of electrification but many were abandoned by major utility companies because they were too small to be efficient some were also built by mining companies that wanted their own source of power nearby but were also abandoned when the ore was depleted google for example built its new data centre in an old aluminum smelter
6765174 almost all the provinces have task forces in place to look into reducing energy consumption by government organizations its becoming increasingly popular to mandate this as it allows provinces to show their green colours without imposing hardship on voters
6765175 its too late to switch the site as it was started five years ago but theyll need a back up data centre for their main site and a zero carbon site makes sense
6765176 but it would be a powerful political statement if it were sited in northern ontario as this would encourage economic development in remote regions there are places like thunder bay that offer renewable hydro electric sources plus the fibre optic telecom links needed
6765177 los contactos que se han ido desarrollando durante estos d as entre el ministerio de asuntos exteriores y las autoridades libias han conseguido finalmente que el barco haya atracado en tr poli donde ha bajado la tripulaci n que se encuentra en plenas condiciones de seguridad y donde finalmente ha abandonado el buque la totalidad de las personas que fueron rescatadas

6765181 i work full time but food gas everything has just gone through the roof
6765182 its horrible congress is on vacation and theyre probably soaking up the rays somewhere were soaking up high gas prices
6765183 more travelers concerned about the economy gasoline prices and rising airfares are opting to travel by train bus motorcycle and cruise ship to their holiday weekend destinations
6765184 nobody has enough gas money to fill up the truck so were not going anymore
6765185 its too expensive theres not enough money to rent a house like we normally do
6765186 some of my buddies couldnt afford it this year it just costs too much
6765187 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and business travelers are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all
6765188 i saw watchmen its f ing astounding the non disclosure agreement i signed prevents me from saying much but i can spout the following with complete joygasmic enthusiasm snyder and co have pulled it off remember that feeling of watching sin city on the big screen and being blown away by what a faithful translation of the source material it was in terms of both content and visuals triple that and youll come close to watching watchmen

6765193 we decided to write something about our own stories life in hong kong our situation this is what i did

6765205 some of the secret sauce that makes this incredibly attractive to isps is that weve created a content delivery network with the ability to get massive amounts of video out to the market very inexpensively

6765225 the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
6765226 it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost

6765250 president obama is going to have plenty on his plate in january
6765251 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6765252 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6765253 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6765254 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6765260 isso n o pode ser aceite tem que ser recusado e os planos de ordenamento devem fixar isso tem que haver projectos e uma vis o global para conjuntos como a rea metropolitana de lisboa e mais do que isso
6765261 temos de defender o solo rural pois andamos a cimentar os melhores solos perdendo um recurso fundamental para nos dar alguma autonomia alimentar

6765263 i think buffetts dollar and stock comments are a positive and thats what is moving the equity averages
6765264 buffett is widely acknowledged as a guru manages a lot of money so when somebody of that clout says something it can move markets the dollar is strengthening behind his comments

6765272 das vertrauen der anleger in eine solide entwicklung am aktienmarkt ist zurzeit gering weil auch die krise am geldmarkt an dem sich banken untereinander geld leihen noch nicht vor ber ist bieten staatliche anleihen momentan die einzige alternative f r anleger die die sicherung ihrer investition ganz oben auf ihrer priorit tenliste haben
6765273 selbst die us notenbank hat in der vergangenen woche darauf hingewiesen dass die verwerfungen am us hypothekenmarkt die nun auch den kreditkartenmarkt negativ beeinflussten viele mittelgro e banken in schwierigkeiten br chten kommt es tats chlich in den n chsten wochen zu neuen insolvenzen gr eren ausma es bei den us banken sind neue schockwellen an den aktienm rkten fast sicher davon werden dann die anleihem rkte profitieren
6765274 steuerliche anreize und sicherheit stehen bei den investoren weiterhin an erster stelle zudem finden die privatanleger das lange ende noch nicht attraktiv genug f r ein langfristiges engagement bundesanleihen und pfandbriefe werden weiter bevorzugt
6765275 die aktuelle marktlage ist f r ein solches produkt wie geschaffen die m glichkeit auf kurzfristige marktver nderungen flexibel reagieren zu k nnen verst rkt das interesse f r diesen etf
6765276 emittenten und anleger bewerten die risiken im markt realistisch schwellenl nderanleihen die sich durch eine erstklassige bonit t und attraktive konditionen auszeichnen sind nach wie vor gefragt allerdings bleibt das umsatzvolumen der jahreszeit angemessen d nn
6765277 besonders angetan hat es den anlegern eine zweij hrige anleihe der rentenbank mit einem volumen von 1 milliarde us dollar und einem kupon von 3 125 prozent isin xs0384563424 deren st ckelung in 1 000 us dollar anteilen vor allem f r privatinvestoren interessant ist

6765288 understand those of you who worked to bring laine hanson down that she asked to have her name withdrawn from consideration not because she isnt great but because she isnt petty because those two conflicting leadership traits could not live as one within her body or her soul greatness it comes in many forms sometimes it comes in the form of sacrifice thats the loneliest form now it turns out that laine hanson is a woman an american of devout principle and she has inspired me to act alike and i cannot accept senator hansons withdrawal and im now calling for an immediate voice of confirmation of laine hanson and mr speaker i would like to make this a live roll call i want to see the faces of those of you who would eliminate the possibility of greatness in american leadership because of half truths lies and innuendoes i will not be deterred by partisanship i will not be deterred by misogyny i will not be deterred by hate you have now come face to face with my will confirm my nominee heal this nation and let the american people explode into this new millennium with the exhilaration of being true to the glory of this democracy thank you

6765302 but whats clear to me is that it can only get you so far if you create a system where initiative and creativity is valued and rewarded then youll get change from the bottom up if you create a system where people are told what to do and how to do it then you will get change from the top down weve been doing top down for many years in louisiana and all we have is islands of excellence amidst a sea of mediocrity and failure

6765309 there were many tense expeditions when we were in close proximity to soviet submarines and ships
6765310 being on a sub it was constantly impressed upon us who the enemy was there would be little posters reminding us to be quiet if you accidentally closed a hatch or door too hard that sound could actually emit out into the water and give your position away
6765311 for about two weeks we were in the north atlantic in a covert area and it was necessary to remain at periscope depth which is 50 feet under water
6765312 it was hard to stay at that depth without breaking the surface and giving away our position it was extremely tense for those two weeks wed spend six hour watches in the control room just leaning over the steering mechanism with our eyes glued to the gauges as the sub bobbed up and down in the water another time we were discovered by the soviets and had to make a quick getaway
6765313 it was as close to the real thing as we could get
6765314 we had the missile launchers ready and we were all manned up we could go to war at a seconds notice not a minutes notice
6765315 while we were doing it we were using our radar to look into russia but of course we didnt tell them that
6765316 i said were not going out on deck we dont know if theyre shooting or what we checked every missile and it was the only time that ive ever seen the ready to load light steady on the monitor we sat there for a long time and eventually the captain came on and said what happened and to stand down
6765317 you lived under an air of suspicion and intrigue at the same time
6765318 being young soldiers you also had an air of cockiness about you and you felt invincible
6765319 but later i found out that this happened on a regular basis
6765320 you lived your normal life and did your job but you always looked over your shoulder wondering if you were being followed and you had to be careful what you said now as someone thats more stable in life i wonder how we lived through that but back then we loved what we were doing every soldier there was ready to do everything he could to preserve freedom
6765321 for the older georgians who remember the soviet domination i think theyre scared to death that its all going to come back
6765322 everything from communism to the social injustice and tyranny that marked that era it upsets me also because ive seen what its like for three years behind the wall and if you havent lived it you dont know what it is
6765323 regardless of who started the conflict between russia and georgia russia is taking their time to leave
6765324 if youve ever seen the dark shadow of old world communism before the wall fell its scary we had a saying when you went into east berlin you set your watch back 20 years they were that oppressed and a lot of them didnt even realize it
6765325 we had the opportunity to see how the other side lived and i actually enjoyed the experience i think it gives you a different outlook on life you dont take everything for granted and sometimes theres a price to be paid for things its a shame that we have to have it but when somebody threatens your lifestyle theres an opportunity to protect it

6765390 very many people are still not aware that there is a global sanitation crisis
6765391 policy makers and opinion leaders have never suffered the lack of adequate sanitation and if they have it is too long ago to remember the undignified inhumane circumstances these people use a fancy toilet which is connected to an effective sewer system and they are probably unaware that this toilet and its flushing system are critical to a healthy life unsgab will continue to call a spade a spade or perhaps i should say a toilet a toilet

6765476 the public do seem to have switched off not necessarily from the government as a whole but they dont seem to be engaging with gordon
6765477 even when he does something that should be ostensibly popular no one is listening
6765478 that is a very dangerous position for the government to be in
6765479 theyre entering that dreadful kind of area where almost everything they say and do is automatically rejected
6765480 i am not saying theyre entirely there but they are beginning to sink without a sign of the bottom
6765481 i am not suggesting he should break down in tears on the bbc but he has to do something simply coming up with some good ideas for a speech is not going to be enough
6765482 he could make a serious leadership speech about what people should expect over the next two or three years in terms of the economy prices and their mortgage payments
6765483 he could be honest and straightforward and say things that actually resonate with ordinary peoples experience
6765484 he doesnt recognise that he has made any mistakes whatsoever hubris is the end of all political careers and he has got it in spades
6765485 he can turn it round but that is not the same thing as saying he will turn it round
6765486 if he does what needs to be done i wont say it will be easily turn round but he can do it
6765487 but it is no longer possible to say as long as we govern well we will get our just desserts
6765488 re establish labour as a party of principle and a party of ideas and not worry about alienating people who dont share them
6765489 one of the reasons that it can be turned around is that very few people are voting for the conservatives because they like what the tory party has to say

6765515 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6765516 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6765517 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6765518 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6765519 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6765520 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

6765523 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6765524 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6765525 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6765526 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6765527 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6765528 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6765529 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6765530 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6765531 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6765532 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6765533 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6765534 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6765535 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6765536 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6765537 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6765538 we remain uncertain as to whether regions will have enough capital and reserves to withstand the current environment
6765539 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6765540 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6765541 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6765542 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6765543 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6765544 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6765545 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6765546 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6765547 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6765548 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6765549 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6765550 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6765554 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6765555 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6765556 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6765557 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6765558 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6765559 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6765560 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6765561 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6765562 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6765563 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6765564 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6765565 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6765566 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6765567 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6765568 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6765569 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6765570 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6765571 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6765572 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6765573 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6765574 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6765575 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6765576 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

6765596 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6765597 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6765598 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

6765648 by ignoring the foundations of the crisis even as the cracks were forming and propagating the fed the treasury the sec the fdic ofheo and the bond rating companies all deserve an
6765649 however since the crisis broke a year ago their performance has been much better
6765650 they have both actively tried to prevent a panic by jawboning constantly in a clear and balanced way
6765651 i give bernanke high marks for using unconventional moves such as lending treasuries with level 3 securities as collateral to unregulated investment banks possibly illegal but its easier to ask for forgiveness than permission
6765652 i give paulson medium marks for trying his darnest to talk the dollar up giving the feds medicine of interest rate cuts time to work through the economy
6765653 however i downgraded paulsons mark because i think his proposal to make the us taxpayer the bagholder for the gses is a terrible mistake and a very bad precedent
6765654 ultimately i gave bernanke a high grade and paulson an average grade although these certainly arent average times
6765655 the entire regulatory regime of the us financial community requires the largest overhaul since the great depression
6765656 to accomplish this while preventing an outright financial crisis is like trying to repair an aircraft that is sporadically losing aileron control while trying to set up final approach in turbulence

6765729 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
6765730 there seems to us no doubt on the basis of both text and history that the second amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms of course the right was not unlimited just as the first amendments right of free speech was not thus we do not read the second amendment to protect the right of citizens to carry arms for any sort of confrontation just as we do not read the first amendment to protect the right of citizens to speak for any purpose
6765731 t he most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic
6765732 the inherent right of self defense has been central to the second amendment right the d c handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of arms that is overwhelmingly chosen by american society for that lawful purpose the prohibition extends moreover to the home where the need for defense of self family and property is most acute under any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated constitutional rights banning from the home the most preferred firearm in the nation to keep and use for protection of ones home and family would fail constitutional muster
6765733 this law like almost all laws would pass rational basis scrutiny
6765734 there may be narrower scope for operation of the presumption of constitutionality i
6765735 a though we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the second amendment nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms
6765736 w e identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples our list does not purport to be exhaustive
6765737 chides us for leaving so many applications of the right to keep and bear arms in doubt and for not providing extensive historical justification for those regulations of the right that we describe as permissible but since this case represents this courts first in depth examination of the second amendment one should not expect it to clarify the entire field

6765747 but in a strange way it kind of forced everybody to look at the show differently which you dont often have an opportunity like that after seven seasons so it allowed the writers to walk in kind of with a blank slate in some ways and look at how to really reinvent and reinvigorate the show the characters the situations and the relationships so were actually all very energized i havent seen the writers room this energized in a little while not that they werent really passionate before but i think its just forced everyone to dig deep
6765748 i think the way we approach it is nobody could ever step into michael rosenbaum and lex luthors shoes
6765749 so i think that was the first thing when we sat down to really think about the season about the villains and who clark was eventually going to be fighting that was our number one thing dont try to replace lex luthor theres just no point to it we cant do it and we would never want to we honor the character we honor the actor so much but that said we looked around at who was going to be the biggest villain we could possibly bring in
6765750 what smallville always tries to do whenever they reinvent something is also try to link up eventually with what happens in the traditional mythology
6765751 you get the sense that is where the characters going so that everything kind of matches up just because he comes onto the scene as like this really great fun loving charming paramedic doesnt mean we arent also trying to figure out how to make sure that he lines up down the road
6765752 well the great thing for the four of us is that since weve been on the show as long as we have these characters it sounds kind of clich but the characters and the world and the show have a life of its own
6765753 so you cant ever come in and change some things you cant come in and do a ninety degree turn even if thats your intent because the characters are so true to themselves i think our cast does such an amazing job of embodying the characters that they really live as real people so when we talk about all the changes its probably more of an evolution than change
6765754 across the board for all characters its time to move on to the next phase of their life
6765755 which is kind of exciting so theres a lot of some sense of leaving the past behind and moving to the next part of the superman mythology
6765756 i think allison has just been such a great chloe
6765757 and will always be that chloe this year its just about opening up her world a little bit more same thing with clark kent i think that the show has been successful based on its ability to kind of give us an origin story of superman that felt real but also had some reinterpretations in it we are just following in those footsteps that al and miles created for us so clark kent is still the same clark kent we just want to get him closer to the superman that we know that the general public is more familiar with
6765758 the only thing that we are saying is that we can absolutely confirm that there is no tights so thats pretty much all we can say on that
6765759 saving people in smallville was one thing when he had to run to the factory to save chloe the roads werent very crowded the streets werent very crowded being alive in metropolis as superman is a very different experience and you will find very quickly in this season he discovers its not so easy when youre running through crowded streets or your having to run into a crowded crisis situation
6765760 or youre accountable to lois back at the daily planet
6765761 so thats what forces him to start really exploring the two worlds
6765762 the dynamic of clark and lois at the daily planet when the dailies are coming in is fantastic
6765763 it is iconic it is exactly what those two actors feel like they were meant to do i mean they are just great together and watching clark and lois together in the way that were used to seeing them from everything that we remember i think is making a really fun show this year
6765764 what is great is that she is really present in all the episodes so far shes just front and center and is doing a great job so yes there is an opportunity for more
6765765 we definitely have an episode this year that addresses a lot of the underlying tension the sexual tension and the love tension between the two of them
6765766 it was talked about in previous seasons so it is within the realm of possibility

6765779 debit cards are making us more resilient in this recession oh wait
6765780 with so much bad news breaking lately travelers have become pretty inured to the next fee the next service cut the next frequent flier devaluation the next flight cancellation
6765781 in that context any response at all is noteworthy and the reaction so far to uniteds suspension of meal service on some international flights has been vociferously negative
6765782 this is not necessarily new just the latest in a long line of claw backs of services and amenities that were once complimentary
6765783 it boggles my mind to think that they are not going to be serving meals in coach on trans atlantic flights
6765784 as far as the removal of meals in domestic business class united seems to be intent on alienating its loyal most profitable customers with this nickel and diming im fed up enough to be very seriously considering switching my loyalty to alaska

6765806 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
6765807 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

6765824 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
6765825 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6765826 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6765827 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6765828 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6765858 because eighty percent of the seafood that we eat in this country is imported its hard to tell
6765859 probably somewhere in the distribution and processing we dont want to accuse any establishment without knowing whether they were aware of it or not
6765860 i am delighted to announce the launch of kingfishers maiden international service between bangalore and londons heathrow airport we will set new standards in international travel with the unique kingfisher experience that has earned us a 5 star rating from skytrax our customers are our guests not passengers and this is reflected in the unique levels of comfort and entertainment including live television and fine dining options on board together with the warmest indian hospitality offered by a hand picked and extensively trained crew at a time when many airlines are rolling back on their network i feel that the carefully selected routes that kingfisher will serve have great growth potential international traffic demand in and out of india remains robust and the unique ties between britan and india generate attractive additional opportunities i believe that the bangalore london route is under served and the launch of kingfishers daily non stop service will exploit the latent potential that exists
6765861 our study shows that americans are better at saving money when they are thinking about it month to month on an ongoing basis rather than a long term goal

6765898 theres so many possibilities with this thing because what matters now is just the story you want to tell do you have a good story to tell then you can do it because this thing isnt specific to the series you can tell any story with this interface because its entirely contextual

6765932 c stato un tam tam incredibile prima dei giochi ma appena arrivati sembrava messo tutto sotto silenzio nessuno ci faceva pi domande abbiamo fatto bene a venire mi dicevo mi sentivo tranquilla finalmente poi mi sono ricordata del dramma del popolo tibetano mi sono sentita quasi in colpa per aver gioito per le mie due medaglie mentre nello stesso paese si reprimono le manifestazioni di gente innocente
6765933 nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6765934 the decision was taken after assessment of the presentation as well as the information available from a number of other security reports including one from the south african government
6765935 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team
6765936 we appreciate all the efforts of the icc task team the pakistan cricket board the pakistan authorities and the security consultants the players are naturally disappointed for their fans and the people of pakistan that they will not have a chance to see them in action in that country in september
6765937 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible

6765948 i havent seen coyote in over a week thats got to be some kind of record
6765949 he means that its time for the prince to come
6765950 somehow our little coyote friend got it into his head that it was time for the prince to come so he parked his behind in front the hedge to wait for him
6765951 what does coyote have to do with princes and such
6765952 dont tell me youre having fantasies about that princess whos been hibernating on the other side of that hedge
6765953 what do i want with some fifteen year old virgin whos never read a sex manual or seen a pornographic movie wheres the fun in that
6765954 i had to admit that coyote had a point there so i asked why he was waiting for the prince well he wouldnt tell me until i swore i wouldnt tell anyone else about his scheme so i promised
6765955 coyotes adventure is all over in fact this was coyotes last adventure
6765956 as you know im very busy but i did make a point of flying over that hedge at least once a day
6765957 as soon as they got to the palace coyote headed straight for the table and i have to admit that he had been right about the feast
6765958 as the prince stood there scratching his head i heard a huge crash
6765959 ow she said loudly rubbing her head and opening her eyes and there an inch in front of her face was that mangy coyote tongue hanging halfway down his chest and covered in saliva
6765960 im coyote coyote answered go back to sleep so i can continue my meal
6765961 i dont want to go back to sleep said the princess please stay here with me ill give you anything you want
6765962 how about some of that roast duckling minus the orange sauce
6765963 at once the princess jumped up and clapped her hands when the servants came running into the room she ordered them to fulfill coyotes every wish
6765964 frankly the sight of coyote lying in a soft bed piled high with eiderdown comforters being waited on by servants and having his head scratched by a princess made me sick besides i had business to attend to but finally curiosity got the best of me and i flew back
6765965 there was a flurry of activity in the kitchen yard the servants were preparing a feast that made the birthday one look like a snack i eavesdropped and learned that the princess was getting married but to who not coyote surely not coyote i flew into the apple tree in the middle of the yard where two young women were gossiping as they plucked chickens cook thinks it was the prince what done it
6765966 then who do you think done it asked the fat fair one
6765967 i think he just et hisself to death thats what i think
6765968 as soon as she said that i knew they were talking about coyote and i shook my head
6765969 the king said it was food poisoning said the fat one
6765970 yes but who poisoned the food cook says that the prince took the meal from her and said he wanted to give it to the dog hisself
6765971 whatever anyway no matter who done it im glad he dead that didnt make sense a princess fawning over a dog that way im glad she come to her senses and agreed to marry the prince
6765972 i didnt want to hear any more i flew all over the grounds hoping to see coyote somewhere all i found was a pile of stones and a maker that said beloved coyote rest in peace i bowed my head and paid my last respects to our valiant friend who has given us so many moments of fun and unexpected delight
6765973 that cook should be shot ive never had such stomach pains in my life so the prince decides to bury me in the ground as a cure i guess well it worked but he forgot to leave a place for me to get out it was so dark in there i didnt know if it was day or night
6765974 oh mole came along just in time she showed me her underground tunnel its a good thing i didnt have anything to eat while i was in the ground as it was i barely squeezed through
6765975 the uprising we see now is the latent anger against the indian state that has erupted again
6765976 we are fighting for our one right to be free
6765977 i know for sure what jesus would not do would be to sweep into a community gather up large numbers of people separate them from one another and deport them to another country in my own mind in my own conscience thats crystal clear jesus would not do that
6765978 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive
6765979 we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6765980 would be better served by helping individuals to comply with the law or working to change those laws rather than asking law enforcement agents not to enforce it
6765981 if you choose to become a law enforcement officer you swear to uphold the laws of the state and the nation
6765982 thats what you do you dont want to do that then dont become a law enforcement officer
6765983 i think its an interesting idea because from our reports a lot of these raids have really impacted families and individuals and really terrorized communities
6765984 it should be logical that some agents think that tactic is too harsh and might not want to participate
6765985 it was a very close knit friendship with one ideal to help the jews
6765986 he got really angry but i told him if youre angry we wont make a deal
6765987 he went out there and risked his neck in actual negotiations

6766027 many of you have written to me to express your disappointment in our moving
6766028 das werfen eines ziegelsteins auf das auto der pal stinensischen familie anscheinend nur eines in einer ganzen reihe von ereignissen ist in denen rechte aktivisten die pal stinensische bev lkerung angreifen
6766029 als ich sie schlie lich sah waren sie schon ber mir
6766030 sie begannen mich zu treten und zu schlagen ich konnte mich nicht sch tzen da waren etwa 25 von ihnen
6766031 sie betrachten uns als nichts anderes als moskitos nicht als menschen als w rden wir gar nicht existieren
6766032 if i just do what i normally do i should make the final that should be no problem
6766033 do you know where you can get loans in v
6766034 okay well go ahead and introduce yourself and then you can ask them a few questions
6766035 hello my name is rachel i am learning about the microfinance resources in v i am very glad to be able to be here with you today so are you here to get loans what do you use the loans for
6766036 um oh so you use them for small businesses what kind of businesses
6766037 i had some luck you have to for five events to go so well
6766038 and we had quite something to live up to but both of us finishing in the top seven in our first olympics is brilliant and shows what a strong team we have
6766039 i was loving the gb supporters they helped me so much and made it a brilliant day
6766040 my shooting was better than normal but my fencing was average and made the difference between a podium and seventh
6766041 i cant complain though the other four events went well and i had a personal best in the swim

6766046 i wont tolerate anything in my territory that tries to be scarier than me
6766047 it is simply the fish about which she is so worrying

6766050 hasta el ltimo momento intentamos convencer a la parte georgiana de no tomar ese rumbo desde el principio dijimos que ese conflicto no puede resolverse por la fuerza
6766051 ahora han invadido suelo georgiano y la integridad territorial de georgia est en peligro
6766052 vemos la destrucci n de la infraestructura civil y los llamamientos de diversos pol ticos a cambiar el gobierno democr ticamente elegido de georgia por eso es por lo que consideramos que rusia ha ido demasiado lejos
6766053 cuando antes retornen las tropas rusas al lugar donde estaban antes podr n llegar los observadores internacionales y entonces posiblemente un contingente internacional de paz
6766054 we know that the atlantic basin hurricane season peaks from august to october but long term prediction of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes is still a developing science
6766055 these events all point out the urgent need to better understand earths natural processes and how to live with them
6766056 iype recognizes that earth can be a dangerous place as our growing world population tends to settle along the coastal and mountainous areas of the continents our communities become more vulnerable to the risks of multiple hazards
6766057 we have made important strides in hazard science and reducing risk using scientific knowledge coupled with monitoring and warning systems there is however much still to learn
6766058 it is critical to partner with communities engineers government officials and emergency preparedness personnel to successfully prepare for disasters and build resilient communities
6766059 last year we sold martin skrtel to liverpool for 10 million and now probably arshavin will go to spurs
6766060 they went a nice even gallop so she sat in behind and she has quickened up nicely
6766061 dramani remains with lokomotiv until the end of the season
6766062 from a footballing point of view he possesses many of the attributes i like in a great player
6766063 i dont think he will have any problems settling into our team or playing in the premier league although he will obviously need some time to adjust to the english game
6766064 seek ye first homestead incomes and the rest will be added unto you
6766065 your excellency i support the disarmament programme but you thought i was a liar
6766066 although you brought in bad groups like that of alaso
6766067 weve got unprecedented demand for season tickets parking spaces single game tickets etc
6766068 people want to know what theyre eating and they want to get their moneys worth
6766069 our office has been involved in the investigation of thousands of pounds of mislabeled imported fish
6766070 louisa and i love to go out to sushi restaurants and i was wondering if we could apply the barcoding technology to find out what sushi we were eating
6766071 i thought sushi stores that we go to would be 100 percent correct
6766072 because eighty percent of the seafood that we eat in this country is imported its hard to tell
6766073 probably somewhere in the distribution and processing we dont want to accuse any establishment without knowing whether they were aware of it or not
6766074 the absence of such signage has been a blessing as the towns brokers and homeowners have sought to maintain in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary that they are immune to the ravages of the credit crisis
6766075 if brokers signs were allowed the town might look from the right distance like a giant and very expensive tag sale
6766076 of projects commenced in good times now languishing in bad
6766077 there are still plenty of these houses that are selling
6766078 we had reached an agreement with everton for the loan of tiago all that was needed was the players agreement and that never came
6766079 we take it therefore that tiago will stay with us
6766080 its not going to be added before the game on saturday and thats what were concentrating on now
6766081 there always is frustration because were keen to add to the squad
6766082 hes been a miss you can see by the results we get that hes an important member of the team
6766083 but weve not had him for a long time and we were quite successful last season when he wasnt there its not a one man band far from it
6766084 weve started the season with two victories and we want to keep that run going
6766085 it was disappointing not to win the league there last season but that match is already out of our system we just have to win this game now
6766086 we are really excited by the broad spectrum of games we are showcasing at the german game convention and in particular the exciting new developments on guitar hero world tour call of duty world at war and quantum of solace
6766087 not only will guitar hero world tour now be available on wii freestyle but we have added a host of iconic anthems to the european playlist to give guitar hero fans a wider choice of tracks to rock out to
6766088 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers
6766089 our responsibility is to make sure that we create a law that regardless of the technology includes a set of legal guarantees that consumers have with respect to their information
6766090 have catastrophic economic effects on millions of already stressed u s consumers
6766091 nosotros estuvimos en barajas justo antes de que partiera ese avi n as que sabemos todo lo que est n sufriendo y nos unimos a ellos es un d a muy triste ha sucedido algo horrible

6766093 there are other hills to climb and its been a great run im looking forward to the retirement cake
6766094 kony is prepared to return to the talks for a peaceful solution to the rebellion without any difficulties or wrangling we know that there are problems within the agreement and we are going to look at all of these
6766095 i think the icc warrant is a very obnoxious situation in this agreement

6766098 simons gone all out to americanise it with the helicopters the cars and glamming it up i think that worked incredibly well but i got incredibly frustrated with the sob stories as the show went on
6766099 you need to give people the benefit of the doubt from their performance and then later on in the show maybe show whats happened in their life but to do it so early on i found a bit cringeworthy and frustrating overall i found the show entertaining but it was just that element that bugged me

6766114 he was always about the music he was like a tough jazz musician he was always more about how you play than how the crowd bought it he was always talking music
6766115 when he came to dmb he brought a whole new foundation as a sax player there was a confidence when someone was using those scales and coming from his school he was one of the best sax players ive ever heard
6766116 he was very much the king of a lot of things he did i have great memories of staying up late in the studio working on music collages with him

6766119 the athletes from the united states have exceeded our goals already
6766120 overall we look at this as one of the great successes in u s olympic history
6766121 we had anticipated that would be the case coming in considering the resources they had placed in a very targeted manner to win the gold medal count
6766122 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
6766123 its going to be very difficult to dislodge china the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be
6766124 were not displeased at where we are in the gold medal count
6766125 well learn from this well learn from the chinese but with the resources that weve had available weve done remarkably well
6766126 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way
6766127 i would say at these games we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes of the results but were not disappointed in any team or any individual athlete
6766128 the conduct of athletes all around has been what they said they were going to do to respect our hosts respect our country and do their best
6766129 nobody else in any walk of life is able to do that
6766130 the olympic movement is testimony that the world can get to know each other i think history will say these games found a a new level though the efforts of the chinese people
6766131 i think the chicago team has done very very well and the olympic family realizes the quality of their effort and the quality of their bid
6766132 its a very weak position for the u s but our two ioc members are very special

6766211 the french soldiers one by one saluted the head of state who is also commander in chief some soldiers exchanged a few words with him others limited themselves to a handshake the oppressive silence in the french headquarters at nato in the afghan headquarters was only interrupted by the deafening screams of planes landing at the nearby airport
6766212 i wanted to say to you that the work you are doing here is indispensable why are we here because what is at stake here is a part of the worlds liberty this is where the struggle against terrorism is being carried out i have no doubts we must be here i was also stunned by what took place i tell you in good conscience if i had to do it again i would
6766213 all the dead and wounded were hit in the first moments
6766214 we stayed four hours without reinforcements we had no more ammunition to defend ourselves with any weapons besides our famas assault rifles
6766215 the official story seems extremely incomplete compared to the accounts of the french soldiers wounded in the ambush contrary to the official story the fatalities did not all occur in the initial moments of the fighting according to the soldiers asked about this matter but as it went on
6766216 fifteen to 20 minutes after the engagement of forces a support section left the base camp and arrived at the theater in 40 50 minutes then a second section left then helicopters were engaged
6766217 a professional army is of necessity an army of young people our soldiers are trained for months are prepared for months before leaving for afghanistan
6766218 the level of operational preparation corresponded to what we were obligated to give them for this mission
6766219 participation in the afghan occupation has been supported by nearly all political forces and has never been put in question in principle however the methods employed in this policy have been discussed paris has demanded a revision of nato strategy whose failure is evident it is time to redefine the alliances objectives and its means of action the president must explain to france why its soldiers are dying 6 000 kilometers from its territory
6766220 didnt want to talk to the president or the politicians
6766221 the army changed him the last few months he was more tense than usual as if he were being hunted even when he slept soldiers inevitably no longer are men they become weapons he only thought about the army he passed the tests without conviction but when he was admitted to the parachutists he was so proud that he wanted to go on
6766222 he wasnt allowed to say exactly what he was doing but we understood that essentially it was horrible
6766223 what weve noticed in recent operations is a greater capacity from the taliban to organise and maneouvre and as we saw in this incident they dont seem to have any problems securing ammunition
6766224 france is determined to continue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just
6766225 political chat sites and newspaper blogs have been inundated with comments denouncing sarkozys transatlantic drift which has sent young men out to fight a war which has nothing to do with them
6766226 we shouldnt have sent these young men to go and get killed whats certain is that they died in an ambush like game animals
6766227 our soldiers cant die for uncle sam these soldiers were doing their duty but they did not die for france they died in the endless war that the united states is fighting in afghanistan to defend their own interests
6766228 the number of victims is notably explained according to these soldiers by the slowness of the reaction of the command and serious problems of coordination
6766229 we had no ammunition left to protect ourselves with other than our famas assault rifles
6766230 the insurgents began attacking with rockets and mortars at 11 p
6766231 a fierce battle raged through much of the night until 7 a m tuesday said arsala jamal the governor of khost american helicopter strikes against the militants who were moving through a cornfield around the base also struck a house in a village killing two children and wounding two women and two men the provincial police chief abdul qayum baqizoy said
6766232 targetting us and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
6766233 they clearly believe they are winning now and its causing them to be a bit more audacious
6766234 sends a clear message that current western strategy in afghanistan is failing until now western leaders have been in denial about the true extent of taliban presence in afghanistan and their ability to move swiftly on the afghan capital
6766235 a new troop deployment is required simply to secure the capital with the taliban on the very doorstep of the afghan capital the situation can only get worse for nato isaf forces and the afghan people

6766260 we cannot stand on the sidelines while others including our critics attempt to define what the church teaches
6766261 that work is to help those who are not lds to understand its doctrine it also includes getting members of the lds church to know the doctrine weve got to get on the same page millet said
6766262 according to millet the apostle said he didnt know anything about that planetary stuff but that the point was for us to strive to become more like god and more like christ the apostle quoted several scriptures that indicated the possibility of becoming more like god including
6766263 the father has promised us that through our faithfulness we shall be blessed with the fullness of his kingdom in other words we will have the privilege of becoming like him to become like him we must have all the powers of godhood thus a man and his wife when glorified will have spirit children who eventually will go on an earth like this one we are on and pass through the same kind of experiences being subject to mortal conditions and if faithful then they also will receive the fullness of exaltation and partake of the same blessings there is no end to this development it will go on forever we will become gods and have jurisdiction over worlds and these worlds will be peopled by our own offspring

6766308 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6766309 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6766310 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6766311 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6766312 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6766313 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6766314 graduate level it programs and schools that are giving graduates the best deal in terms of salary increases or promotions vs cost of tuition and that are best at gearing their curriculum to the everyday demands of todays it workplace
6766315 his cousin said vincent was playing in the ditch and he was going to go back to call his friends to where he was playing
6766316 it doesnt appear she was speeding and she didnt have a stop sign
6766317 ball high is on the right track we have work to do no doubt but overall the staff is doing a good job
6766318 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
6766319 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
6766320 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6766321 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6766322 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6766323 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6766324 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6766325 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6766326 ive told the president the directors and the coach that my aim is to leave real madrid
6766327 im telling the truth i want to leave and i have got the character to tell the press that im not aiming to stay at real madrid i want to play in the premier league next season
6766328 chelsea have a great squad a great team and their offer is good for me and for the team it isnt because of money it is simply because i want to leave my personal aim is to be the best player in the world and that isnt going to be possible at real madrid
6766329 ive finished my cycle ive played three seasons at real madrid and have given everything i have scored goals won two leagues and that isnt easy i think my period at real madrid has come to an end
6766330 i hope the directors reach an agreement with chelsea to resolve my situation as quickly as possible
6766331 thats why gary neville is captain and when hes not playing ryan has taken over if ryan is not available then rio stands in
6766332 in the long term rio will be captain no question about that im very comfortable with that
6766333 his qualities of leadership have improved tremendously over the last two or three years and ability wise it is there for all to see
6766334 it was always him or john terry and it was the flip of a coin
6766335 it could have gone either way i am sure it was a close call
6766336 its not a reflection other than a personal choice and john terry has been captain of chelsea for quite a while and that has to go into consideration
6766337 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6766338 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6766339 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6766340 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6766341 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6766342 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6766343 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6766344 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6766345 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6766346 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6766347 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6766348 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6766349 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6766350 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6766351 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6766352 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6766353 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6766354 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6766355 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6766356 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6766357 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6766358 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6766359 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6766360 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6766361 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6766362 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6766363 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6766364 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6766365 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6766366 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6766367 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6766368 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6766369 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6766370 they told me there are going to be resources here
6766371 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6766372 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6766373 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6766374 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6766375 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6766376 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6766377 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6766378 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6766379 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6766380 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6766381 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6766382 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6766383 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6766384 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6766385 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6766386 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6766387 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6766388 last year we sold martin skrtel to liverpool for 10 million and now probably arshavin will go to spurs
6766389 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6766390 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6766391 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6766392 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6766393 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6766394 dramani remains with lokomotiv until the end of the season
6766395 we had reached an agreement with everton for the loan of tiago all that was needed was the players agreement and that never came
6766396 we take it therefore that tiago will stay with us
6766397 its not going to be added before the game on saturday and thats what were concentrating on now
6766398 there always is frustration because were keen to add to the squad
6766399 hes been a miss you can see by the results we get that hes an important member of the team
6766400 but weve not had him for a long time and we were quite successful last season when he wasnt there its not a one man band far from it
6766401 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6766402 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6766403 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6766404 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6766405 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6766406 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6766407 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6766408 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6766409 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6766410 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6766411 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6766412 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6766413 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6766414 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6766415 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6766416 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6766417 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6766418 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6766419 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6766420 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6766421 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6766422 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6766423 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6766424 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6766425 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6766426 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6766427 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6766428 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6766429 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6766430 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6766431 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6766432 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6766433 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6766434 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6766435 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6766436 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6766437 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6766438 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6766439 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6766440 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6766441 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6766442 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6766443 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6766444 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6766445 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6766446 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6766447 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6766448 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6766449 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6766450 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6766451 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6766452 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6766453 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6766454 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6766455 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6766456 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6766457 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6766458 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6766459 from a footballing point of view he possesses many of the attributes i like in a great player
6766460 i dont think he will have any problems settling into our team or playing in the premier league although he will obviously need some time to adjust to the english game
6766461 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6766462 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6766463 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6766464 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6766465 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6766466 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6766467 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6766468 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6766469 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6766470 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6766471 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6766472 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6766473 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6766474 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6766475 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6766476 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6766477 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6766478 fed a steady diet of corporate controlled advertising which manipulates quirks of the human brain read jerry manders
6766479 to increase consumer spending and pro corporate news is it any wonder the average american is a mess
6766480 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6766481 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6766482 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6766483 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6766484 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6766485 there were no injuries and the cause is still under investigation
6766486 the owner complained of having electrical problems in the past
6766487 were looking into that it appears maybe it started in the kitchen area thats where the breaker box was
6766488 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6766489 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6766490 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6766491 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6766492 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6766493 thank you jesus i didnt i wanted to see it operate first
6766494 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6766495 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6766496 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6766497 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6766498 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6766499 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6766500 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6766501 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6766502 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6766503 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6766504 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6766505 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6766506 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6766507 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6766508 i would like to see if the law in this country can become such that there are stricter controls particularly on dangerous dogs so that their breeding and distribution can be controlled more stringently than is the case at the moment
6766509 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6766510 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
6766511 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6766512 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6766513 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6766514 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6766515 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6766516 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6766517 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6766518 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6766519 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6766520 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6766521 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6766522 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6766523 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6766524 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6766525 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6766526 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6766527 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6766528 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6766529 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6766530 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6766531 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6766532 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6766533 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6766534 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6766535 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6766536 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick

6766545 ultimately a new theory of firm decision making behavior might be used as a basis for a theory of markets but at least in the short run we should distinguish between a theory of microbehavior on the one hand and the micro assumptions appropriate to a theory of aggregate economic behavior on the other in the present volume we will argue that we have developed the rudiments of a reasonable theory of firm decision making

6766583 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6766584 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

6766588 my life was sad before because i had to crawl on the ground
6766589 when someone loses a limb they immediately know what theyve lost
6766590 the goal is to restore the healthy self image again so that that person can see themselves whole
6766591 when i finally got into the field of orthotics and prosthetics i said ah ha
6766592 to deliver an artificial limb or brace without follow up doesnt help that person in the long run
6766593 we need to make sure that they have what they need to continue living successfully for years to come
6766594 someone might say i wanna bring 10 people with me next time you come the mixed blessing is theyll bring 50 or 100 people that have physical needs
6766595 the difficulty for me is how do i say no
6766596 it opens a whole other door for many of these folks to experience the world in a way in which theyve never even dreamt of
6766597 and the world has an opportunity to greet them accept them and welcome them back into society so its a double blessing
6766598 if we had a surgeon here we could see eight to 10 patients in a weekend and change their lives forever
6766599 its tough for people to make the choice to give up time with their families and a portion of their income to extend themselves in this way but take it from me the more we give the more we get

6766602 i never heard from her i still havent to this day
6766603 id like to think forgiveness is possible but when her name comes up in conversation i have a tendency to spit out of the side of my mouth
6766604 i realized that i didnt need her drama in my life
6766605 what we found is that when men recalled their own offenses they were more likely to empathize and then forgive but they had to do that emotional work first
6766606 when the women started thinking about their own offenses they tended to feel defensive and guilty and that made it harder for them to forgive
6766607 my father was physically abusive but the most intense hurt was his refusal to talk to me after i hit him
6766608 i just didnt know how to start the process of forgiving
6766609 it wasnt until i was in my forties when i was able to empathize with my fathers situation that he had learned ineffective parenting from his parents and that he was short tempered because he was physically ill that i was able to forgive him
6766610 this was the 60s and early 70s and there were not resources that we knew of to help us
6766611 forgiving my father and my mother for staying helped me learn to trust my instincts and myself be more present in relationships and build loving honest bonds with others
6766612 forgive for love the missing ingredient for a healthy and lasting relationship
6766613 now i can remember good things about him he was an incredibly effective childrens advocate and community organizer in harlem for example
6766614 the things he passed on to me my sense of justice fairness political sensitivity history and my power as a voting consumer are greater gifts than the scars he left behind
6766615 if im now seated in the chair to gods right gods now comfortably seated in the chair on the left which is the chair of evil and gods evil is perfect gods evil is righteous gods evil is holy and gods evil will be done

6766629 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity versus productivity
6766630 less than half a day goes by and youll get an e mail saying why havent you responded to my e mail
6766631 the expectation because youve sent it is the other person is looking at his screen all the time and his job is to look at his screen waiting for e mails
6766632 distracted the erosion of attention and the coming dark age
6766633 were so overloaded by information bites that were less and less able to go deeply to create knowledge or wisdom out of all the information
6766634 this is one reason why i say were on the cusp of a dark age

6766642 well i noticed youre dressed all in black and since cretans love the color of black i just thought you were from crete as i am
6766643 youre kidding me our priests wear the long black robes and stove pipe type hats
6766644 im a greek orthodox priest from the u s and there most of our priests when not in church wear the black suit and clerical shirt
6766645 it is a symbol a white tab representing my priestly calling
6766646 i can see that but what does it mean to you and why do you wear it
6766647 i dont know ive worn it most of my life and besides that its very trendy and fashionable i think it is sexy
6766648 was crucified with him so that the sinful body might be destroyed
6766649 if anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whoever desires to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it for what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world and is himself destroyed or lost

6766655 we ask russia to tear up the agreement on friendship cooperation and partnership with ukraine and to file territorial claims to ukraine
6766656 while russia sent aid to flood hit ukrainian regions ukraine failed to help russia to force georgia to peace and took an openly hostile stance
6766657 ukraine has proved by its policies that it is not a friend but an enemy to russia
6766658 i dont know i just didnt have it its a hell of a time not to have it
6766659 thats the worst 1 000 metres i have put together in years i was a spectator

6766666 where have you been all week i need some attention and a treat
6766667 i had my gear on and had to go to the bathroom
6766668 i was making my way there when i passed a mirror in the hallway
6766669 seeing myself wearing that maple leaf well it was unbelievable
6766670 at that moment it really sunk in im really a toronto maple leaf
6766671 you hear about the hockey atmosphere guys tell you what its like but until you see it in person until you actually see all those kids watching you practice in the middle of the summer well its hard to believe
6766672 hes a player who is getting better he was colorados shutdown guy and played well over 20 minutes a game in the last half of the season we feel he has tremendous upside and has potential
6766673 of course i paid attention to what was going on
6766674 some people might say the criticism of me is unfair but i wouldnt i can see why some things would be said about me im coming from the western conference ive played fewer than 100 nhl games in my career
6766675 when you go out and have a game like this it builds confidence
6766676 but im not going to read too much into it my next start im going to go out hungry and try to compete
6766677 we hebben geen enkele reden om aan te nemen dat dergelijke gezichtstransplantaties in de toekomst niet net zo vaak zullen voorkomen als lever of niertransplantaties
6766678 these results prove that most americans want to be fair to gay people
6766679 our aspiration is to always see each other as individuals first and though we may not always succeed at that our underlying fairness and decency means that one day soon we will this marks tremendous progress for our community and for the voting public
6766680 more proof of the vast left conspiracy out to stop hillary
6766681 its kind of funny that it took me moving to the arctic to pick up gardening
6766682 if you want something you just buy it and try not to look at the price
6766683 but when you grow it yourself it doesnt get any fresher than that
6766684 but once i get good at it it should be okay
6766685 everyone is talking about the same issue everyone is against the way georgia behaved i also support russia
6766686 we both kicked at the same point but hers went in
6766687 at the end i think i lacked a little bit of energy
6766688 if i squeezed a little more if id made one last kick but i didnt have the juice
6766689 the problem is that this government has been so long in power it has run out of imagination innovation and creativity
6766690 like a rabbit caught in headlights it does nothing sees no possibilities
6766691 he was able to convince the public that he was a tough talking action man when in fact he was slavishly colluding in bertie aherns policy of appeasement of caving into one vested interest after another
6766692 of surrendering the future to buy the present in good times you can get away with that in tough times appeasement comes home to roost
6766693 the government is silent on how it intends to help the tens of thousands of people currently losing their jobs
6766694 we should rediscover our determination to build a nation where nobody feels abandoned and lost where diversity is a strength where children are protected where we dream dreams and have the confidence and competence to turn those dreams into shining realities
6766695 brain cowen earned his spurs by years of hard work and diligence by being one of the outstanding intellects of his political generation whilst still retaining the interests of people at heart
6766696 he earned it by stellar performances across five challenging ministries and he maintains that respect and support today
6766697 if fianna f il put its reputation for competence up for sale on ebay today i doubt if they could get a single serious bid
6766698 his indecision and his fatal tendency to make bad situations worse as his handling of the lisbon referendum displayed
6766699 said carrie gordon earll senior director of issue analysis at focus on the family action
6766700 i believe its the right thing to do were going to make sure that indigent people get the best representation in ontario county
6766701 we are not perfect but we have done the job and we are working to improve those areas which need improvement
6766702 hvis man gik over til dotdks forretningsmodel som er baseret p et non profit engrosled kombineret med et kommercielt og ureguleret detail led ville det derimod med stor sandsynlighed f re til mindre gennemsigtighed mindre valgfrihed og dyrere priser set fra den enkelte dom nenavnsbrugers perspektiv
6766703 with freedom that college affords students comes a lot of responsibility
6766704 depending on what year the student is entering the start of a new school year can mean having to decide on a major meeting requirements for that major or deciding on or looking for a job associated with the major
6766705 many students support themselves on campus so the beginning of the semester means budgeting for tuition books housing and anything else they need for school
6766706 a few benefits include seeing friends living on your own activities connected with school such as homecoming and football games and of course exciting new classes
6766707 im looking forward to purdue basketball because ive always been a fan since i was little
6766708 i think the best way is to come a few days earlier than is absolutely necessary
6766709 spend some time on campus and spend time with friends catching up
6766710 thinking about what classes you have and what you will need for them can get students excited about classes
6766711 if not it can make the transition a bit easier than if they wait until the week after classes start to get supplies like books
6766712 it raises the college of liberal arts and universitys profile in issues that interest the people of indiana such as immigration and the need for more cooperation and collaboration with universities in latin america for example unam in cuernavaca and the universidad austral de chile
6766713 another potential contribution of this new program comes in the form of better research on the changing demographics in the us and its impact on higher education
6766714 universities are going to have to adapt and change to ensure that our society has the educated citizens it needs to prosper
6766715 in light of the changing demographics and pressures from globalization the people of indiana and the us need to learn more about latin america and about the immigrants to the us that come from there
6766716 dean contreni in the college of liberal arts had the vision to see the need and the potential for this program and worked to make it a reality here on our campus
6766717 filled part of the void in lacking a latino studies program
6766718 would send a message to our latino population that the culture matters to purdue and matters enough to have a commitment to scholarly study
6766719 the summer ceremony typically has a higher number of graduate candidates than the other ceremonies but participation typically stays the same
6766720 right now they have plenty of extras so students just need to come in to hovde hall room 55
6766721 what makes it also quite interesting is that its low cost technology
6766722 at purdue we do these things in a special way
6766723 my grandma taught me the basics and i kind of taught myself past what she knew now she asks me for advice
6766724 i told my adviser that if i couldnt get in to the major im going to a different school
6766725 i am definetely the girl off of the devil wears prada but people are so nice it doesnt feel like it
6766726 its a young company and it has a lack of organization
6766727 ive gone in there and helped them figure things out
6766728 the greatest thing im taking away from the internship is my relationships there
6766729 its a small company but everyone has a warmth about them
6766730 everyone was so welcoming its going to be hard leaving im used to being pampered
6766731 it wasnt what i wanted to do but experience speaks volumes
6766732 you never know where life will take you theres so much out there
6766733 the work he does on heavy metals and blood brain barriers is significant he has a very solid record of administrative experience with respect to the graduate program in the school of health sciences
6766734 im confident hes going to do an outstanding job of leading the school
6766735 with any tenure five years is about the time to take leadership
6766736 we want to make sure we have the highest quality of curriculum to attract students on both the undergraduate and graduate levels
6766737 we want the highest quality research so the faculty will be proud of what they do in their area and bring research dollars to purdue so we can expand the program
6766738 we want to give our service to the community locally nationally and internationally
6766739 jeg vil have en som er selvst ndig en som kan presse mig p mine forudindtagede ideer og en som kan udfordre mig s vi f r en god debat i det hvide hus
6766740 if it is not handled properly we could have a security issue
6766741 you dont want to give anybody a reason to turn back to al qaeda
6766742 some people from the government encouraged us to fight against al qaeda but it seems that now that al qaeda is finished they dont want us anymore
6766743 sacrificed and fought against al qaeda and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them
6766744 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
6766745 i dont think that area would have been calmed without those guys
6766746 like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again
6766747 they committed crimes and attacked the iraqi army and the american army and there is no way to rehabilitate them
6766748 we dont want this to be a dead end kick them to the curb kind of thing
6766749 our men worked hard and deserve appreciation and not punishment from the government
6766750 america is the only one asking us not to fight the maliki government
6766751 part of them will fight the government if they are not recruited into the security forces
6766752 they thought they were doing the right thing reaching for the american dream
6766753 predators knew where they were more apt to find their victims
6766754 you never know who is really in one these scams
6766755 you never think a friend would do that to you i was shocked
6766756 if someone is at foreclosures door i can only help them if they are able to afford their house payment
6766757 the question i ask now is can you show me that you can afford a 1 900 a month payment or whatever it might be because if you cant show me that theres nothing i can do about it the reality is that not everyone can be helped i do turn people away
6766758 you live and learn they didnt really understand what it was
6766759 absolutely i have made money i have no apologies for that
6766760 people dont recognize this for the scandal that it is
6766761 i dont see how were not going to be right back where we started in a few years
6766762 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error
6766763 i cant provide odds on whether dropped votes were not recognized
6766764 but based on what we know about how our customers run their elections and reconcile counts we believe any results not uploaded on election night would have been caught when elections were being certified
6766765 voters in jurisdictions premier serves both in ohio and throughout the country can be assured that election officials employing standard canvass and crosscheck procedures will count their votes completely and accurately
6766766 as far as i know we have not seen that problem
6766767 we cant solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them
6766768 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
6766769 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6766770 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6766771 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6766772 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6766773 we are excited to be working more closely with npd and enterbrain this partnership represents a great opportunity to benefit not only our clients but the industry as a whole by providing a comprehensive industry supported view of sales across the three largest video game markets
6766774 getting ready for the launch we did massive amounts of performance testing built capacity model after capacity model and yet with all of that you threw so much traffic our way that we need to add more capacity
6766775 o brasil infelizmente n o d import ncia para o futebol feminino e a olimp ada a melhor chance de mostrar servi o para tentar alguma coisa num time de fora no brasil a jogadora n o tem condi es para sobreviver
6766776 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6766777 i find it shocking that they would take this kind of risk
6766778 britons waste the equivalent of around two power stations worth of electricity each year by leaving tv sets and other gadgets on standby
6766779 mti micro have been putting their mobion fuel cell through its paces in testing intended to demonstrate just how much improved the technology is over current li ion power packs a lab test version of the fuel cell lasted 2 700 hours of continuous use with further tests suggesting power degradation of less than 15 percent
6766780 sustainability is no longer enough now we must augment such notions and strategies with innovative low cost inventions that can be taken and replicated over and over again throughout the world their role is to popularize technology free of any need for financial reward yet fully in the knowledge that their innovative technologies are helping to make the lives of poorer people around the world better

6766819 the athletes from the united states have exceeded our goals already u s olympic committee chairman peter ueberroth said friday in an interview with the associated press
6766820 overall we look at this as one of the great successes in u s olympic history usoc chief executive officer jim scherr said citing medals in team sports and across a spread of different events and disciplines
6766821 the chinese obviously wont be caught at these games scherr said
6766822 we had anticipated that would be the case coming in considering the resources they had placed in a very targeted manner to win the gold medal count
6766823 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future ueberroth said
6766824 its going to be very difficult to dislodge china the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic its much more difficult for the rest of the world to compete but thats the way it should be
6766825 were not displeased at where we are in the gold medal count scherr said
6766826 well learn from this well learn from the chinese but with the resources that weve had available weve done remarkably well
6766827 any time you have 600 athletes competing in 31 sports youre going to have disappointments and youll have surprises along the way scherr said
6766828 i would say at these games we may have been disappointed based on the outcomes of the results but were not disappointed in any team or any individual athlete
6766829 the conduct of athletes all around has been what they said they were going to do to respect our hosts respect our country and do their best he said
6766830 we predicted the chinese would put on terrific games he said
6766831 nobody else in any walk of life is able to do that he said
6766832 the olympic movement is testimony that the world can get to know each other i think history will say these games found a a new level though the efforts of the chinese people
6766833 i think the chicago team has done very very well and the olympic family realizes the quality of their effort and the quality of their bid
6766834 its a very weak position for the u s but our two ioc members are very special ueberroth said

6766893 showcases a deep dimension of lyrical honesty and vulnerability a hallmark of natalies music these days yet sonically she embraces her more progressive rock pop side replete with live horns grittier guitar licks and the distinct r and b flair of her voice thats often been toned down in the past

6766897 in 2004 i was sitting comfortably in my suburban house drinking tea and half watching an episode of law and order as i was chilling out or really more zoning out in front of my television something on the screen caught my attention a little girl was being sold as a sex slave to some man in a suit in new york city new york what okay so i know its just a tv show but i thought law and order was always loosely based on some sort of reality and some guy was buying a kid out of a van ive bought designer knock off hand bags out of a van in nyc but a child come on this was in no way real right or was it i couldnt shake what i was seeing they were depicting human trafficking which at that point i had never heard of before i googled when in doubt thats what i do i google what i discovered through that one search rocked me to the core and would change my life forever
6766898 its amazing to me that god would lead me to this pop culture led me to it you can find good and bad everywhere

6766914 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure
6766915 ill have to check with my staff now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you have to make 5 million and if you do not know how many houses you have then it is not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6766916 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment i am questioning his judgment
6766917 voters think by almost two to one that he has been more negative in his mccains campaigning that barack obama
6766918 having said that however we know that in our business voters always complain about negative campaigning but it also works and so the great irony here is that despite the fact that mccain is seen as overwhelmingly running the more negative campaign people think that what they have heard about barack obama is more negative than what they have heard about john mccain and this is an example of a situation where negative does work

6766967 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat

6766970 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6766971 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them

6767029 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6767030 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6767031 i wasnt aware of it i saw him at the hall of fame and he said he was feeling fine
6767032 he looked a little thinner than usual but he never indicated to me that he was struggling with anything

6767051 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
6767052 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses

6767056 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6767057 in terms of whos an elitist i think people have made a judgment that john mccain is not an arugula eating pointy headed professor type based on his life story
6767058 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6767059 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6767063 no one can cede jerusalem the city from which the prophet muhammad ascended to the heavens

6767065 the israeli arabs are safeguarding the al aqsa mosque it is as if they are inside the belly of a whale they represent the islamic nation we send them our regards especially to sheikh raed salah founder of islamic movement in israel
6767066 according to most all reports on secret peace talks or agreements israel is refusing to relinquish jerusalem and the west bank refuses to accept the right of return of palestinian refugees refuses to dismantle the settlements and deems the jordan valley vital to its security

6767082 were trying to play that level of competition because thats where we want to take this program
6767083 were not going to make the same mistake we made the past two years were not going to take any conference team lightly
6767084 and the problem with looking that far ahead is that can get you into serious trouble that could damage a team bad we sat down as seniors and we made it a strict goal we want to take everything one day one practice one meeting one game at a time everything one
6767085 when everythings done well look back maybe we did maybe we didnt we won some we lost some its going to show

6767143 major efforts and there have been no complaints against hezbollah

6767167 what we are facing is a numbers shortage there is no way we will be able to survive at our current level if it continues like this
6767168 it will be impossible to have any improvement this season if we do not improve the numbers greatly
6767169 now we are more players short than then so if we are in a worse position there is no way we can achieve again what we did last season we are trying to make it better and working hard on the current situation
6767170 this is probably the toughest period i have had as everton manager mainly because a lot of my concentration at the moment is not with the players i have here and they are the most important but with trying to bring new players in

6767177 the crucial element was the modelling of the heating and cooling of the gas as this tells us how much mass is needed for part of the gas to have enough gravity to overcome its own gas pressure and thus form a star the heating is caused by the extreme compression of the cloud as it is squashed and pulled apart by the black hole this is balanced by the cooling which requires detailed knowledge of how quickly the radiation can escape the cloud

6767183 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team

6767194 die erwartungen einer us zinsanhebung haben sich auf das fr hjahr n chsten jahres verschoben und die auguren d rften die minutes auf eine best tigung ihrer erwartungen hin durchsuchen

6767197 wir haben die behauptungen der raketenabwehrbeh rde gepr ft unseren analysen zufolge ist es technisch unm glich dass das system jemals so funktioniert wie man uns glauben machen will
6767198 bei den abfangraketen in polen spielt washington nicht mit offenen karten
6767199 das stimmt aber nicht eine simple analyse zeigt dass diese abfangraketen sofern sie funktionieren viel schneller sind als die raketenabwehrbeh rde vorgibt sie werden schnell genug fliegen um russische interkontinentalraketen abschie en zu k nnen

6767258 in an election of this magnitude it is imperative that journalists across the country are provided with the information about barack obamas thin record that is necessary to report the news in a balanced way
6767259 sometimes it takes a lot of e mails phone calls and knocks on the door to ensure readers are informed of barack obamas inexperience and lack of energy solutions john mccain and republicans across the country are committed to ensuring that everyone has access to our side of the story

6767269 the ostentation which possession of great wealth enabled the jews to display and their unconcealed contempt for the practices of christianity made them an object of universal dislike as usurers moreover they had gained a strangle hold on the recently founded monastic houses whose splendid buildings they had financed and on many of the smaller aristocratic families
6767270 divers jews taking alarm at the troublous state of the realm went overseas to normandy
6767271 in quam nullus iudeus aliquibus temporibus habitare consueverit aut morari
6767272 in that no one lending a share or portion dwelling temporarily has been accustomed or hindered see
6767273 in quam nullus iudeus aliquibus temporibus habitare consueverit aut morari
6767274 they still have their repair three or four days in the week because they own a house in the town
6767275 all the world suffers from the usury of the jews their monopolies and deceit they have brought many unfortunate peoples into a state of poverty especially farmers working class people and the very poor
6767276 modern enquirers after careful examination of the facts have concluded that the child probably lost consciousness in consequence of a cataleptic fit and was buried prematurely by his relatives
6767277 they the jews circumcise and attempt to crucify a child at norwich the offenders are condemned in a fine of 20 000 marks
6767278 the body of hugh was given burial in the cathedral and treated as that of a martyr when the minster was repaved the skeleton of a small child was found beneath the present tombstone there are many incidents in the story which tend to throw doubt upon it and the existence of similar stories in england and elsewhere points to their origin in the fanatical hatred of the jews of the middle ages and the common superstition now wholly discredited that ritual murder was a factor of jewish paschal rites attempts were made as early as the 13th century by the church to protect the jews against the hatred of the populace and against this particular accusation
6767279 that he st hugh was done to death by jews for ritual purposes cannot be other than a libel based upon the prejudices and ignorance of an unenlightened age
6767280 it was quite obviously one of the very many cases of slander spread about the jews from time to time no doubt the child died or fell down the well
6767281 they the jews crucify a child at lincoln for which eighteen are hanged
6767282 for the death of this child nearly all the jews in england had come together and every town had sent deputies to assist in the sacrifice
6767283 they the jews crucify a child at northampton for which fifty are drawn at horses tails and hanged
6767284 it has also been pointed out that the blood accusation was as a rule made at a time at which the royal treasury needed replenishing
6767285 henceforth and especially under the zealously christian edward i the crown and its officers became almost a worse peril to the jews than mobs intent on loot and led on by fanatic priests and knightly spendthrifts who had borrowed jewish money when 18th century writers of history began to examine the old records in a new sceptical temper some may be found venturing on such unkind surmises as that the alleged crucifixions of christian children only seemed to happen when kings were short of money
6767286 it is difficult to refuse all credit to stories so circumstantial and so frequent
6767287 if rulers think they harm their souls by taking money from usurers
6767288 they should see that the jews are compelled to labour
6767289 ought to cry unto moses by whose conduct their fathers passed through the red sea
6767290 although edward is 1290 edict of expulsion was not formally revoked as manasseh ben israel had hoped the resumption of open jewish worship achieved the same practical result the edict has actually not been revoked to this day
6767291 i watched the first half and then stopped watching because i felt the game was over
6767292 chelsea will be one of the super candidates to fight for the title but i feel we have enough to fight with them
6767293 there was not one factor why we fell away last season it was a conjunction of a few things like injuries some bad luck as well as a bit of inexperience and nervousness
6767294 we have a short squad yes and we cannot afford 10 injuries like other teams with big numbers
6767295 but i think we have the right number of players who can compete at the top level when everyone is fit
6767296 that is not the case at the moment but through the season we should get guys like diaby rosicky and eduardo back
6767297 we know the success of our season is based on how quickly we can focus again on club targets after international games
6767298 fulham have a strong squad and their team look more dangerous going forwards than they did last year

6767350 back when my family faced this disease information and support were almost non existent while my family had nowhere to turn its important for todays caregivers to recognize that medical treatment educational information resources and support organizations are available to help
6767351 i want other families to understand how important it is not to go it alone
6767352 on one hand education empowers caregivers and eases some of the practical burden of the disease on the other hand the afa quilt to remember enables families to creatively express their feelings about their loved ones and alleviate some of the emotional toll

6767363 if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched mr ayers was a leader of the weather underground a terrorist group responsible for countless bombings against targets including the u s capitol the pentagon and numerous police stations courthouses and banks

6767389 i had weatherstaff for the race when it was meant to be at york but i wasnt happy with him
6767390 this horse is so highly rated i started thinking about running in the prix morny but then i felt if hes good enough for that hes good enough for the gimcrack
6767391 he may well go up to seven furlongs now as i feel that could be his best trip he is in the champagne stakes at doncaster
6767392 the detention of the yemeni christians not only violates their human rights but also exposes them for further human rights violations like torture and even extrajudicial killings
6767393 yemeni authorities should fulfill their obligations under international human rights law by releasing the christians and respecting the freedom of their citizens to follow the religion of their choice
6767394 an unidentified yemeni authority admitted that his country had detained nine christian converts from islam between may and august 2008 icc has obtained the names of several of the detained christians but for their safety at this time we cannot reveal their names
6767395 our sources indicated that the christians were detained by the political security office which is headed by colonel ghaleb al qamish
6767396 the political security office is infamous for carrying out extrajudicial killings torture and other forms of egregious human rights violations with impunity the imprisoned christians are also feared to be experiencing torture and even facing death
6767397 help us to shine the light on the yemeni secret police
6767398 according to the yemeni news website sahwa net the christians are charged with promoting to christianity and distributing the bible sic the paper does not clarify if the christians were formally charged in a court of law based on those allegations
6767399 christians in iran egypt and algeria have seen a spike in anti christian activity this recent imprisonment of christians in yemen is part of a growing persecution of christians in islamic countries
6767400 i have been waiting for the oakland county prosecutor to do exactly this for six months

6767408 nicole plays guitar and deejays we are very musical and try to show this while on stage our vibe isnt like your typical group because nicole deejays shes able to command the crowd and every once and a while well bring the guitar out on stage to show our versatility
6767409 were so excited about the music weve recorded for this album weve grown so much in the last few years and experienced love heartbreak fun times sad times and everything in between the content on the musical is really reflective of our personal experiences
6767410 were giving our fans a glimpse into our lives as nicole and natalie also the production on this album is extremely tight we worked with some of the most talented writers and producers in the industry the album is a pop r amp b album with a hip hop base its very true to who we are and is finely crafted we cant wait to release it
6767411 we grew up in a household where music was always played our dad deejayed from sunrise to sunset its because of him that we learned to appreciate all genres of music and have always been open to experimenting with different sounds and vibes
6767412 when we auditioned for cipha we didnt know what to expect but he embraced our performance and soon after asked us to hit the studio with him
6767413 at our first session he played us the coolie dance riddim and within 30 minutes of hearing it and vibing out wed written
6767414 we had no idea what would come of it but he kept saying the song was gonna be big same way he believed in us we believed in him and the song took off
6767415 when we were signed to universal records we always felt disconnected they didnt understand us as a group and didnt give us the proper attention a label should give any artist they are trying to propel to success
6767416 after our last situation ended we knew it was important to sign with someone who believed in us our movement and our music from the beginning bryan leach got it it was as if he was a part of our team even prior to signing to his label
6767417 theyre a lot smaller than your traditional tank storage water heater so you save on space
6767418 as you turn on the hot water faucet as water runs through it thats when it heats the water itll never heat water until water is actually running through the system
6767419 is they heat water and then re heat and re heat and re heat
6767420 youre going to pay it off in probably five years
6767421 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6767422 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6767423 because extractions of wisdom teeth are commonly operated in dental clinics we can expect a lot of donors of stem cells
6767424 that enable us to create stem cells of various genetic codes eliminating the risk that a body of a patient would reject transplanted tissues or organs

6767434 leaders and communities in these pivotal states and in other states at risk in the sahel horn of africa and in southeast asia are already facing enormous political social demographic economic and security challenges
6767435 climate change will greatly complicate and could undermine efforts to manage these challenges
6767436 we must avoid relying exclusively on quick fixes like food aid that are necessary but do not address the underlying causes of the emergency and most importantly we ought to help people get back on their feet as soon as possible after the disaster has been tackled

6767439 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6767440 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6767441 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6767442 what you should know about politics but dont a nonpartisan guide to the issues
6767443 as my mom used to say were from north dakota everybody gets to be something for a while as long as you bring a hotdish
6767444 to fill a void the existence of which has been made all the more apparent by myriad mudslinging volumes in the ann coulter michael moore mold that have more to do with misplaced hate than thoughtful contemplation of the issues ahead
6767445 i had studied islamic art middle eastern history and arabic in college and i was shocked by how little even the media knew about the issues they were covering
6767446 in another era i probably would have been a rockefeller republican
6767447 i loathe the entrenched political machines of both parties which i think are dangerous and far too often misleading manipulative and fundamentally dishonest so in that sense you might say im a populist
6767448 the economy creates strange political bedfellows and reflects major ideological shifts for one thing policies such as deficit spending and economic intervention advocated by democrats and strongly opposed by republicans in the early twentieth century eventually caught on so that by the 1960s republicans supported some formerly liberal economic ideas however conservative views about managing the deficit and debt that were touted by republicans during the 80s are now more commonly held by democrats

6767455 is the oldest grain elevator in the city it was built 100 years ago in 1908 and really personifies what the grain industry meant to the development of minneapolis
6767456 its one of the first grain elevators made of reinforced concrete built in country and is still going strong
6767457 theres a lot of interesting aspects to this neighborhood and one of them is that the housing comes right up next to the elevators
6767458 the question were really going to have to address is how do you balance the jobs that are there now with the ones were trying to create there for the future
6767459 we want to know whats really unique about this corridor and without that knowledge of its history we wont be able to really figure out what makes it tick as a community
6767460 who settled here why did they come we dont want to be acquiring properties without regard to their history
6767461 what people are interested in when it comes to something like the community works plan is what kinds of housing products will happen in the corridor
6767462 the elevators are industrial and their size is so gigantic most people here tend to see them in the context of how they block the views
6767463 oem manufacturers relocating or opening new facilities in the prc
6767464 further our initial outreach to certain potential international customers has indicated strong interest in our products our agency agreement with koreas project development amp consultation co ltd to market our products to south korean companies is also expected to contribute to our growing international sales we plan to align ourselves with industry experts to co develop and launch the next generation battery components we believe the confluence of these factors will create substantial new market opportunities to improve our sales and continue our earnings momentum through the new fiscal year

6767466 i want to know what makes my little nephew tick
6767467 in the last four years or five years we used movies in our experiments
6767468 but we used movies basically to understand about the brain
6767469 you can think about it as control by the director
6767470 hitchcock managed to take each main area and cause it to respond in a similar way so he basically controlled whats going on in the brain
6767471 you can think of it as real life or the most boring movie ever
6767472 they like to leave things open ended and ambiguous for different kinds of feelings so if director sees a strong correlation maybe he or she thinks they failed
6767473 but then if you think about other movies they dont leave anything open they want to control as much of the brain as possible
6767474 you can go to the area that processes the soundtrack see any correlations and then go to the lighting and then the plot and so forth
6767475 were up on the research aspects of fmri but we decided that its not a viable technology for neuromarketing
6767476 we bring people into the laboratory depending on whichever demographic a company wants examined
6767477 we show them material we wire them up we put electrodes on their head and we precisely measure where their eyes are looking their galvanic skin response and their heart rate
6767478 if were analyzing a two hour movie we can extract the most salient parts for a trailer automatically
6767479 the most salient parts fit together into a very nice story
6767480 when people are consuming an experience together theres a form of emotional contagion
6767481 the next thing is were building a small movie theater
6767482 the crowd effect is going to be important for certain things were definitely moving in that direction
6767483 with the market and the companies that approached me the clients simply dont care if its reliable or not

6767485 people we work with keep asking us to look at things at an earlier creative stage
6767486 the ability of the diazem process to enable the profitable recovery of copper and lead from the ore at la tapata will add a new positive dimension to geminis financial picture we are looking forward to completing the build out of la tapatas processing plant and putting this project into full production

6767492 there is little time left to get a solid negotiating text on the table clearly the clock is ticking
6767493 we feel extremely uncomfortable with the kind of sectoral approaches that are being discussed
6767494 the inclusion of forests in carbon markets enables developed countries to avoid real carbon emissions reductions at home
6767495 trigger a rapid increase in land rights abuses due to a rapid expansion of state and or corporate control over forests without regard for the customary or territorial rights of indigenous peoples and other forest dependent communities
6767496 these negotiations on the means that may be available to annex i parties to reach their emission reduction targets are expected to be concluded in accra thus laying the groundwork for parties to move on to negotiate emission reduction ranges in poznan in december
6767497 we know that todays home buyers are more knowledgeable about the process in general and have higher expectations of information provided regarding the homes in which they are interested
6767498 what this survey provides with its in depth demographic analysis is a map to better serving that end consumer
6767499 by providing realtors r with this breadth of information as well as a marketing platform to meet the consumer needs we believe we are providing a valuable solution to the real estate industry

6767509 kid someday all this making sausages at the minnesota state fair will be yours
6767510 i said put yer thumb on the scale not your whole arm ya idiot
6767511 the year was 1947 and big sleeves ear pencils and piles of sausage were all the rage
6767512 the staring contest by the bratwurst scale was a top fair attraction until the rock paper scissors invitational in the pig barn captured minnesotans hearts
6767513 that was my fathers behind the ear pencil and now its yours

6767515 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6767516 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message
6767517 she made up to 500 a time for an overnight girlfriend experience
6767518 smiling and shaking hands with a prospective customer are easy things to do that should be delivered 100 percent of the time
6767519 overlooking these simple gestures conveys a lack of respect for the customer or disinterest in their business and can destroy the foundation of a relationship before its even started
6767520 ideally a new account representative should assess customer needs and offer several product options before making a recommendation which occurs at 64 percent of banks
6767521 however 20 percent of representatives only offer one option and 16 percent give options without providing a recommendation which indicates that some banks fail to provide prospective customers with important information and guidance for establishing new accounts
6767522 not seizing the opportunity to invite shoppers to become customers can cause banks to lose business
6767523 ultimately you have to ask for the business to close the sale

6767529 the empire for many people was the major sense of their existence now its no more
6767530 it was regarded as poor retarded you know just underdeveloped and so on
6767531 now under mr putin russia has finally emerged as a more or less well to do nation but it wanted to have the feeling that now it will be regarded by the other nations differently with more respect
6767532 washington has been neglecting the relationship with russia profoundly over the last eight years
6767533 weve had a situation time and time again when president bush has gone to a summit meeting you know declared his cooperation with his good friend president putin and then hes gone back to washington and nothing has happened
6767534 why for 15 years after the end of cold war west did do very little to make russia an ally and friend
6767535 every russian leader came to power saying reasonable things about the west and sooner or later something happens which will turn them anti american
6767536 i talk to my friends they basically say america is extremely selfish country and doesnt understand that other people may have different ideas different agendas different approaches
6767537 they do not trust that this effort undertaken by the u s in europe is against iran or against terrorist launches
6767538 they still think that this is against russia why what is the reason that instead of inviting both nations to cooperate closely they fight each other on that
6767539 all of them are in a stupor because they dont know what to say they dont want to speak out and support russia but on the other hand they dont want to come out and oppose russia
6767540 it is still uncertain when or if the treasury will inject capital into fannie and any effect on current holders has not been specified

6767544 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
6767545 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion litres of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
6767546 i was very surprised with the high numbers but it catches everybodys attention
6767547 so there is a distribution problem but this also reflects the maldistribution of water
6767548 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry
6767549 uk water footprint the impact of the uks food and fibre consumption on global water resources
6767550 only 38 percent of uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
6767551 therefore it is essential that business and government identify the areas that could potentially suffer water crises and develop solutions so the environment is not over exploited to the point that people and wildlife lose out

6767588 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6767589 we can only hope that the foreign secretary will now reflect on this judgment and provide direct assistance to binyams defence team
6767590 we have never contested that mr mohameds defence lawyers should have access to information which would assist him in his defence in any trial at guantanamo bay
6767591 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6767592 it is a basic and long established value in any democracy that the location of those in custody is made known to the detainees family and those representing him

6767630 many of these vulnerabilities represent practical threats to the integrity of elections as they are conducted in ohio
6767631 we found vulnerabilities in different vendor systems that would for example allow voters and poll workers to place multiple votes to infect the precinct with virus software or to corrupt previously cast votes sometimes irrevocably
6767632 none of the systems out there are even remotely adequate given the importance of the data they handle

6767803 we were both scared when the geogia thing started but then i decided to just go for it
6767804 but at first it was only twice a week i think
6767805 i have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others lives
6767806 the nsg should reject this ill considered unwise and unproductive plan
6767807 if you talk to warren hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
6767808 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
6767809 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth and i also think you want to instill that sense of self reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes
6767810 i work full time but food gas everything has just gone through the roof
6767811 its horrible congress is on vacation and theyre probably soaking up the rays somewhere were soaking up high gas prices
6767812 more travelers concerned about the economy gasoline prices and rising airfares are opting to travel by train bus motorcycle and cruise ship to their holiday weekend destinations
6767813 nobody has enough gas money to fill up the truck so were not going anymore
6767814 its too expensive theres not enough money to rent a house like we normally do
6767815 some of my buddies couldnt afford it this year it just costs too much
6767816 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and business travelers are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all
6767817 new yorkers have been bucking the trend that weve seen in the rest of the country

6767823 logan had a little bit of a setback injury wise
6767824 i think hes back on course he was impressive in training camp this kid is a smart hockey player
6767825 the way things go in this league i never say never we have a pretty experienced team so it would probably lean towards sending him back to juniors but you still want people coming to camp believing they can make the team
6767826 hes been a kid that every time weve had people in to see him hes been involved in a lot of plays
6767827 hes not a player who worries about statistics he does what the team needs you get excited about people who have adaptable skills hell be able to make a team and then be able to stay on a team his numbers were good in college they probably could have been better but hes not that kind of a player with guys like steve you never have to worry about him going in a scoring drought for a week even if theyre not scoring theyre still going to be important players
6767828 justin is 6 2 and drew is 6 1 these kids have really shot up in the last year
6767829 these were the best players in that area and they really grew a lot theyre pretty good players the course that theyre taking the guys who have taken this course because they needed to add some weight and have success at each level its worked out better
6767830 a hard nosed winger who stays around the front of the net he gives you some physical grit but he can play with skilled players he can stay in front of the net on the power play and he wont move hes also not a bad penalty killer its hard to find left wings in this business
6767831 i think whats happened is that the coaches in the minors have spent a lot of time with him on his defensive game and maybe its taken away a little bit of his creativity
6767832 hes a big kid and hes making good progress hes going to spend at least another year at boston college well go year by year and see how it goes
6767833 hell be in worcester starting out but we think hes close to being able to play some games here the kid is a pretty good player hes a good offensive player but hes got a little bit of bite to him too
6767834 hes got to play more if he was with a lot of other teams maybe he gets 30 games its a little different here
6767835 hes really close i think the group we have coming underneath its a real good group we had a lot of people calling about our young goalies
6767836 hes on the world junior tryout roster so hopefully that will be another step forward for him

6767842 we do not recognize a country called israel and so we cannot recognize a nation called israel
6767843 though the resolution was supposedly aimed only at secular zionism the slander is an attack on the entire jewish people
6767844 we agudath israel adherents would feel precisely the same responsibility to come to the defense of our brethren while we may have our own quarrel with secular zionism when jews are libeled their affiliation does not matter our love for our brothers and sisters draws us to their side

6767899 brands hatch ist ein kurs mit gro er tradition und auch wegen seiner einzigartigen charakteristik samt gro er h henunterschiede ein highlight im kalender mit nicht einmal zwei kilometern ist es zwar die k rzeste strecke des jahres aber dennoch eine sehr schwierige

6767937 our team is young so its sure that our next objective is london 2012
6767938 it was really close i was right there but at the end i think i lacked a bit of energy and strength mostly and i was so close
6767939 its a start but im very competitive when i want something i usually get it so im disappointed because i wanted my gold medal and it wasnt because i couldnt get it it was right there it was just a question of training and a few other things maybe next time

6767953 a bright fall day like this and i want to sing
6767954 but scaring parents away from life saving medicines is no way to improve this terrible situation i have met parents who lost their children to vaccine preventable diseases and they are haunted if you had your way there would be far more of these haunted souls i hope to prevent that from happening
6767955 five major studies have found no link and since thimerosals removal from all routinely administered childhood vaccines in 2001 there has been no apparent effect on autism rates
6767956 many of our members have a family member or have suffered themselves from vaccine reactions
6767957 one sized fits all vaccine mandates regardless of the causalties
6767958 as journalists we treat our readers viewers listeners and online users as fairly and openly as possible whatever the medium we tell our audiences the complete unvarnished truth as best we can learn it
6767959 what can we do to reward this fine man for his excellent work on our behalf i know well name our newest most expensive vaccine after him well call it gardinerharrisil
6767960 one reason they dont have only thimerosal free flu vaccines on the market
6767961 introducing the american academy of pediatrics new two wrongs make a right policy
6767962 if the past is any guide some 4 or 5 million thimerosal free flu doses will be discarded because they went unused right
6767963 conditions that lead them to regress simultaneously with vaccination but not as a result of vaccination
6767964 why is it necessary for the media to have a watchdog
6767965 quite frankly the news media dont always get their stories right whats worse many of them dont even seem to care by advising them of their responsibility to the public whom they claim to serve aim helps to nudge the members of the news media into greater accountability for their actions
6767966 scientists including government ones and the ones i know are working as hard as they can to figure out why
6767967 whats the production of pediatric thimerosal free vaccines this year something like 19 million doses and of those if the past is any guide some 4 or 5 million will be discarded because they went unused right further the cdc estimates that flu vaccine coverage in young children is on the order of 20 or 25 percent or so right so who are all these children who are getting adult thimerosal containing flu vaccines
6767968 its heart breaking but scaring parents away from life saving medicines is no way to improve this terrible situation i have met parents who lost their children to vaccine preventable diseases and they are haunted if you had your way there would be far more of these haunted souls i hope to prevent that from happening
6767969 yeah give my child some mercury because i cant miss work

6767971 were very pleased to see one more tool that we can use to have whats a nutritious good product become even safer
6767972 were hearing on the order of three to five cents per pound which is not all that much to guarantee safety
6767973 it will be a business decision basically to see if customers are willing to purchase this or not
6767974 i see this probably starting off small to see how consumers will react to it and then perhaps grow to some point
6767975 may not be the futuristic cure all the fda is looking for
6767976 we still think that good agricultural practices good sanitation practices good manufacturing practices are all absolutely essential and actually should be mandated in addition to providing for this choice of irradiation

6768049 he wasnt as smooth and relaxed as many of the others
6768050 he couldnt get into his rhythm and it preyed on his mind but hell back he trained so hard for this he hasnt even eaten a biscuit in months
6768051 we train in groups because it makes things a hell of a lot easier and never use ipods because you lose focus on your walk

6768065 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6768066 because brown fat cells burn calories the scientists theorized that finding ways to encourage the development of brown fat might be good for treating obesity in previous research the scientists were among the first to develop cell lines of precursor cells that give rise to brown fat cells we used those cell lines to study how insulin affects the conversion of fat precursors or preadipocytes into mature brown adipocytes said dr tseng

6768091 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna
6768092 but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market
6768093 her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it

6768096 while the huge opportunities generated by the mining boom in central and north western queensland are well known we shouldnt take our eye off the ball as cairns could also benefit heavily
6768097 one of the big winners is set to be cairns aviation sector providing fly in fly out operations for miners living in cairns transporting on site workers on r amp r and providing training services for the large and diverse workforce
6768098 regional aviation services are vital to growing the regions ability to service the mining sector both in australia and internationally
6768099 currently there is a weekly capacity of approximately 4 000 seats for servicing mining centres equating to over 200 000 seats a year
6768100 this is expected to rise as more projects come on line
6768101 aviation is also an industry earmarked for development through the state governments centres of enterprise initiative here in the far north which means we are putting the work in now to make the most of these types of opportunities
6768102 cairns is the perfect base to provide a workforce across the region with our fantastic climate and lifestyle relatively affordable housing and everything you could want in a major metropolitan centre in the tropics
6768103 we are a closer source of supply to the darwin and the kimberleys areas than other major centres including perth and were also in the perfect position to generate business from mining operations in png and eastern indonesia
6768104 in fact proposals for two major png projects near port moresby alone are talking about an expatriate construction workforce need peaking towards 10 000
6768105 in the past our workforce strengths have been in areas such as tourism fishing and agriculture
6768106 growing the education sector is a particularly beneficial opportunity for diversifying the regional economy
6768107 here is an opportunity to not only attract workers to the region but also to develop and promote our potential mining workforce and suppliers particularly when we know in the past that png mining companies have sent workers to melbourne for training when were right on their doorstep
6768108 i certainly support industry efforts already underway in this area
6768109 i thank the cairns chamber for commerce for their consistent efforts in realising the potential mining opportunities in the region

6768117 im delighted by the progress main roads had made with the bridgework component of this project despite 1 4 metres of rain falling on site since december
6768118 to complete the widening and refurbishment of the existing bridge four months ahead of schedule reflects the dedication of main roads and the project team of ghd and jf hull holdings
6768119 its quite appropriate that traffic will begin flowing across both bridges this week as it has been an olympic like effort to get to this point
6768120 by completing the bridgework so early and switching traffic project staff are now in a position to finalise the approaches to the bridges earlier than expected
6768121 when the project is finished later in 2008 motorists will enjoy significantly improved traffic flow and travel time savings as well as the safety benefits that come from a less congested road
6768122 i note the sister project the 85 million pacific paradise bypass is also progressing well and will be completed early next year
6768123 this project will improve safety and reduce congestion by taking traffic away from the centre of pacific paradise it will also significantly improve access to the busy sunshine coast airport
6768124 we are working together as partners to make certain that we cover the concerns of both parties for the sovereignty of the iraqi government
6768125 were talking about an agreement that is going to build a firm foundation for building on the significant success that weve had together in the last year and it gives more and more responsibility to iraqi forces
6768126 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification
6768127 the goal that both the united states and iraq have is that iraqi security forces are able to take more of the lead in combat missions and the united states forces can move into an overwatch role
6768128 you could have had jp 8 in there and i wouldnt have known the difference
6768129 the concept of institutional competencies took root at the office of secretary of defense level and continues to gain momentum as we address expectations of the department of defenses 21st century leaders
6768130 were taking proactive steps to address deliberate development of our airmens career lifecycle as we begin with institutional competencies this committee will provide oversight of the content of all institutional competency programs
6768131 the speed at which the force management and development council leadership provided direction and the expectations for these important bodies is a testament that the air force is serious about deliberate development of our airmen and posturing them to meet the challenges we face today and missions we taken on tomorrow

6768140 for the next nine days my team and i will work hard to ensure we provide the best medical care we can for the citizens of the communities we will visit
6768141 its very good the american doctors have come to help
6768142 being the first day it was challenging for us as we got settled in
6768143 but we quickly developed a routine and were able to treat a lot of people in a short amount of time which is what we set out to do
6768144 the guatemalan military provided security for our folks while the guatemalan department of public health ensured we had providers from the country augmenting our team
6768145 but it was the airmen from the 163rd reconnaissance wing serving as liaisons and translators and 163rd medical group who ensured the first day was successful i really think we made a difference for the people of this community and i am looking forward to similar results as we move to the other sites throughout our time here

6768151 as long as the fleet is here there will be no problems i suspect people in the ukrainian government do not understand the meaning of the fleet for sevastopol
6768152 the black sea fleet will be in sevastopol after 2017 and sevastopol will not allow any provocation from the ukrainian government this will serve the interests of ukraine and russia
6768153 the overwhelming majority of people in sevastopol would like to have russian citizenship to be nearer russia and to be protected by the russians
6768154 the massive form of twisting geometric shapes and colours attracts just about everyone who sees it it is visually interesting and it becomes the centrepiece for meeting and conversation but that is not at the expense of the function of bloqx because of this harmony between form and function bloqx has initially been one of the most popular products we have ever shown to architects
6768155 when you reach the top it is the place to see and be seen and meet new friends

6768188 we focused on raising awareness of the great firewall of china the state sponsored information filtering apparatus that monitors and controls e mails and web sites within china
6768189 the great firewall is a tool used by the chinese government to stifle grassroots dissent and prevent the freedoms of speech and press u s corporations play a roll in aiding and abetting the implementation of the great firewall of china though the issue is complex it requires substantially more public discussion on how u s information technology is being used to deny 1 3 billion people fundamental rights

6768278 what i can do is do a courtesy exchange but it wont happen again cause there is not an issue with 3g
6768279 using the iphone on a network it is not designed for may break the iphone
6768280 oh no sir we inform all our customers before we sell them the 3g iphone
6768281 well no one informed me i wouldnt have bought one had i known but i guess thats the plan wouldnt sell as many phones if people knew the truth lying by omission is still lying
6768282 as much as the chip may be the chief problem glitches may also stem from apples software or the at amp t network part of the role of the infineon chip is to check whether theres enough 3g bandwidth available in a given area if 3g isnt available or there isnt enough bandwidth the iphone will be shifted to a slower network one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available according to this person the problems are only occurring in areas of high iphone density these include the san francisco bay area boston and certain overseas locales the reason the problem has gotten worse in recent days is because of the steep increase in iphone activations in these places the more people who are trying to use a given piece of gear the more likely they are to get bumped
6768283 im having the same problem and i live in the pocket area of sacramento i called att and they told me it was not the phone but the 3g network it would be interesting to have other 3g phones in the same exact area and see if they are also having the same problem if the other phones are having the problem then its the network 3g if not then it has to be the 3g i phone so lets see how long it will take this issue to be resolved so we may enjoy our i phones
6768284 i can happily report that ever since we have done the sim swap routine we now have three working iphone 3gs
6768285 any idea why my service wouldnt have 5 bars one mile from a tower
6768286 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver
6768287 what i was told was that 90 of the disconnects are initiated inside the phone which would exonerate at amp t
6768288 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver
6768289 apple released a patch we dont know if it works or not
6768290 heres an example iphone 1 no service iphone 2 106 dbm iphone 3 103 dbm iphone 4 no service iphone 5 106 dbm swisscom field test equipment nokia 3g transceiver 72 dbm swisscom field test equipment samsung 3g receiver 74 dbm swisscom field test equipment s e 3g receiver 76 dbm swisscom usb 3g stick hp notebook 71 dbm swisscom pc card dell notebook 79 dbm
6768291 the problem is affecting 2 to 3 of iphone traffic the people say that compares with a dropped call rate of around 1 for all traffic for at amp t
6768292 further to our telephone conversation on 20th august 2008 i can confirm that a case has been raised with apple with regards to the signal and service issues with their new 3g iphones apple have advised that they are presently working on a fix for this issue and hope to have resolved with the latest software updates
6768293 look we know there is a global problem going on were working on it
6768294 what i didnt hear you iphone iphone are you there
6768295 safari cant open the page because it could not connect to the server
6768296 hey this 3g connection ill search for non 3g reception
6768297 sitting here with an iphone and a nokia n80 side by side both on o2 zero or occassionally 1 bar on 3g network for the iphone 101db compared to the full seven or so bars on the n80
6768298 bars are not an indication of how strong the signal is
6768299 just arent a good indicator of where your signal strength is
6768300 yeah theres a chance that some of the first batch could have some reception issues just like any product

6768373 if a client has 5 000 to spend on advertising they can either buy one page advertisement in the local paper or they can buy 5 000 writing instruments unlike the newspaper ad which will only appear in one edition the pens will be passed from user to user allowing the decorated message to live on for years to come to think of the number of people who see or use just one of those pens is staggering if as consumers we look in our desks in our purses or next to our home telephones well find a pen with someone elses name on it theres no reason it cant be your name on that pen

6768535 dear family friends fans and public i did not use the steroid boldenone or any other steroid of prohibited substance
6768536 my friends antonio is one of the hardest working most serious athletes i know he also is a man that holds high his principles we dont know at this point how he tested positive for a horse steroid but what we do know is that he doesnt make use of these kind of products however we will find out or die trying we are always reading about guys getting caught and declaring their innocence and it is always met with a degree of skepticism but the truth is that career hurting mistakes are being made and it is high time the we find out how and why they happen we are extremely sure of ourselves in this matter and are willing to go to the very gates of hell to prove that we are being wronged hopefully this will not only clear antonio but also help clear other peolple that have had the same thing happen to them
6768537 we respect the california commission and the job they do we always enjoy working with them and work very well together the illegal use of steroids is a problem in all major sports including mixed martial arts we certainly do not condone the use of steroids
6768538 but we also support trust and have confidence in our fighter antonio silva who has denied ever taken any illegal substance including steroids and is prepared to challenge the results of the california commission
6768539 so until all the facts are known and a final decision is rendered elitexc will reserve making any further comments at this time

6768549 elections rarely turn now on deep meaning or intercontinental ballistic missile treaties or even or war and peace they turn on symbolism and john mccain just fell into a big giant steaming pile of symbolism
6768550 this puzzled me i was confused as to what he meant then there was another interview where somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong but if youre like me and you got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america you dont have to be a nobel prize laureate economist you just have to have a little bit of a sense of what ordinary people are going through to understand that we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the failed economic policies that george bush has put in place

6768599 have the content owners gone completely mad are they actually trying to destroy our love of music
6768600 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
6768601 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined
6768602 by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
6768603 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
6768604 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
6768605 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
6768606 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
6768607 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
6768608 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
6768609 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
6768610 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
6768611 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
6768612 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
6768613 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
6768614 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
6768615 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
6768616 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
6768617 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

6768644 the thing hasnt moved more than 20 or 30 miles all day
6768645 one model shows it moving 30 to 40 miles in the next 48 hours
6768646 people who have lived through one storm here know what to expect
6768647 if theyre new to the area they should talk to their neighbors its not just a matter of where you are its the design of your home you may not be in a low lying area but if your garage door sits at the bottom of a hill you may still get water coming under your door its important to assess your personal situation and not just rely on whether or not youre in a low lying area
6768648 and there are isolated places throughout the county where its going to feel like youre walking on a wet sponge
6768649 we keep waiting for it to make a turn to the west but it could be a little bit before it actually makes that move
6768650 obviously its not got to be a very fun day tomorrow
6768651 it makes no sense to count civilian casualties in a war zone as deaths caused by terrorism mr zakaria wrote since the mid 1990s thousands of civilians have been killed in war zones in other countries around the world and those victims werent counted as casualties related to terrorism
6768652 obviously the war didnt fuel extremist views in muslim countries
6768653 when i pulled up a crowd of people surrounded the car and stared as if they were seeing extraterrestrial beings
6768654 instead of focusing on the burn victims the nurses kept repeating you drove them here
6768655 my daughter took the right decision at the right time
6768656 wow thats different she gets my attention as i so often think to myself when looking at other like minded fashion mavericks
6768657 oh god what was i thinking that day in may 2008 at the hair salon
6768658 basing your self esteem on your appearance is shallow and damaging
6768659 we want aioli dont forget aioli a bucket of aioli no make that two buckets
6768660 im too cheap to invest in something newer and cooler
6768661 resumed his normal schedule of performing in six shows a day for marine park crowds every day of the week
6768662 the first ever seaworld swimmer to be raised in captivity by foster swimmers mark spitz and dara torres

6768664 aah ive been through that nonsense before i wont be fooled again i now have enough rope protective plastic covering devices soft rags and knot tying experience to make macgyver look like a fool a damn fool
6768665 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6768666 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6768667 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6768668 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6768669 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6768670 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6768671 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6768672 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6768673 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6768674 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6768675 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6768676 if you trust every web site but not a government
6768677 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6768678 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6768679 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6768680 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6768681 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6768682 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6768683 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6768808 the collins hemi 1 well is exhibiting all the characteristics of being a discovery well located on the southern flanks of the cherry creek trend which appears to extend 4 to 10 miles north by northwest of this well additionally it appears this well and our surrounding lease acreage maybe positioned on an anticlinal fault trapping mechanism we have discovered significant amounts of natural gas present in this field and are currently negotiating a market for this gas once we have established a market for this gas shareholders should expect to see a dramatic increase in the oil and gas production over the choked back production numbers we currently are producing upon establishing a market for this natural gas we will aggressively continue drilling and development of collins and other undeveloped lease acreage we have located along this trend in a southeast to a northwestern pattern i would like to acknowledge we have taken more time than usual to complete this well we have experienced weather delays and with the discovery of additional coal bed methane and conventional oil and gas pay horizons present in this well we chose the side of caution and await lab and engineering analysis results before completing this well and putting it into production

6768845 two voting machine companies es amp s and diebold electronically counted 80 percent of the votes in the 2004 presidential election both companies have extensive ties to the republican party
6768846 a respected voting expert with the consulting firm election data services
6768847 counted approximately 56 of the vote in each of the last four presidential and congressional elections
6768848 when you say that 80 of the votes in 2004 were counted by diebold and es amp s i think that is actually a conservative figure you have to remember that its not just the voting machines with secret software that count our votes its also the central tabulators where the final counting is done and these central tabulators are also owned by private companies like diebold and es amp s
6768849 the united states is one of only a handful of major democracies that allow private partisan companies to secretly count and tabulate votes using their own proprietary software today eighty percent of all the ballots in america are tallied by four companies diebold election systems amp software es amp s sequoia voting systems and hart intercivic

6768863 former gov mitt romney of massachusetts and gov tim pawlenty of minnesota are the top candidates as mr mccain and his advisers gather over the next several days at mr mccains cabin near sedona they said
6768864 2 republican sources say mccain has apparently settled on romney as his pick but no offer has been made
6768865 mccain supporters attribute the campaigns summertime transformation which has been accompanied by small but steady gains in polls to a more direct and disciplined operation thanks in part to the newly promoted steve schmidt an unapologetically ruthless veteran of the 2004 bush campaign
6768866 since then however new focus is evident in a campaign that previously reflected mccains instinct for improvisation public appearances been more ambitiously conceived and staged the candidate and surrogates have been given instructions not only what to say but also what not to do each day according to a campaign adviser even the luggage handling is smoother those who travel with mccain say
6768867 bushs third term has become a favorite attack line for democrats repeated almost daily by the candidate and his surrogates they argue that mccain favors failed bush administration economic policies and would keep u s troops in iraq for the foreseeable future
6768868 although he almost always supported bushs positions in congress mccain has done his best on the campaign trail to shun the widely unpopular republican president whose job approval rating sunk to a record low 28 percent in ap ipsos polls in april and july so far mccains strategy hasnt convinced the public
6768869 why is it a real race now with john mccain rising in the polls and barack obama falling there are many answers but here i think is an essential one the american people have begun paying attention its hard for our political class to remember that mr obama has been famous in america only since the winter of 08 america met him barely six months ago the political class first interviewed him or read the interview in 2003 or 04 when he was a rising star they know him everyone else is still absorbing
6768870 this is what they see an attractive intelligent man interesting hard to categorize
6768871 and over there is mr mccain and well we know him hes pow senator prickly irritating john mccain
6768872 this is what they see an attractive intelligent man interesting hard to categorize is he gen obama no no military background brilliant businessman obama no he never worked in business famous name obama no its a new name an unusual one longtime southern governor obama no hes a community organizer whats that then a lawyer boo then a state legislator so what sos my cousin then u s senator less than four years and over there is mr mccain and well we know him hes pow senator prickly irritating john mccain
6768873 inability to recall the number of homes he owns during an interview yesterday jeopardized his campaigns carefully constructed strategy to frame democratic rival barack obama as an out of touch elitist and inspired a round of attacks that once again ratcheted up the negative tone of the race for the white house
6768874 for a democratic candidate suffering from a barrage of attacks on his celebrity mccains inability to recall the scope of his family holdings was a timely break
6768875 for democrats the kerfuffle carried a clear whiff of payback
6768876 barack obama knows a lot about housing problems one of his biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion purchasing part of the property he couldnt afford
6768877 john mccains family owns at least eight properties not the seven democrats are alleging or the four mccains staff identified according to a politico analysis of property and tax records as well as interviews the presumptive republican nominee though may have some wiggle room in explaining why he couldnt immediately provide an answer when asked by politico how many houses he and his wife cindy own sen mccain himself does not own any of the properties theyre all owned by cindy mccain her dependent children and the trusts and companies they control
6768878 the heightened scrutiny on the candidates personal wealth reflects voter anxiety over the still struggling economy the issue has particular resonance as the subprime crisis continues to move through the market forcing a growing number of homeowners into foreclosure the campaigns aware that some of the highest foreclosure rates are in key swing states such as ohio and florida jumped on the issue with a vengeance
6768879 the dnc meanwhile pounces yet again on mccains multiple houses with a web video that contains man on the street interviews with people who all know how many homes they own

6768889 independents women and wayne county voters helped boost democrat barack obama to a 7 point lead over republican john mccain in the presidential race in michigan according to a detroit free press local 4 michigan poll conducted this week obamas 46 to 39 statewide advantage is especially aided by his bulge of 39 percentage points among voters in wayne county including detroit
6768890 still the numbers could move nearly one third 31 of those questioned in the free press local 4 poll said they could be persuaded to change their minds by election day on nov 4

6768892 provides a window into the close relationship between the obamas their associates at the university of chicago and axelrod the strategist most central to barack obamas rise it also illustrates how that circle and particularly michelle dealt with an intractable social problem that confronts many urban areas how much care should large nonprofit hospitals offer the poor in return for tax exempt status

6769036 people around the world were only too aware of the threat posed by nuclear armageddon cold war posturing brinkmanship puffed up military parades wars by proxy and boastful national pride all did their part the public were not aware of the hidden apocalypse science by mutual consent the erstwhile allies of britain france the usa and the ussr kept what they had found in secret german facilities during world war two hidden from view they never mentioned the ongoing underground war conducted throughout the 40s and 50s a war that combated the remnants of wartime madness a war in the shadows they never talked about the frantic attempts to utilise the technology and find out what the other sides had in their arsenal the atom weapons intercontinental bombers and fledgling missile programmes were nothing compared to what could be unleashed by the twisted technology nothing on october 27th 1962 the world ended nobody is clear why or how the cuban missile crisis was in full swing and tension was high but to this day there is no agreement over who fired the first shots who decided to unleash hell most people expected the flash and wind of nuclear weapons most people did not expect the other weapons flotillas of soviet landing ships appeared off the east coast of the uk the waiting troops were never briefed on what might come out of them the country was being peppered by nuclear bombs miraculously london was never suffered a direct hit wireless and telephone reports trickled in from the continent as mushroom clouds rose over berlin warsaw and paris the reports talked of other things of black masses moving across the land of hordes of seemingly unkillable soldiers of holes appearing in the sky then the continent stopped talking waves of static and precious little else the english countryside became a battlefield whatever the landing ships and aircraft unleashed swept down lanes and over dales britain fought back in kind but things started to go wrong command and control started to falter communications broke down discipline started to waver all communications north of newcastle simply stopped then the raf carried out its most controversial mission since dresden someone ordered the crew of a remaining vulcan to drop a yellow sun nuclear bomb on the research facility at porton down thus was born the infamous operation indigo diamond it was later assumed that something had gone horribly terribly wrong at porton the reputation of the raf would be irrevocably damaged from then on now there is only hell and hell is right here

6769043 regulation proposed to help protect health care providers from discrimination

6769045 for years federal law has carefully balanced protections for individual religious liberty and patients access to reproductive health care the proposed regulations appear to take patients health needs out of the equation

6769122 if it werent flat screen tvs it wouldnt have gotten the coverage
6769123 it is a potential problem as the public may begin to neglect the message if they get whipsawed by exaggerated reports
6769124 so we need to state information clearly including appropriate caveats
6769125 it was a very useful study a useful warning too bad it got over hyped
6769126 it is not a message for consumers i e there is no reason for them not to buy flat screens but it is a message for technologists to be aware of its potential effects
6769127 a lot of environmentalists are concerned about being the bearer of bad news and always being seen as the people who want you to do something that would lower their quality of life
6769128 you dont always want to be the one saying i dont want you to buy that
6769129 the thing that drives me mad about this is that we have researchers and nf3 is their claim to fame
6769130 we brag about it we got an epa award for this and now for it to be reported in this way is depressing for the team
6769131 he was called by ats but he didnt go the narco test was not conducted why
6769132 the escape of any other citizen during the course of investigation wouldnt have raised a storm but in this case there was no brouhaha why
6769133 he had a confirmed ticket proving that it was all well planned
6769134 did the us pressurise the indian security agencies in letting him out
6769135 well theres always that possibility that that time will come

6769141 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have august 19 2008
6769142 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector

6769144 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires

6769146 tourists come to the hotel with all the necessary items to stay as if they were staying at the most extreme refuge on earth
6769147 this refuge will offer a mixed programme of reflection and exercise to seize the unique physical conditions encountered in space
6769148 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6769149 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6769150 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6769151 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6769152 if you trust every web site but not a government
6769153 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate

6769156 my life was sad before because i had to crawl on the ground
6769157 when someone loses a limb they immediately know what theyve lost
6769158 the goal is to restore the healthy self image again so that that person can see themselves whole
6769159 when i finally got into the field of orthotics and prosthetics i said ah ha
6769160 to deliver an artificial limb or brace without follow up doesnt help that person in the long run
6769161 we need to make sure that they have what they need to continue living successfully for years to come
6769162 someone might say i wanna bring 10 people with me next time you come the mixed blessing is theyll bring 50 or 100 people that have physical needs
6769163 the difficulty for me is how do i say no
6769164 it opens a whole other door for many of these folks to experience the world in a way in which theyve never even dreamt of
6769165 and the world has an opportunity to greet them accept them and welcome them back into society so its a double blessing
6769166 if we had a surgeon here we could see eight to 10 patients in a weekend and change their lives forever
6769167 its tough for people to make the choice to give up time with their families and a portion of their income to extend themselves in this way but take it from me the more we give the more we get
6769168 a best deals winner may be obsolete in 2010 due to the collapsing market
6769169 despite the recent dip in gas prices significant auto rebates still exist on many larger vehicles the nissan armada beat the toyota land cruiser on the strength of a 5 000 rebate and the nissan quests 3 500 rebate makes it top in the minivan class
6769170 an interesting fact is nissan has quietly mentioned that the armada may not continue production after early 2010 that is an indication of the new reality of this market and its impact on small cars
6769171 lots of families are looking to make the switch to small cars and its noteworthy that the toyota corolla and toyota yaris two of the top smallest cars in our ranking and highly respected both carry rebates that demonstrates once again how important it is for buyers to do their homework you never know where the deals might be especially in this buyers market
6769172 the chevy silverado has been a solid presence on the best deals lists for months
6769173 however we expect to see the close outs of the 2008 dodge ram and 2008 ford f150 impact these classes as their all new 2009 models roll into the market later this year
6769174 jag har l rt mig otroligt mycket av att vara med dem
6769175 i would like to invite thai fans to watch my final fight i promise to make it an entertaining match and i will do my best for the country
6769176 we always experience some issues with transportation on the first day and the rain only complicates that traffic slows so buses slow and students have to wait in the rain but i think things are going pretty well
6769177 so even in schools that arent air conditioned once we get them there theyre going to enjoy the day
6769178 a lot of people arent back in town or for whatever reason didnt come
6769179 as a rule the figure we have today will go up a little we wont really know until we get the figures in
6769180 i missed my friends and summer got kind of boring
6769181 theres a lot of excitement in the air and im really happy about that
6769182 this was one of the best starts weve had in my four years
6769183 everybody is back in the swing of things so to speak
6769184 we were worried so we got here early to check rooms
6769185 we werent leaking so this summer they obviously got some work done were grateful for that bond money and capital project money
6769186 its amazing to go to schools and see that classes are going on even on the first day
6769187 theyre working and doing things its not just a wasted day
6769188 i want to keep my grades together so i can get into college
6769189 in an ideal world what many of you or most of you do every day shouldnt be impacted
6769190 i felt that a structure similar to this one was the right thing to do so it would be difficult and disingenuous of me to say no to the opportunity
6769191 directionally that is where we would want to go but there is still work to do
6769192 im still not sure if at the end of the day
6769193 are college students at less risk for binge drinking or drunk driving with the limit at 18 or 21 i dont know
6769194 theres data on both sides that we need to examine more carefully keeping the discussion going is important
6769195 i favor retaining the age of 21 as the minimum age for the legal consumption of alcohol of any type
6769196 while a general statement it is more likely that the 21 year old will exhibit a greater degree of personal responsibility than the 18 year old
6769197 lowering the drinking age may exacerbate binge drinking rather than mitigate or prevent it
6769198 peer pressure and the na ve youthful perception of invincibility causes binge drinking lowering the drinking age is not the solution
6769199 its basically a group of young people and they call themselves something different every week
6769200 any time you have a weapon or young people and even adults that think its ok to shoot into a crowd thats very serious
6769201 we see the innocent people in the area getting hit or injured and theyre not even involved in the dispute
6769202 we need to have people start thinking about their actions and the consequences of those actions and their behavior
6769203 to me the big problem with the oil problem is that folks do not understand that we can drill here in america use our own american oil to solve this american problem
6769204 the arguments that they use is that its going to take too long to get this out of the ground i have customers and friends of mine who actually worked on the alaskan pipeline and those guys built 1 700 miles of pipeline within 18 months they took one month off so the caribou could mate
6769205 drilling our way out of this problem didnt work in the 70s and it wont work now our answer to this crisis must be a balanced approach of conservation domestic and alternative energy speculator regulation and closing the enron loophole
6769206 must prioritize the development of domestic and alternative sources of energy to end our reliance on foreign oil
6769207 if its something thats going to reduce the price then she is in fact open to lifting the moratorium
6769208 our opponents have basically spent most of their time bashing the oil and gas industry raising questions about nuclear energy instead of working with us to develop those sources along with renewables
6769209 we have a lot of different legs to this particular stool
6769210 judys entire campaign has been about working across the aisle on issues that she deems important
6769211 i think this would be one of those areas where she and the speaker disagree and i dont think its exclusive to this issue to draw the symbolism between judy baker and nancy pelosi is completely inaccurate
6769212 an effective enterprise wide compliance risk management program is flexible to respond to change and it is tailored to an organizations corporate strategies business activities and external environment
6769213 your governments historic commitment to lead on global warming in europe and around the world
6769214 as proposed these conventional coal plants lack any limits on their emissions of carbon dioxide and would drastically increase the uks carbon dioxide emissions and make achievement of your stated pollution reduction goals extraordinarily difficult if not impossible building new conventional plants and setting the uk up to fail and lose its leadership mantle will make our work in the us all the more difficult
6769215 they can adapt to one to two degrees of warming but if its more than that they cant adapt they are just filled with despair
6769216 as a live planning case i cannot comment on the merits or otherwise or on the timing of any decision
6769217 the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft

6769480 blood pressure bp shows a continuous relationship with the risk of cvd there is substantial evidence that dietary potassium exerts an anti pressor effect most clinical trials have used kcl however the chloride ion may have a pressor effect and in foods potassium is associated with organic anions in a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial we explored the effect on bp of two salts of potassium kcl and potassium citrate k cit in predominantly young healthy normotensive volunteers the primary outcome was the change in mean arterial pressure as measured in a clinic setting after 6 weeks of supplementation compared with the placebo group n 31 30 mmol k cit d n 28 changed mean arterial pressure by 5 22 mmhg 95 ci 8 85 4 53 which did not differ significantly from that induced by kcl n 26 4 70 mmhg 6 56 2 84 the changes in systolic and diastolic bp were 6 69 95 ci 8 85 4 43 and 4 26 95 ci 6 31 2 21 mmhg with k cit and 5 24 95 ci 7 43 3 06 and 4 30 95 ci 6 39 2 20 mmhg with kcl and did not differ significantly between the two treatments changes in bp were not related to baseline urinary electrolytes a greater treatment related effect was observed in those with higher systolic bp increasing dietary potassium could therefore have a significant impact on the progressive rise in bp in the entire population
6769481 every year we experience importation of measles from other countries and from those going abroad but this year is different once measles is imported here were seeing it spread to many more people
6769482 many cases are in children who are eligible for vaccination but who have not been immunized because of parents decisions
6769483 we need very high levels of population immunity approximately 95 percent
6769484 we have been lucky to have low levels of measles and other vaccine preventable diseases but children can still get measles and can still spread measles including to those too young to be immunized and those who cant be vaccinated because of medical reasons
6769485 its important in this country to maintain high levels of vaccination that have been so successful in limiting measles to relatively low numbers over the last decade we would like to remind parents as their children go back to school whether or not they attend in schools or are home schooled or attend day care this is a good time to be considering their vaccination status for measles to protect them from acquiring this disease

6769503 our study confirms that women experience significant bone loss due to cancer treatments and that zoledronic acid can prevent this loss
6769504 while our findings are promising its too early for us to recommend this drug for all premenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer because we dont yet have all the information we need on dosing cost effectiveness and whether this drug actually prevents bone fractures
6769505 however this research does show we need to be more vigilant about monitoring patients bone densities before and during treatment so we can protect bone health and offset bone fracture or osteoporosis risk
6769506 larger percentage of patients treated with vytorin were diagnosed with and died from all types of cancer combined when compared to treatment with a placebo

6769508 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6769509 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6769510 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6769511 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6769512 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers

6769515 when one talks about zero tolerance its effectively saying no you feel a country may not be able to safely send you food that is zero tolerance but if youre reliant on food for imports youve got to look further than that and increase your source of supply
6769516 the way to do this is to use a science basis for making decisions on imports it doesnt mean your standards of food safety decrease in fact because youre being scientific the food safety risk minimises
6769517 if you want to manage risk you need to think about the sources of introduction of disease and one source could be neighbouring countries and if theres difference with respect to the efficiency or the veterinary service its actually quite useful rather than build up a fortress for singapore where you have a big wall around you
6769518 a key initiative that we see as important is developing intelligence networks within the region and globally on food safety animal and plant health issues so that all this data can be brought together to enable improved analysis of risk and this will enhance food safety and biosecurity in singapore
6769519 het was direct vanaf het begin de bedoeling om vijf speelbare klassen in diablo 3 op te nemen om meer vrijheid te hebben tijdens het ontwerp van het spel wilden we vijf compleet nieuwe klassen introduceren een van die nieuwe klassen leek steeds meer op de barbarian uit diablo waarop ik heb gezegd dat we het beestje dan maar gewoon bij zijn naam moeten noemen daardoor keert de barbarian dus terug in het spel hoewel we drie van de vijf klassen nog niet hebben aangekondigd staat voor ons vast welke dat zijn en daar zit de necromancer niet tussen we denken echter al voorzichtig na over een uitbreiding van diablo 3 en daar zou de necromancer best eens in terug kunnen keren
6769520 from the beginning on we wanted to have 5 playable classes for diablo iii to have more freedom during the design of the game we wanted that to be 5 entire new classes one of those new classes started to look and feel like the barbarian more and more so we decided to just call it what it was that is the reason the barbarian is back in diablo iii we have not announced 3 of the 5 classes yet but we allready know what they are going to be and it will not be the necromancer we are however allready considering an expansion to diablo iii and it could very well be that the necromancer is included in that expansion

6769546 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6769547 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6769548 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6769549 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6769550 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6769551 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6769552 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6769553 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6769554 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6769555 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6769556 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6769557 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6769558 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6769559 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6769560 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6769561 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6769562 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6769563 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6769564 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6769565 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6769566 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6769567 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6769568 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6769569 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6769570 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6769571 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6769572 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6769573 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6769574 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6769575 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6769576 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6769577 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6769578 who are open to doing something on the production side
6769579 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6769580 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans

6769590 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6769591 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6769592 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6769593 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

6769597 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6769601 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6769602 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6769603 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6769604 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

6769696 w ith this rate of takeover within a generation most british workers outside the public sector will be working for foreign companies
6769697 the scale of what is happening is truly breathtaking compared with even five years ago
6769698 the final days of imperial britain are bracketed appropriately enough by the funerals of an old man and of a beautiful young woman the first of sir winston churchill reached into a past of grandeur and certainty while the second of diana princess of wales foreshadowed a future of doubt and decline

6769711 could it not be that the trivia and filth of the media do not so much corrupt culture as feed an already corrupted culture

6769723 they will not frame their doings to turn unto their god for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them and they have not known the lord and the pride of israel doth testify to his face therefore shall israel and ephraim fall in their iniquity judah also shall fall with them
6769724 the people do not question their own actions the spirit of whoredoms has thoroughly perverted their minds people like to act religious but they have no desire to truly know god the people are growing worse and worse so ephraim is going to fall hard and fast in their iniquity and the nation of judah or the modern day nation called israel and manasseh america are going to fall with them
