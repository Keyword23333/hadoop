2960047 a gente tem de inverter a rela o n o apesar de suas cren as religiosas e m sticas que o newton consegue dar o pulo do gato nos trabalhos sobre a gravidade justamente devido a elas
2960048 os pr prios estudos b blicos de newton j denotam uma sensibilidade mais cr tica e moderna uma tentativa de estudar as profecias de forma quase matem tica usando cronologias detalhadas
2960049 a gente costuma deixar ci ncia e religi o bem separadas mas o fato que os manuscritos de newton que chegam a 4 000 p ginas abordam principalmente esses estudos m sticos e esot ricos
2960050 com a morte dele a universidade de cambridge e a royal society principal sociedade cient fica do reino unido da qual ele fazia parte que tinham um modelo para o que deveria ser o trabalho cient fico privilegiaram parte da obra dele e deixaram o resto vir a p blico de forma meio aleat ria

2960052 no hebraico b blico existe a palavra makom que significa lugar mas com a evolu o do pensamento rabin co ela passa a designar a pr pria divindade o newton cita essa palavra em seus escritos e parece ter usado o conceito para explicar como a gravidade atuava dist ncia como a gravidade do sol pode atrair a terra por exemplo como se entre o sol e a terra houvesse um makom que deus o qual est em todos os lugares
2960053 o monote smo nos parece simples mas j exige uma forma de pensamento mais sofisticada e abstrata
2960054 e a busca por ess ncias da natureza por leis ordenadas uma coisa que newton compartilha com fil sofos como plat o isso foi incorporado na teologia crist desde o come o
2960055 hay que ir paso a paso el partido que sigue es muy duro estamos hablando de jugadores que est n dentro de los 10 mejores del mundo y tal como uno puede ganar puede perder tambi n pero me siento capacitado para jugar de igual a igual con cualquier jugador y eso es lo importante

2960090 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2960091 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2960092 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2960093 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2960094 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2960095 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2960096 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2960097 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2960104 people on these racist and white supremacist websites are being quite careful because they know that if they make a threat they will very likely get a visit from the secret service

2960106 the groups trading has shown considerable progress and resilience in difficult trading conditions although the overall result is tempered by the operating loss in parts of parson consulting

2960108 ik ben niet zo van het kamperen maar ik ga me daar dit weekend niet te druk over maken al komen we met de tent in de berm te staan het optreden op lowlands compenseert een hoop
2960109 die heb ik n keer eerder gezien dat was ook op lowlands ik had verwacht een bercommerci le hiphop act te zullen zien maar werd positief verrast met een volledige band achter zich maakten ze er een rockshow van
2960110 een heel rustige band ja het concert in paradiso dit jaar was perfect intiem en filmisch ik ben benieuwd of het ze lukt diezelfde sfeer ook in een grote tent als grolsch over te kunnen brengen
2960111 ik wil weten hoe het is om ze te zien het is een legendarische band die na jaren besluit weer op te treden daar moet je van profiteren
2960112 ik ken ze alleen van televisie ik kom uit een arbeidersgezin we hadden weinig geld dus ook voor concertkaartjes hun singles had ik wel ja ik was best punk in die tijd ik had geen weggeschoren haren en andere rare dingen maar het haar hing wel voor mijn gezicht en ik was altijd in het zwart
2960113 vorig jaar met iggy pop was ik daar bang voor maar ik heb mezelf toen ernstig toegesproken dat is niet de manier waarop je naar het optreden moet kijken er zijn genoeg acts op lowlands die wel met hun neus naar de toekomst wijzen zoals ook daar ga ik zeker heen op lowlands staan oude lullen naast de nieuwkomers dat maakt het festival juist zo goed
2960114 die is ook oud techno is wat mij betreft dood ik hoor alleen nog maar klik en klak helemaal niets vernieuwends sven vath is geen techno dj hij is een jukebox op een avond sven vath hoor je twintig jaar house langskomen
2960115 hun album street horrrsing is een te gekke compromisloze weirde plaat met een enorme urgentie
2960116 zon beschuldiging is echt onzinnig het is toch juist heel modern om plagiaat te plegen wat is nog de waarde van auteursrechten het gaat er om dat je gewoon goede muziek maakt om die reden is crystal castles dus erg van nu en zeker waard om te gaan zien

2960123 its a hell of a swim in a pressure packed race hes a true champion
2960124 it was really good fun it was really exciting it was a good experience but you know it wasnt the best that weve dived and it was a bit disappointing

2960127 it was great fun out there everythings been amazing this olympics

2960130 im just trying to fit in and do what they want me to do this season its a real big opportunity for me to earn a starting job
2960131 hes going to hang around here long enough to help this football team
2960132 you want to do certain things well all things you can possibly do to keep yourself on the mind of your coaches
2960133 you want them to think demetrius knows all of the plays or works hard in the weight room or gives all his effort on the field you want to do everything you can so you stick out in their mind when they are deciding who to travel who to play who to put on the depth chart or even who to give a scholarship to in the future
2960134 he let me know how tough the road was going to be and what to expect which he probably didnt have when he came on the team because of not knowing anybody i ask him for a lot of advice and try to study with him he helps me with a few pointers and tells me how to get ahead
2960135 i have always watched him and followed him i have known him since elementary school but we never really played together until high school
2960136 he has always been a big inspiration to me like a hometown hero i tried to be all state and all conference like him and i got there now im trying to do the same thing at marshall
2960137 even back in high school when we played together i always looked up to him

2960145 former capital high stars make impression on herd defensive line
2960146 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium i dont think either of us expected it and especially a gold and a bronze its absolutely amazing
2960147 it hasnt sunk in yet im just over the moon
2960148 i didnt really know what to expect this morning because it was a hard swim last night to get into the final for two british girls to get on the podium is amazing and i am so happy for both of us its great for british swimming
2960149 it was a lot harder this morning we just tried to ignore the times and race the final
2960150 i dont think either of us are natural sprinters we dont do the 100m free so we are naturally suited to the back half of the race
2960151 we didnt panic when we were a little bit behind i didnt see anyone past katie i didnt know what was going on i couldnt see what there was on the other side of the pool i saw katie and just tried to catch her
2960152 i went out a bit slow yesterday so i wanted to go faster today and managed to hold on
2960153 im confident i like being the underdog i like going in and being someone that no one really recognises
2960154 i knew there was a small chance someone would pull out and i just smashed my pb there so im really happy
2960155 i found out last night at 10pm so that had me up for another two hours
2960156 i was mostly relieved and then i knew i could make the final im feeling a bit lucky in this meet so hopefully if all goes well you never know what can happen anyone in the final is going for a medal and thats what im going to be doing
2960157 the last 12 hours have been an emotional rollercoaster for me but anything that doesnt kill you makes you stronger im gaining all the experience i need so im really happy

2960159 the directors of hambledon know of no reason for the recent weakness of the companys share price
2960160 the recent decline in mining equities provided an opportunity to modestly increase our holding in enrc we are the largest single shareholder of enrc with just above 25
2960161 in the second half we have continued to see strong revenue growth and we expect to achieve further improvement in 2009 however profits for 2008 will be affected by higher than expected recent investment and one off exceptional items
2960162 ive been in the nba finals and in the all star game and i havent been as excited to play a game as this one since i was a little kid
2960163 everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people cheering
2960164 this is the only opening game in the olympics that i didnt foul out i think its a treasure in my memory for my life
2960165 it was like the script that somebody could have written
2960166 it was perfect to have the olympics start that way to have pretty much the face of sports in china hit the first shot of the game and its a 3 pointer it doesnt get any better
2960167 if you sat down to write a book youd say how am i going to start this game out
2960168 youd say youd have yao hit a 3 with all that excitement it was great for basketball and we couldnt do nothing but smile on the sidelines
2960169 its the thrill of my life thats about it its hard to describe i just went for it i knew i was lying in fourth thankfully it went my way and i just went for it
2960170 i was under tremendous pressure and at times i felt really agitated
2960171 ive been through a lot of hardship and shed a lot of tears in the last four years there have been successes and failures
2960172 after 2004 my only aim has not changed i had so very much wanted to be a champion at the beijing olympics
2960173 in the last two rounds i made several mistakes because i had used up all my physical and mental energy
2960174 i wasnt thinking of making history i was two points behind the leaders i was just trying to shoot good shots i wanted to shoot well and shoot aggressively and thats what i did
2960175 it shows that shooting is a sport from the first to the final shot every one counts
2960176 i havent prayed so much in my life with the second last shot they tied together and then he bindra shot a 10 8 it couldnt have got better
2960177 i couldnt scratch my nose or feed myself or get a glass of water or pull my pants down
2960178 effort should be made to identify and rescue critical earth system data and ensure persistent access to them
2960179 he is a respected figure amongst the younger players at the club
2960180 the best thing for us to do is respond instantly with a win and thankfully we have a midweek game
2960181 i havent heard anything about interest from any team so this surprises me it is always nice to hear that someone is interested in you that they appreciate you
2960182 but i just want to concentrate on my team rangers

2960190 quando si gioca in olanda non bisogna mai dare nulla per scontato ha spiegato il tecnico francese partiamo favoriti ma ci troveremo di fronte una squadra organizzata e non potremo permetterci cali di tensione

2960193 volevo andare via quando era riserva perch quando si giovani se non si gioca il talento pu appassire ma la societ mi ha sempre visto come una riserva fondamentale

2960198 my colleagues from ajara tv and radio imedi and i took a car to the entrance of the city close to the artillery base near the city limits we saw a dreadful sight
2960199 apart from the base itself two apartment blocks were on fire the yard was full of bodies there was nobody there besides us and as we started to film we heard terrible screams from the buildings at just this moment one of the buildings was hit again and we ran to the cellar
2960200 when we emerged the scene was even worse there were more people lying on the ground
2960201 emergency vehicles and fire trucks arrived on the scene and bombs fell on other apartment blocks in the area but as far as i know there were no casualties there because after the first bombs hit people ran to the cellars for shelter
2960202 according to our count several dozens were killed mostly women and among them a lot of elderly women
2960203 as far as journalists are concerned we received information that several groups of foreign journalists are trapped in the theater of conflict
2960204 you can probably hear the emergency vehicles passing by which are carrying the wounded to tbilisi because goris hospital is already full
2960205 in gori it is quiet i would describe it as dead silence the town is empty
2960206 i can see some people running around mostly middle aged men
2960207 i visited the site where a day earlier the government press center was located but i didnt see anyone there
2960208 i met with residents of nearby villages that are closer to the conflict zone and they complained that nobody had thought about setting up provisional shelters for them
2960209 even the shops are not open so that one could at least buy some bread and water

2960217 already since the start of stage two of monetary member states have no longer been allowed to engage in monetary financing of budget deficits article 104 correspondingly for stage three it is explicitly forbidden for the escb the european system of central banks to supply credit facilities to government bodies or to buy government debt instruments in the primary market in addition financial institutions are not allowed to grant credit to public authorities under preferential conditions article 104a furthermore a bail out of one with financial problems by another country is strictly excluded article 104b finally the treaty obliges eu countries participating in the single currency to avoid excessive budget deficits article 104c compliance with this obligation will be assessed in the context of an elaborate procedure which will ultimately lead to the imposition of sanctions if no effective action is taken to correct an excessive deficit the preventive nature and effectiveness of this procedure has recently been strengthened by the adoption of a stability and growth pact which specifies both the time limits for the consecutive steps in the procedure and the size of sanctions moreover it commits each to target a budgetary position that is close to balance or in surplus over the medium term

2960219 it was an exceptionally good start we were very solid and have more to move on we would have liked to be closer to the usa but should manage that on sunday and look forward to the repechage on wednesday we take weather changes in our stride were used to that in the uk we aim to keep improving
2960220 it was disappointing not to row through the usa we need to improve our final sprint other crews doubling up should have time to recover this is my first olympics and its so exciting we watched rebecca adlington swimming to win this morning it was inspiring its going to be all about the girls for gb this olympics
2960221 its a relief to discover we are faster than the usa we did the start got into rhythm and had a nice pace it was pleasing not to have to push hard to win we knew we were quick in training but its hard to know the form of the other crews it didnt bother us to race one day late but now we have to step up we were watching robin coleman the weightlifter and he inspired us so before the race i quoted him to the others light weight
2960222 its always great to beat the olympic champions we hadnt raced them yet this year so it was a worry but we were going well im pleased with the race but we need to be quicker for the final we arrived 10 days ago so have acclimatised and have another week to prepare for the final race so are feeling pretty comfortable before the start our coach said be in the boat focus and lets see what youre made of
2960223 we all know that times are tough and everyone is being asked to tighten their belts but this is ridiculous
2960224 are they trying to insinuate that councillors are taking crockery home
2960225 rather than sending an e mail to everyone it would surely have just been easier to ask group secretaries to have a look around the office they made it sound like a knife amnesty
2960226 we would be grateful if you could search through your office desks and cupboards for any council crockery and cutlery you may have
2960227 if you do come across any please could you return it to one of the trolleys located in the city chambers

2960246 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
2960247 there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2960248 he is certainly going to use his foreign base to influence thailands domestic politics it is going to be a very long story and this is certainly not the end
2960249 thaksin still has influence over this government and is pulling the strings
2960250 i thought i would be able to prove my innocence and receive justice which is why i returned to thailand on february 28 but the situation has deteriorated
2960251 i have also constantly received news that my life is not safe wherever i travel i have to use bulletproof cars this is the result i got from volunteering to serve the country the king and the people
2960252 the first thing is to love your sport never do it to please someone else it has to be yours
2960253 when anyone tells me i cant do anything im just not listening any more
2960254 when youre expected to win and you have the press saying that you are going to win the olympic gold medal and youre the only sure thing in the olympics it can undermine your confidence
2960255 if you dream and you allow yourself to dream you can do anything and thats what this olympic medal represents
2960256 all ive done is run fast i dont see why people should make much fuss about that
2960257 when i go out on the ice i just think about my skating i forget it is a competition

2960259 it took me time to realize that the men who won olympic gold medals in the decathlon are just men just like me

2960271 facua duda si el motivo por el que la aerol nea ha cancelado las reservas a trav s de las agencias es que stas cometen irregularidades como asegura ryanair o que le est n suponiendo la p rdida de negocios como por ejemplo la contrataci n de seguros que aparecen preseleccionados al comprar billetes en su p gina web sin aclarar que son opcionales una pr ctica que motiv las denuncias de facua el pasado enero contra ryanair y otras ocho aerol neas y agencias

2960277 we see no reason then to change our bearish medium term outlook and reaffirm our r8 50 year end forecast on usd zar
2960278 its true the trade deficit has reduced but the overall current account is still huge and there is no obvious source of funding
2960279 while sentiment in the local market has improved markedly foreigners are still not putting portfolio capital back into the country
2960280 inflows then must be related to either a large corporate deal or short term carry trade flows both of which are not sustainable long term funding the rmb analysts said
2960281 given that the zar rally has been driven by unsustainable flows the rally itself looks unlikely to last in fact the july reserve purchases from the sarb suggest they are unhappy with the units strength
2960282 given that fundamentals remain unchanged we see no reason to alter our core forecast of usd zar8 50 at year end to do so we would need to see evidence either that the current account is reversing or signs of sustainable inflows and we have neither at present
2960283 clearly though the rally has broken the previous trading range of r7 40 50 r8 17 22 the new floor at r7 18 implies a very broad range too wide in fact to be of much use in trading still the 7 40 50 area will still offer support particularly with this seemingly being the trigger for greater sarb reserve accumulation
2960284 the decision by transport for london to break the contract from august 2010 would leave any future supplier with little chance of synchronising the technology in time
2960285 at the moment i am not close to concluding any transfer deal because i am too busy here
2960286 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us

2960288 it was an ideal preparation it was a very pacy game we wanted an intense game and i think ajax gave us more than we wanted they fought for every ball and played well some players are still a bit short physically but im not really concerned we were much better defensively in the second half
2960289 in first half our position on the pitch was not right we changed that at half time and from then on it was much more difficult for ajax to play
2960290 you know arsenal we always create a lot of chances and dont always score all of them but its difficult to complain as well when you score three goals
2960291 in the whole game we were always dangerous going forward but they took advantage of two lapses of concentration and scored two fantastic goals both goals were unstoppable great finishes they were sharp incisive and took advantage of every mistake we made
2960292 we missed nasri tonight who has a little knock we missed diaby and we missed song whos at the olympics i dont know if our midfield tonight was ideal but its certainly not far from the midfield well play wednesday night
2960293 im not concerned about that but i would have been very concerned tonight if we had one or two injuries in midfield we cant afford that at the moment with nasri and diaby out its very positive for us that we have no injuries tonight
2960294 i said many times we are one body short and if you ask me who i cannot answer the question because i dont know more than you
2960295 they have intelligent strikers i was impressed by their efficiency and their movement off the ball and it could be they have a coach who was a striker
2960296 im not too much concerned about the defence because i think we played against a good attack
2960297 they have inherited not only a great player but a great man
2960298 i have nothing against real madrid but it is important that the best players in the world play in england
2960299 you would not like to think that one of the biggest players in the world can just walk out and does not respect his contract
2960300 i dont know what happened but i am happy in the end that the clubs still have some strength
2960301 i have nothing against real madrid but it is important that the best players in the world play in england
2960302 you would not like to think that one of the biggest players in the world can just walk out and does not respect his contract
2960303 takaful islamic insurance in these countries is still new even the muslim countries
2960304 but as far as the non muslim countries there are countries that already have takaful operations places like south africa so we are also focusing on them
2960305 today we were very young but in the end we learned what it is like to defend something we are not used to and it was a good lesson for us overall i am pleased because we lacked a bit of experience but we got a positive result with 1 1 even if overall sevilla had many more chances
2960306 fabianski played very well he was spot on with his decision making and technically what he does was impressive tonight we have two great goalkeepers so that is what i thought at the start
2960307 he is an exciting player i feel he is still not there physically but overall he has all the skill and technical qualities to be an arsenal player
2960308 i am confident and have belief the team will be focused and treat twente with respect we have learned through our experience and i am confident we can qualify you always expect good opposition in holland but i believe we are good enough to get through
2960309 at the moment he is with us and we have had no formal offer from anybody
2960310 i am convinced the frustration we got by not winning it last season will come out for good
2960311 it will strengthen our resolve to do it this time
2960312 we have kept the basis of the team this season ok we have lost gilberto who was very experienced and very important in the dressing room also we lost mathieu flamini and alex hleb but we brought in nasri and also we have many young players who are one year older and have learned a lot
2960313 we have made a big improvement from two years ago to last year and now we want to continue we were a short way from winning the league and the champions league that is why we want to continue with the way we play and keep the belief
2960314 an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to higher fares

2960320 the awards day is always a very special one its an opportunity for our dedicated young supporters to meet the first team but more importantly they get well deserved recognition for personal achievements or bravery
2960321 it was great to come down to emirates stadium for the junior gunners awards again this year what some of these youngsters have experienced or achieved is amazing and this is a great reward for them i hope theyve all enjoyed their day with us for this special ceremony personally i would like to say well done to all of the junior gunners here today

2960324 i am happy to be making the move up a level of course and i will continue to do my best and improve
2960325 but i want to prove myself to be better than that if i get a chance to show i can cope in an even harder environment then i will do it
2960326 for now i feel ready for the reserves i improved a lot for the under 18s last season and i felt with our good team in front of me sometimes it was too easy and my concentration slipped i have been waiting for my chance to move up and it is here now and i want to be 100 per cent ready to perform for them
2960327 but i like that i enjoy coming from crosses getting elbowed and pushed about so it is tougher but that isnt a problem and if i make mistakes i am a young goalkeeper and will learn from it
2960328 coming to a team like arsenal is such a lovely job
2960329 i did not feature much last season which was a big disappointment for me so obviously i just want to play as many games as i can and hopefully ill do that
2960330 have you seen the paris hilton video on the internet
2960331 everything changed some players were playing not in their positions and it is always difficult when you change everything
2960332 but it was difficult personally to see my team mates losing games
2960333 this season we will try to be wiser we will show everyone we are still the gunners and that we can win the title
2960334 we play to win everything and we will try to do it
2960335 i am very happy because i have not been playing for five months so it is great to be back here with all my mates
2960336 we have been getting better and better we are playing quite well at the moment and won on sunday against a good team in real madrid
2960337 we showed everyone that we can still play well even if we have lost some players
2960338 i think he can do it and will show everyone he can play very well
2960339 samir is a very good player and we are lucky to have signed him
2960340 for me it is best just to think of it as a number
2960341 but then i knew what to expect when i picked this number
2960342 i actually asked for no 8 at first but vic akers said that
2960343 he got a lot of criticism after what happened at birmingham last season but until then everybody said he was a fantastic captain
2960344 he acknowledges that he made some mistakes and he has learned from it
2960345 but william is an important player in the team plays in a position where it is easier to be captain and as well some players who could be captain are still young
2960346 if the young players work hard at their game listen to the advice of the coaching staff they realise they will have every opportunity here
2960347 the manager has always said he will play them if they are good enough and he is true to his word he always has been in every way but the bar is extremely high and you have to be over it to get the opportunity
2960348 jack was given the opportunity by the manager to go on the austrian training camp along with five others who have all done really well jack has taken his chance and he is one of quite a few we have here that we have high hopes for
2960349 you have to adapt to the physical aspects of the game and i think jack is strong enough
2960350 i have learned a lot in the last two years because i have been injured so much
2960351 i learned what my body can take and what it cant so it was an interesting period for me
2960352 i hope next season will not be so unlucky with injuries but at the moment i just do not want to think about that the negative stuff if you think positive you get positive
2960353 my target is to be as fit as possible after a month because the season is long we have to build it all up slowly with gym work cardio work and games it is really important for me to get a good start
2960354 last year we had a really good pre season and won almost every game
2960355 then after 50 seconds against fulham on the opening day we were behind so it is hard to predict but hopefully we can get some confidence out of the first few games and slowly build it up
2960356 for every team it is really important to get that confidence if you lose the first few games you are not at your maximum it is important to win to get the answers to the questions
2960357 i think any of the top four can win the title
2960358 i am not going to say we are going to win it because you never know they do not know we do not know either but i hope we can
2960359 arsenal have to win something every year that is our aim
2960360 if we sign a player we will come out and tell you but i can say to you now that we are not close to signing anybody
2960361 i dont know if gareth barry will leave aston villa or not but i am not on his case
2960362 i like gareth barry and i like two or three other players
2960363 he felt that people had questioned his commitment and the best answer to that is to give your all on the pitch
2960364 play well show that you are ready to fight for your shirt fight for your team and be efficient he showed that
2960365 it was a good game with a good intensity for pre season we were not in trouble defensively too much and also created a lot of chances it was very positive our shape was much better than yesterday our movement was better and overall we got what we wanted from these kind of games it was serious but as well we could take different initiatives in the last two days i have learned a lot about my squad and how our preparation has gone it was two great days
2960366 you wouldnt want to put any limitations on his participation in the season because he is only 16 at that age you can improve he looked strong enough and not fazed by the big games the quality is there i dont look too much at his age more at what he is doing on the pitch and right now what he is doing is good
2960367 he is ahead of where he was last year i hope theo is more regular in the team this year no 14 is a big number to inherit but i have confidence in him of course but it is down to performances i feel his first touch is much better he moves the ball quicker and his penetration and final ball is better there is goal scoring potential in him and hopefully one day we will get that out of him for now he is not a link player between the midfield and the strikers like robin van persie can be and he is maybe at the moment a fraction short physically to play as a real target man because there you get bombarded in the air he can play wide right and wide left as well
2960368 i think it was a good game between robinho and bacary sagna he wasnt fazed by the physical challenge if you want to know if i think robinho can adapt in the premier league he looks like he has the ingredients to do it i am not worried if he joins chelsea because chelsea will always have 11 good players on the pitch no matter if it is robinho or somebody else they will always have the choice
2960369 we had a very young side especially in the first half and played well we were unlucky to concede the goal and maybe lacked a bit of experience to score as well as some physical match sharpness there were some heavy legs but it will get better over the next two weeks
2960370 do not be impressed by his small size because he is not fazed by the physical challenges he really looks mature on the pitch but he is 16 and we have to respect his development however do not reproach me now about not playing english players
2960371 i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love to me face to face he always told me he wants to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me he is not going anywhere even if you come with a 747 plane full of money
2960372 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have if we can find someone then we will do it if not i am happy as well
2960373 experience wise we a bit short in midfield but we will see with diaby not being injured denilson being available we have quality in there today we did not have rosicky fabregas eduardo van persie and song they are five top class players
2960374 last year we were really really unlucky we were only four points adrift and lost only three games in two of those we were leading 1 0 until 15 minutes before the end we also got some bad injuries
2960375 we need to strengthen belief not only in the way we play but the way we work we must keep complete confidence in these young players
2960376 the term used to describe the marketing technique of preparing a website to enhance its chances of being ranked in the top results of a search engine once a relevant search is undertaken a number of factors are important when optimizing a website including the content and structure of the websites copy and page layout the html meta tags and the submission process
2960377 if we can do one more signing we will do it
2960378 we dont need money to buy someone and its not just about buying it has to be the right person and that is very difficult at the moment
2960379 its not a problem if we dont sign anyone because we have enough young players who can step in but we lost experience and if we can get a midfielder with experience who can play a tactical role we will do it we need one more body in there
2960380 adebayor is an arsenal player and will play for arsenal next season
2960381 for me there has been no trouble because when a player is a true professional he goes onto the pitch and tries to play the football he loves
2960382 what is very damaging sometimes is that the player gets bad publicity against his own fans for things he has not said
2960383 it the champions league is a big target for us and of course when you go to holland you get a game
2960384 its a football country the clubs are always well organised and we will be favourites it will be important for us to be at the top of our concentration to go through
2960385 we play the first game away we know we are a wanted target and we want to go to the first game with a top level concentration
2960386 its the players on the pitch who play the biggest part
2960387 steve mcclaren will get his team well organised and make it difficult for us but i still feel the biggest part will be how well we will play and how we will go into the game
2960388 de familie van marleen veldhuis heeft mij wel geraadpleegd kort later konden ze de tickets kopen ik regel het graag maar uiteraard moet men dan wel naar mij toekomen het is jammer dat dit te weinig is gebeurd
2960389 the objective is for us to progress so we will try and like the boss says i think we have the quality to compete in this league
2960390 we will show everyone and if we progress we have the chance to win the league
2960391 of course man u and chelsea are strong sides as are liverpool and tottenham they are building new teams but i am really confident with the quality we have got and i cant wait for the season to start it is going to be an exciting one and we will be up for it
2960392 for me it is different because the boss is french and he brought me here i dont know many managers in football but i think he is one of the best
2960393 to work with a manager like him and players like cesc and robin we are all around 22 to 25 and it is a dream to play for arsenal

2960402 an adventure is only an inconvenience rightly considered an inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered
2960403 it would absolutely suck if you paid a few bucks for a book only to find that on the first page it said once upon a time they all lived happily ever after and the rest of the book was blank
2960404 if you want a happy ending that depends of course on where you stop your story
2960405 the recent rumours saying that the russian airports are prohibiting ra citizens from exporting meat products made in armenia are not officially confirmed as rosselkhoznadzor russian agricultural regulatory authority did not officially notified us about it

2960408 diplomacy is the art of saying nice doggy whilst looking for a really big stick
2960409 how come i cant find my way back to reality while for most of the arab youth they either live without dreams or dream without living
2960410 no more talk about youth and what they can or cannot it is time for us to starting doing instead of just being a subject for discussion
2960411 the primary results show that sawsan wasnt kidnapped she disappeared for other reasons
2960412 the price for a 200 liter container of diesel reached yr 22 000 from its previous price of yr 7 500
2960413 now that peace has been restored overall in the area we need to cooperate together to rebuild what has been destroyed
2960414 we have done extensive focus group discussions with men and women in the largest internally displaced persons idp camp in al anad where around 800 families are located
2960415 during the last five days some of the locals went to inspect the damage in their homes and returned to the camps because there was nothing left for them back there
2960416 some people have fainted because of hunger epidemics spread especially because of the four weeks siege and now there is much help needed
2960417 educated wives are not narrow in their thinking and look at life from a more rational perspective
2960418 my educated wife always does everything without tasking her to o so and that makes me feel rest and saves my time
2960419 an educate wife tries as much as possible to make the marrige life better and suitable
2960420 my educated wife works as a teacher in a one of the governmental schools and though her salary is not too much she offers many things which are required for home
2960421 our ministry was the first to respond to kab because we realize the challenges facing yemeni youth in the market place
2960422 this is important for us because as a ministry we are the body most concerned with providing the yemeni market and even neighboring countries with skilled labor there is an imbalance currently existing between the universities and vocational training because the majority of yemeni youth would prefer to get a university degree rather than a skill our job is to change this
2960423 we understand that yemen has its own particularities and there are things that you can never teach in a classroom however the aim of this subject is to change attitudes and encourage yemeni youth to explore the possibility of creating small and micro enterprises instead of waiting to be employed
2960424 the veil is a type of witchcraft attracting mens attention because we try to discover the hidden face behind the veil
2960425 the veil is a cover for vice because women can do anything they wish without being discovered unveiled women may capture our first glance but veiled ones capture our curiosity
2960426 no one forced me to veil i choose to wear it because all of the females in my family wear it
2960427 id seen her walking about but she was always veiled
2960428 fill shortcomings of the law that have appeared over the past period as well as enhance guarantees for free and credible elections thereby implementing european union recommendations following the most recent presidential election
2960429 enhance the election committees independence and impartiality organize election security expand local and international observation of the elections and specify the observers rights and commitments
2960430 agreement of all political parties in forming the election commission
2960431 its good for all active political parties to reach an agreement
2960432 the supreme commission for elections and referendum which will commence working by the end of august will form the observation committee since the other technical and administrative preparations already have been done by the current election commissions general secretariat
2960433 dont exist in any leadership positions except in five out of 12 parties in yemen
2960434 interregional cooperation to strengthen social inclusion gender equality and health promotion in the millennium development goals mdgs
2960435 during the past few years the use of the internet as a modern replacement for telephony has accelerated
2960436 the ability to include more media in calls provides an excellent opportunity to include people with disabilities in online conversational services but too often discriminatory voice telephony services are simply re created
2960437 internet telephony is rapidly becoming a major way of staying in touch but it breaks the traditional text telephone which deaf and hard of hearing people used in the past to call each other the real time text technique addresses this problem and can be integrated with internet telephony
2960438 accessibility for persons with disabilities is critical and must be maintained in the coming convergence
2960439 but it is worth pointing out that like many disability projects this effort has the potential to provide more options and greater usability for all users in many situations
2960440 as an art form theatre has not only enriched our social life by providing education and entertainment but also helped us discover and understand ourselves and our society the dubai theatre festival for youth provides a platform for the youth of this country to express themselves creatively and artistically events like these are a critical part of dcaas effort to raise the quality of cultural life in dubai
2960441 the dubai theatre festival for youth is born out of our commitment to provide opportunities for young people in dubai to showcase their artistic talent as part of promoting art we are keen not only to encourage accomplished artists but also young people who show enthusiasm for art forms like theatre we invite the widest possible range of young people to take advantage of the opportunities provided at the festival
2960442 the president did not talk to the field leader of the diehard huthi fighters
2960443 the huthis have opened the blockades of most of the garrisons that were besieged before the truce
2960444 the huthis have actually taken over several positions and villages which were not in their domain before
2960445 islam muslim tradition and the west not wanting to upset the east
2960446 in iraq there are jihad and wealth we are a generous nation which sacrifices its peoples lives let alone their wealth
2960447 those who listen to what is being said and utilize the best of it
2960448 this attack was carried out in revenge for our brothers whose blood is on the hands of the infidel yemeni forces
2960449 defending islam against rallies and celebrations that pollute the minds of our sons and daughters through singing impudence and mixing of the two sexes
2960450 seeing how successful our brother is we realized that a university degree or a job with the government is not the best thing
2960451 the problem is that the society looks down upon graduates from the technical and vocational institutes
2960452 even the private sector does not encourage these graduates and so the only people who opt for such technical education are the ones who were not accepted anywhere else
2960453 once we had enough evidence that this would prove useful for yemeni youth we held a workshop with stake holders and presented this training idea to them
2960454 at the time they all seemed enthusiastic about the idea but so far only the ministry of technical education and vocational training has taken serious steps to introduce kab into yemeni e alawi mohammed a bafaqih the vice minister of technical education and vocational training ducation
2960455 which is what business in real life is all about
2960456 it is impossible to create businessmen and businesswomen in one year what we hope to do is to encourage such thinking and lay the fundamental skills for youth so that they build on this in real life where they would be on their own
2960457 i wasnt allowed to travel to syria to participate in an event that was so important to me and in which i was a key player my family said they wouldnt allow their daughter to travel by herself to such an event if it had been my brother who wanted to go it wouldve been no problem i hate that
2960458 like martin luther king i too have a dream i have a dream that one day our young men and women will rejoice at a life without discrimination degradation and oppression
2960459 empower youth legally because this is exactly what they need in order to find their place in the sun
2960460 societies that take no interest in womens and youth issues are rigid societies with no hope for development the solution is to listen to the young generations and hold constructive dialogue with them
2960461 we want teachers to respect us and work with us not against us
2960462 i have a dream that one day our young men and women will rejoice at a life without discrimination degradation and oppression
2960463 im scared that the number of fanatics is growing im afraid that a day will come when the rights ive earned regarding education work and public participation will be taken from me on the pretext of religion
2960464 lets face it we arent equal there will always be someone who has a better opportunity than me because he or she knows some vip or has more money or a strong family name
2960465 its a shame that we dont live up to our principles because theres so much to learn from islam that could make us world pioneers
2960466 let the people be the judge not the ministry of information or any media council governed by the government the people are the ultimate judges who will make a particular media either successful or not worthy of their time
2960467 it would be chaotic and blasphemy and insult would spread
2960468 im delighted that i witnessed a sense of noble partnership and a true desire to listen and comprehend but i also saw signs of creativity pioneering and leadership and this has made me glad i can say that this event was a great success
2960469 i cant deny that im a nerd im not a smooth type of girl
2960470 something people go through in their lives especially growing up in london
2960471 if she died in a car crash does it mean id have to run out in front of a car and itd be history repeating itself

2960473 a bit more principles of exceptional customer service a call center provides same reception to its clientele for items such as dishes use either void space within the box or rolled foam to separate each piece
2960474 to see what i mean better yet see the site for yourself before they decide to increase the price with almost no refunds they are thinking that the price is too low and perhaps will raise it
2960475 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around 7 p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
2960476 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
2960477 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
2960478 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all

2960498 you want to take bosnia and herzegovina down the same highway to hell and suffering that croatia are travelling do not think that you will not lead bosnia and herzegovina into hell and do not think that you will not perhaps lead the muslim people into annihilation because the muslims cannot defend themelves if there is war how will you prevent everyone from being killed in bosnia and herzegovina

2960506 this year we are facing problems due to the tension prevailing in the region it has become difficult for us to take our fruits to the market the customers used to come to us but this year they have not turned up because of the tense situation in the area if this goes on then all our crops will be rotten
2960507 i am extremely delighted and proud to hear today that you have realized the dream of a billion of our people by winning the olympic gold medal in the 10 metre air rifle event in beijing
2960508 your achievement today should inspire confidence amongst all indian sportspersons that they can achieve the pinnacle of any sport at the international level it should also be an inspiration for more of our youth to take up sports as a full time career
2960509 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength

2960520 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
2960521 this election is about not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
2960522 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
2960523 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
2960524 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named
2960525 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
2960526 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
2960527 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
2960528 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about
2960529 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
2960530 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things

2960553 you can clean the puppys ears if they get dirty or just whenever you give him a bath
2960554 no he may not like it and may shake his head but it shouldnt hurt just make sure you dont stick anything like a q tip into his ear
2960555 you mean how do you actually give him a bath

2960597 voluntary efforts alone will not solve the climate change problem
2960598 we see a whole suite of technologies to solve these problems and we think the uncertainty of what regulations will do are holding companies back

2960600 was it wrong to try to get the city back on its feet as quickly as possible
2960601 safety was first and foremost but we werent going to let the terrorists win
2960602 i think that she wanted to push the administration towards regulating greenhouse gases putting caps on carbon dioxide emissions but the white house and the vice presidents office just simply wouldnt allow it
2960603 at times it seemed as if ms whitman had been appointed merely to make the bush administration seem more interested in the environment
2960604 yet if she really disagreed with some of the decisions it seems strange that ms whitman stayed in her job as long as she did
2960605 you know i guess the best way to describe government policy is like a person trying to drive a car in a rough patch
2960606 if you ever get stuck in a situation like that you know full well its important not to overcorrect because when you overcorrect you end up in the ditch
2960607 i think 2008 is going to be a fabulous year for the republican party

2960614 shoulda woulda coulda kinda eerily reminiscent of right wing criticisms of the prosecution of the viet nam conflict
2960615 the stern review should be considered a conservative estimate of the dangers
2960616 climate change might in the end prove itself an optimal crisis it could be among the catalytic forces along with reaching peak oil production and other forms of ecological exhaustion that are grave enough to break us out of our cultural trance yet not so insurmountable as to crush our spirit it might spur human society to the fundamental transformation that our culture so desperately needs to move us from a culture of consumption and waste and isolation to one of sustainability and community and yes ill say it happiness
2960617 increasing transportation efficiency is the best place to start efforts to reduce emissions of co2 of all co2 emissions in the united states
2960618 if we switched from gasoline cars to evs all electric vehicles and plug in hybrids recharged by our existing utility grids which mostly use fossil fuels we would see a 42 percent national average reduction in co2 emissions according to research by peter lilienthal of the national renewable energy laboratory
2960619 this is the way it has been and always will be
2960620 its not too late to act on global warming provided we take strong united global action starting now and increasing over the next 10 years

2960622 i dont believe in hope if you want to see something happen its better to pray and to act
2960623 it is the capacity for denial of using belief as a bulwark against sophistication of any kind moral aesthetic intellectual that keeps the american character from awakening
2960624 the responsibilities are to first of all pay enormous reparations
2960625 pay no attention to chomsky and many other progressive writers
2960626 indeed the roman state saw itself not as just marginally better than those beyond its frontiers but massively and absolutely superior because its social order was divinely ordained
2960627 the overwhelming implications of this attitude were first that conflict should be the normal state of relations between roman and non roman and second that the roman empire should be victorious in whatever it aspired to what did divine favour mean if not security against defeat that the hands of those lacking that divine favour
2960628 i mean even if it were true which is extrememely unlikely who cares you know i mean it doesnt have any significance uh i mean its a little bit like the huge energy thats put out trying to find out who killed john f kennedy i mean yah who knows and who cares i mean plenty of people get killed all the time what does it matter that one of them happened to be john f kennedy
2960629 the shame of noam chomsky and the gatekeepers of the left
2960630 everybody talks about the weather but no one ever does anything about it
2960631 whats behind the shameless demagoguery and character assassination being heaped on climate change
2960632 oh is going to be a little hotter in the summer

2960637 the same brain machinery that responds to the active substance in mj provides a central
2960638 ultimately the fact that rappers are now being held accountable for something imus said shows the bias many people have against hip hop culture hip hop is often the scapegoat of everything gone wrong in america but hip hop didnt slander the rutgers womens basketball team don imus did so lets stay on point here the point is hip hop didnt invent cursing slurs bad language sexism or misogyny though hip hop like so many other fictional forms of the culture uses this type of language as a form of expression however problematic it might be this expression represents the way people in the streets talk it might not be pretty or politically correct but it is a unique form of fictional expression that emerges from the minds and mouths of young black men
2960639 and the worst thing is his so called jokes arent even that funny
2960640 a dumb rich slut with a cock in her mouth
2960641 the idea that anyone in the media world gives a shit about the dignity of women black or white is a ridiculous joke
2960642 rap portrayal of black culture and exposed it for what it is
2960643 imus is out but whitey writers get the last laugh

2960673 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2960674 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states

2960676 its good to send a signal to the chinese people that we respect them that this is about their country
2960677 he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
2960678 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2960679 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2960680 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2960681 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2960682 you told me more about the process than i know
2960683 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2960684 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2960685 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2960686 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2960687 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2960688 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands

2960701 and for some people oprah is clearly one of them
2960702 i want to speak to you today regarding the miserable condition to which pakistan has deteriorated
2960703 let there be no doubt in your minds that dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2960704 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2960705 we know they havent left and are continuing to shoot at our peacekeepers

2960710 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2960711 we never had in mind that it would be for major development
2960712 this was to help our troops fight the counterinsurgency and to help civilians get on their feet it is looking like it is a bank for development
2960713 youve then got somebody coming around to a commander handing him a bag of 25 000 cash and saying to go rebuild iraq
2960714 what have you done to win iraqi hearts and minds today
2960715 a rifle only gets you so far it shows you have some force cerp allows you to develop our answer to al qaeda

2960727 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2960728 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2960729 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2960730 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2960731 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2960732 it appears the way the numbers have fallen short means that the country liberals with the support of territorians have done exceptionally well but have fallen short
2960733 mistakes have been made in the election campaign i acknowledge that i take those on my shoulder
2960734 look im not going to say that the last few days havent been difficult they really have been
2960735 i was running and kept touching my head legs and arms to make sure i wasnt hurt because i couldnt believe i wasnt hit

2960744 my wife and i have come to reside in england
2960745 he is certainly going to use his foreign base to influence thailands domestic politics
2960746 there may be a serious conflict in the long run that results in extreme violence if some decide they cannot rely on the judiciary for justice
2960747 still has influence over this government and is pulling the strings
2960748 i thought i would be able to prove my innocence and receive justice which is why i returned to thailand on feb 28 but the situation has deteriorated
2960749 i have also constantly received news that my life is not safe wherever i travel i have to use bulletproof cars this is the result i got from having volunteered to serve the country the king and the people
2960750 my goal is to try to get number one ranking back
2960751 i need to play well again i need to win the big matches thats what im looking at at the moment
2960752 you cant keep your ranking forever i think you have to have a different approach see whats the next step
2960753 what i dont like to do because you dont play so well is freak out and have emergency meetings thats not going to happen
2960754 being at the top doesnt mean number one in the world
2960755 it can mean deep into grand slams you know being in the top five top 10 for whatever 10 years 15 years just be up there and having a shot at grand slams
2960756 im not criticising its just a fact with the olympic games everything shifted it made it really hard for us to have proper preparations
2960757 you start to doubt yourself just a touch even though i felt like i was playing well moving well

2960762 die sommerpause hat uns allen gut getan wir haben nach le mans erst einmal zwei wochen pause gemacht
2960763 mit vollen batterien haben wir dann wieder gas gegeben die jungs haben den wagen in einigen bereichen weiter optimieren k nnen und wir haben beim test in die richtige richtung gearbeitet ich freue mich sehr auf unser heimrennen am ring
2960764 wir hatten mit den drei lms rennen den 24 stunden von le mans und unseren tests eine wirklich intensive erste jahresh lfte
2960765 leider sind wir bisher nicht f r unsere bem hungen und anstrengungen belohnt worden leider oder gott sei dank ist der level in der serie inzwischen so hoch dass man sich als team immer weiter verbessern muss deshalb bereiten wir uns zum teil auch schon auf 2009 vor
2960766 es war gut dass ich nach meinem unfall in le mans vor dem rennen am ring noch einmal im auto sitzen konnte das team macht einen guten job und der lola f hlt sich mit den verbesserungen gut an bisher waren wir nicht gerade vom gl ck verfolgt wir hoffen dass sich das nun ndert und wir am n rburgring ein gutes ergebnis einfahren k nnen
2960767 ich bin berzeugt dass sich die bem hungen des teams bald bezahlt machen werden die nderungen vom letzten test stimmen mich positiv ebenso die zuverl ssigkeit die der lola und speziell der mazda motor an den tag legen ich freue mich dass es endlich wieder losgeht
2960768 das ist zun chst erstmal eine entscheidung der hessischen freundinnen und freunde
2960769 wir sind bereit beratend und mit berlegungen zur seite zu stehen
2960770 its a dream come true for all chinese and were especially honoured as were so old some close to 60 but yet we can still perform at the olympics it makes us extremely happy
2960771 performing at the olympics will be the happiest and proudest moment for me even my hometown folks are proud of me saying that its not easy to get into the birds nest stadium
2960772 wonderful days reflects our good life now after reform and opening up and the good situation in china many chinese are grateful for our prosperity and this is the most important thing i wish to convey
2960773 when im happy im in a good mood and this removes all illness and helps me forget all my troubles
2960774 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2960775 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2960776 scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2960777 wie ben je en wat is er met phil gebeurd
2960778 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2960779 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2960780 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2960781 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2960782 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2960783 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2960784 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2960785 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2960786 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2960787 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2960788 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2960789 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2960790 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2960813 their defensive pressure was challenging for us and we lost our poise early
2960814 we got back to 10 12 points to make it a winnable game then we fouled gave up a couple of transition baskets and they were back out to 15 20 we just couldnt quite get close enough to really put the pressure on them
2960815 but spains a really good team we fell behind early and you cant do that against such a talented team
2960816 weve still got to knock someone over so weve got to regroup focus on china now and try and do the little things right that we couldnt get this morning
2960817 we are honored that bowen family homes has joined our family of clients it is a tremendous boon to be recognized and selected by one of the most forward thinking emarketing homebuilders in the industry
2960818 we selected lead velocity because of its reputation in the builder industry and its focus on delivering detailed buyer behavior and preference data to our on line sales counselors

2960837 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2960838 what we need now is a far greater degree of personal responsibility and decision far more independence from the government and a comparative reduction in the role of government
2960839 individuals prosper best within a strong active society whose members acknowledge that they owe duties to each other as well as themselves
2960840 the rights and wrongs of being a citizen of the state or member of a local community
2960841 in the welfare reform and pensions bill for instance the government requires stakeholder pension funds to be established within existing trust law and run by a board of trustees while allowing for other governance structures to be approved in the future stakeholder pensions should promote an inclusive community based on partnership hence the fund must accept low minimum contributions and allow members to stop and restart contributions without any penalty such regulations will ensure that everyone can join a fund people in low paid part time or irregular work many of whom are excluded from the existing schemes should have improved opportunities to save for retirement
2960842 the welfare state encourages a culture of dependency among an underclass of welfare recipients
2960843 the market doesnt like that it likes to segment the risk pool into winners and losers so that it can cherry pick it wants to take the profits from the low cost treatments and healthy patients

2960848 russia today demonstrates an equal and opposite bias in its focus on south ossetian casualties
2960849 developing measurement technologies to understand how people perform is an absolutely fundamental part of coaching
2960850 by putting all those sensors together you get a really accurate picture of how an individual is performing you can then relay that information in real time to a coach and they can see for example what the athlete is doing and how they can change their technique
2960851 its for when you are first learning and you are trying to visualise what you are going to see
2960852 it is to help the athlete learn orientation as they are doing the dive
2960853 the challenge for us was putting them up in swimming pools that werent designed to take them
2960854 we are looking at other ways other than evaporative heat loss to remove heat from the body
2960855 the aerodynamics particularly in the cycling events and triathlon events can make quite a significant difference to the amount of effort thats expended
2960856 but if the cost of that is that body temperature reaches the level at which heat exhaustion is likely then it is not a trade off you are going to accept
2960857 it is very adjustable to different people but it also much better mimics the track cycling event

2960859 the actions of the russian federation endanger not only the lives of georgian civilians but also those of high ranking guests
2960860 the georgian government political goal is not to place south ossetia under any totalitarian control the need of an autonomy in the area remains but it must be at the level of the highest european standards
2960861 despite the military conflict and the bloodshed there is still a possibility to lead all this to a peaceful dialogue the information that georgian military forces have fired at russian peacekeepers is entirely sacrilegious we propose that russia becomes one of the main guarantors for the autonomy of the ossetia region as part of georgia
2960862 if georgia falls this will also mean the fall of the west in the entire former soviet union and beyond leaders in neighboring states whether in ukraine in other caucasian states or in central asia will have to consider whether the price of freedom and independence is indeed too high
2960863 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2960864 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states

2960869 the georgian gambit of trying to push the russians out of its breakaway border territories seems to have had the opposite effect of consolidating russian control

2960892 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2960893 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2960894 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2960895 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2960896 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2960897 its a new game and a new challenge and i know ive got a lot to learn but im excited to be learning off one of the all time greats in tana umaga
2960898 i think if i am as committed as i was to playing rugby league and learning the game then the next two years will work out
2960899 theres short term goals and theres long term goals like playing for the all blacks
2960900 i want to become a dominant centre and be considered one of the best centres going around in world rugby and i want to play for the all blacks one day
2960901 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2960902 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2960905 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2960906 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead the central bank said in its quarterly monetary policy statement released today
2960907 we shouldnt be surprised that the global oil shock and the global credit crunch together with eight official rate rises in three years are impacting on our economy treasurer wayne swan told the global foundation
2960908 like the rest of the world we havent been immune from these global difficulties
2960909 in a globalised economy we dont expect a smooth rise but we are better placed than most other countries to withstand the fallout
2960910 this could lead to a significant deterioration in the outlook for the australian economy and commodity markets the rba said
2960911 past experience suggests that once the bank has made up its mind it tends not to wait too long before acting especially when it probably discussed cutting rates this month abn amro chief economist kieran davies said
2960912 this suggests that the public would support government intervention that would regulate the industry and protect the general public against rate rises by banks essential said
2960913 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia

2960915 i want to speak to you today regarding the miserable condition to which pakistan has deteriorated
2960916 let there be no doubt in your minds that dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america

2961022 were sort of slow but we definitely had some good attacks coming people were just trying to position themselves and figure where everyone else sat there were some really strong attacks that came on the hills and i just tried to stay with them
2961023 she was on the front a ton during the race she was really strong
2961024 she didnt have that much of a gap but it was a little bit and i thought it was now or never i jumped on my own and i just kept going i figured why not

2961061 since reaching an all time low against the major currencies in mid march the u s dollar has climbed 6 per cent
2961062 the greenbacks improved fortunes are owed largely to two factors falling commodity prices and sagging overseas economies

2961202 the reasons behind the lack of preparation were highlighted again when respondents were asked about the frequency with which they update the companys it security
2961203 just 48 do so daily 17 weekly and 12 monthly the biggest concern however is that 5 update their security yearly and 37 do so when an update is ready worryingly 9 do so only when they actually get attacked
2961204 no most of the coverage ive seen has been focused on the sports with only a brief mention of politics
2961205 yes theres been more footage of the politicians at the games than the athletes
2961206 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2961207 you have to get focused and give it a go
2961208 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2961209 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2961210 i turned to my caddie on 16 and said god this is a lot of fun just to watch
2961211 being able to master all three sports and do them well in succession is very unique
2961212 some people are there just to do it and thats what is so wonderful about triathlon
2961213 so instead of yelling youre an ironman to the winners when they cross the finish line we yell youre a pumpkinman
2961214 the last thing i wanted to do was walk that guy
2961215 it was the perfect time for us because of our situation where were at
2961216 we really need to win thank god everything came through my way
2961217 guy throwing hard threw me a good pitch it sunk
2961218 tough to swallow whenever you go out there and you have a game plan and execute it and it still doesnt work out
2961219 we took him out a little early the other night
2961220 he was getting stiffer and stiffer as the game progressed it was getting hard to get loose he was still throwing great
2961221 were trying to not have this thing get to the point where it did last year
2961222 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different
2961223 i think they knew that history was being made tonight
2961224 obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
2961225 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy
2961226 im kind of glad its out of the way now this game was just over the top
2961227 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you and so go out there and kick some butt
2961228 so i think that it will be good for us
2961229 you just had to smile because you couldnt write it any better
2961230 it remains to be seen if they will obey the law id love to see each meeting on television so everyone can see what theyre doing
2961231 i had trouble getting minutes a few years ago and was shut down three times
2961232 at the time i didnt pursue it the middle school is an important issue i was looking to see what might be discussed at the may 27 meeting i checked the agenda to see if theyd be talking about the middle school i called a board member and he said maybe they would discuss it even though it wasnt on the agenda i skipped the meeting only to learn there was a motion made to instruct the architects to design a school for 650 students thats a huge decision the minutes said they made the motion based on a may 20 discussion
2961233 i went to city hall and no one had seen the minutes
2961234 i wrote a letter to the city council saying this was no way to do business
2961235 i knew id need the information to make my court case stronger
2961236 i found 15 instances going back to january 2006 i didnt go any further back i wrote a letter to superintendent bob lister asking for all the missing minutes in court it became obvious they didnt exist
2961237 i told the court this was part of larger pattern
2961238 the meetings are usually held at little harbour school where there are no broadcast facilities
2961239 so they only broadcast about half of them at city hall the focus on minutes becomes less important if they would broadcast all the meetings they are not interested in doing that
2961240 subject to board approval pan am has agreed to turn over the equipment to the pda in exchange for not having to undertake the repair work on the pdas tow tractor which was on loan to pan am
2961241 an immediate need to provide a continuum of service to existing airport general aviation tenants
2961242 pda needs to immediately formulate a plan to develop new revenue streams to make up for the loss of revenue resulting from the departure of
2961243 it wont be 10 000 now and 20 000 later will it
2961244 the original agreement was for pan am to leave the airport entirely
2961245 the company later offered to remain a fixed base operator here and the board was made aware of that but the original agreement was upheld
2961246 when pan am suggested that it continue to operate the fbo to maintain competition and provide continuity to pan ams tenants former pda executive director dick green made it clear that the pdas priority was to remove all of pan ams presence from pease regardless of the effect that such action might have on tenants and other users of the airport
2961247 as a result while pan am had hoped to provide continuous fbo services at pease it was made clear that this was not an option leaving pan am with little choice but to accept the pdas offer and implement the shutdown of its fbo
2961248 there is some light at the end of the tunnel were going to apply for manuchos work permit and were hopeful well get that danny welbeck is coming through and will be back in two or three weeks fraizer campbells showing the progress we expect of him and is a handful its not a bad thing relying on youth the team was playing well today dominating possession and having some good chances i know were having a problem scoring but well have players coming back and we will eventually add to the squad
2961249 rios an absolutely magnificent player whos approaching his best on that basis hes becoming the best central defender in the world by far it was an exemplary display at centre back intercepting every ball that came towards him and breaking out of central defence with comfort
2961250 but there were some other fine performances out there look at carlos tevez a year ago hed been to the copa america and he was not as fit as he is today hes light years ahead of that i expect big things from him this season hes got a lot of heart to play the game is never intimidated fights for every ball that comes near him hes a real handful
2961251 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
2961252 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america

2961254 we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2961255 i definitely have to say it is an honor to be the lead
2961256 but we are just four races into this and its a long regatta were not even halfway
2961257 i think the people who know what the fire department needs are already here on the inside
2961258 this is all about getting kids excited and feeling involved
2961259 people want a change in the way the federal government works
2961260 this election is a chance to change the future of the state the country up and down the ballot
2961261 they said they had to shut down the program because of no interpreter but we think its a lie and its about money
2961262 i dont want to go to rochester because ive been through it all in the system and its not good this is my sixth school i want to stay here until i graduate
2961263 i grew up here and i know a lot of people they are my classmates and i want to graduate with them
2961264 im really upset we dont have a lot of choices its really messed up
2961265 its not personal at all we adored the kids we felt very bad about it but theres not much we can do
2961266 we did an exhaustive search for interpreters and i feel very confident we did all we can do
2961267 nothing bad happened we certainly wouldve taken them right to the end theyre lovely kids popular and good students
2961268 weve tried everything shes written the governor commissioners the legislature and they all say theres nothing that can be done
2961269 when we get out and out thunderstorms that keeps people home
2961270 i think it does help that portsmouth is very walkable
2961271 lets face it theyve got to do something theyve lived with this complex for a long time and its overcrowded a new middle school is needed thats it
2961272 and neither i nor anyone in my family would want to be thought of as obstructionists especially as it pertains to education
2961273 i represent the eighth generation in portsmouth and thats not what were about
2961274 i think everyone thought it was just a fait accompli people had no idea of the deed restriction or completely misinterpreted it
2961275 it got to the point where i had a pretty good head of steam on i was tired of hearing about it and the assumptions that it was just going to happen i was ready to go to war
2961276 this is a matter of pride and family honor and an agreement that was made between my family and the city were not going to go away were not going to roll over
2961277 what im interested in is open space within the context of land conservation and stopping urban sprawl i dont want another ball field
2961278 look at whats happened in the past 10 years open space is just being gobbled up and once its gone its gone
2961279 basically if you dont make 50 000 to 60 000 a year its going to be difficult for you to purchase a home under this ordinance
2961280 a teacher making 33 000 a year could start with a rental and then move into a townhouse and finally a home as her income increases
2961281 but currently deerfield place for instance is more dense than would be allowed under this ordinance
2961282 no family living in new hampshire or anywhere else in this great country should have to choose between food to fuel their bodies and fuel to heat their homes each are necessary ingredients in sustaining healthy lives
2961283 we have a bucket on the counter for the york community food pantry and i had noticed there were some bills in there
2961284 i saw some bills and i opened the top and i saw a 50 bill so i pulled it out and i realized it wasnt one it was six six 50 bills i counted it once i counted it again i counted it three times
2961285 they came with the idea that they were going to do that the only way people would have known that is if they saw the article
2961286 three hundred dollars to us means we can buy about 1 200 of food from the food bank
2961287 i think its terrific the cooperation were getting from the kettle boys is phenomenal this 300 means they basically met their goal for the year
2961288 now our goal is 750 for the summer and i couldnt have done it without the anonymous donor
2961289 people come in all day and they play that game its very popular

2961300 will still be paying less than 1 a day for all their water and wastewater needs
2961301 no real increase in average household bills after 2010 the average bill for drinking water and sewerage will stay at around 390 per household or just over 1 a day before adding on general inflation

2961303 the taliban uses innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces

2961309 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2961310 i knew that he was going to be good we both came in together and left together and that was probably the win right there to be able to beat him off pit road once we did that i kind of got up through the esses better than him and we pulled away
2961311 it was a big hit for a bunch of guys
2961312 we were ready to attack i know with nine to go you get up on the wheel and push hard pushing and shoving is ok but that was crazy i guess there wasnt much place to go they kept pushing and shoving
2961313 we are committed to tackling knife crime and getting knives off our streets
2961314 we have introduced tough laws including increasing the minimum age at which someone can be sold a knife from 16 to 18 and penalties for shopkeepers who do beak the law
2961315 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve
2961316 enforcement action is one part of the solution and that is why i am today calling on our partners in the police and trading standards to get tough with anyone illegally selling knives to under 18s
2961317 for some time police forces have been working closely with trading standards to address the illegal sale of knives to young people
2961318 police forces are determined to make inroads into stamping out knife crime and getting weapons off our streets but this cannot be down to police alone retailers must take responsibility for their actions too
2961319 operations such as this are considered good practice in tackling unscrupulous and irresponsible shop keepers who are willing to sell knives to young people with the full knowledge that these may then go on to be used as weapons

2961353 belfasts belvoir park golf club has been chosen to host this fascinating event which will feature over 50 of the worlds top blind golfers from 13 countries competing for the title of world champion
2961354 members of the northern ireland blind golf association and belvoir park golf club should be congratulated for working tirelessly behind the scenes to secure this truly world class event in northern ireland for the first time
2961355 tournaments such as this showcase to the people of northern ireland and indeed further afield that having a disability need not be a barrier to participating in sport at all levels
2961356 later this year i hope to launch a sport and physical recreation strategy which will encourage all of us including people with disabilities to adopt a more active lifestyle
2961357 the last two championships were held in tokyo japan in 2006 and in melbourne australia in 2004 so its a special honour and something of a coup for europe and belfast to be chosen
2961358 it takes a pretty special game to carry such a lengthy title and be able to hold its head high amongst games with much shorter names
2961359 thankfully we dont have to worry about fitting this title on a package
2961360 i just want to clean the place up and make it look like a shopping center instead of a hitching post
2961361 the people who get the produce are the ones who often eat poorly and cant get fresh produce
2961362 when this came up eight years ago we thought it was something we could try and build each year and have fun while helping others less fortunate
2961363 we are expecting a response from dot prior to the scheduled public hearing
2961364 our concern is that this is in strong contrast to what was recommended to us
2961365 its important that responsible development be applied you can get the golden egg and kill the goose that laid it in the process we want to make sure that beautiful northwest guilford county is preserved
2961366 traffic is already a big issue on 68 edgefield and pleasant ridge roads plus were worried about northwest schools already being overcrowded and clear cutting of trees to build
2961367 our hope is to have the area treated like oak ridge rather than treated like high point
2961368 why do they need to develop more in our area when there is already plenty of space available elsewhere all within minutes of the airport
2961369 what we felt were compromise conditions they really didnt meet any of them except what they would have had to meet anyway we are extremely disappointed with their lack of earnest compromise
2961370 what happens here will set the bar on what happens in this area in the next few years
2961371 although i am very pleased to hear him listening to those around him i saw several quotes from school board members and parents who praised him for saying i dont know and not having a ready made plan
2961372 personally im all for a ready made plan that includes giving back more power to teachers and principals incorporating the community in the schools finding ulterior means for educating students more interested in disrupting schools than planning for their future preventing and not merely handling violence in schools and bringing back skill classes like shop keyboarding and home ec for students not on a traditional college track
2961373 while it was nice to hear that mr green didnt think he had all the answers i would have been more confident if he had a firm vision of direction for guilford county schools
2961374 hopefully this will come after his 100 days of listening mr green will have to stand up and be a leader and hold people accountable
2961375 i think his lack of specifics and plans may be his greatest strength
2961376 mr greens biggest challenge will be to overcome the morale and intimidation issues and the lack of trust that the grier years have heaped upon our teachers
2961377 we will have eight schools in each of nine regions across the united states
2961378 in about 20 years you will see a veritas national championship

2961381 software has become not just employee facing but also partner facing and even customer facing there is far less room for error in such applications or in any of the applications with which they integrate if you nail the release on the first try you avoid the outrageous expense of fixing problems in production and you can devote those funds to delivering new business functions
2961382 when it comes to delivering superior software development organizations are faced with a number of challenges code complexity pace of change and constrained resources to name just a few
2961383 software readiness manager provides development managers working in todays fast paced development environments with actionable data they need to help their teams deliver software that is fully prepared to perform in the field before it is released

2961397 we want to change peoples ideas of what immigrants are like

2961431 were trying to make social networking as much a part of mobile life as text messaging
2961432 with its unique combination of email and facebook our service is the simplest choice for those wishing to stay on top of their social life while theyre away from their computer
2961433 the complexity of setting up mobile applications on many phones is a great obstacle for most people so weve worked hard to make bluewhalemail childs play to setup
2961434 we are only at the initial concept stage but i can confirm that station hill 2 incorporates all the best elements of the original design striking tall buildings around a central public piazza but with a larger site to work with we can reduce the overall density and address some of the identified design issues in a nutshell it will be bigger and even better
2961435 like us the council is committed to the regeneration of station hill the new scheme will provide step free access right the way from friars walk to the new station concourse

2961438 y esto afectar directamente a los hoteles alquiler de coches restauraci n y ocio en general
2961439 no quiere que las agencias de viajes ofrezcan comparativas de precios y as evidenciar que en muchas ocasiones ryanair es la opci n m s cara
2961440 a ryanair nunca le ha gustado que le descubran sus trampas pero en edreams estamos dedicados a defender a nuestros clientes y evitar el enga o

2961443 investment in unproductive works is so widespread as to form part of the popular culture
2961444 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2961445 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
2961446 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
2961447 as i have already said because of those we hear saying that a nuclear attack by ir on il will be another holocaust thats the question i wanted to bring up i e how come such a hypotherical attack will be genocide and what the americans did wasnt
2961448 not at the level expected from a silicon valley startup
2961449 only very large enterprises could afford it and it was hard to justify paying those prices for a product that simply automated what developers could already do for themselves with free tools
2961450 when i go into sites i would love to turn them on to the benefits of the testng test framework
2961451 but most organizations do so little unit testing if any that i stick with the simple well known xunit tools so as not to create confusion most organizations are just not ready to learn anything more than basic unit testing if that
2961452 the problem with unit testing is that it increases the cost of development before you know whether what you developed is what you needed afterwards when you have a working solution theres little interest in writing unit tests as what you have works and your management wants you to move on
2961453 many developers and managers mistakenly think that by cutting testing they well get feature x out faster what they dont realize is that you are robbing peter to pay paul
2961454 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
2961455 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
2961456 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
2961457 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
2961458 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
2961459 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
2961460 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
2961461 in 1986 when marion countys thoroughbred industry was hit with tax law changes and farms were hit new industries came in to absorb those workers it hurt marion county but the county came out of it
2961462 its not business as usual this is not a traditional downturn that will all be ok when the housing market rebounds
2961463 these are new challenges and constraints on marion county that we havent seen before
2961464 it was a clear direction that god wanted to use me somewhere else
2961465 it adds additional capital and it also stabilizes our growth
2961466 what were trying to do is restructure to match the capital we have and the capital coming in
2961467 weve been looking to put a branch in that area
2961468 i dont feel i can give the job the full efforts
2961469 this is something we have been doing a lot of work with
2961470 it would be really great to see some of them completed and come about
2961471 they can bring them in which will give us an opportunity to look at them and make sure they dont have to make any corrections and that all the information is there and accurate
2961472 we just hold them until the 18th and then stamp them in
2961473 theres an introduction that i put in their packets that has a lot of information mainly about election law
2961474 when it happened before our lease was up so we moved and stumbled on this place and stood in the driveway and told the landlord why we were leaving the other place so they would understand
2961475 what do we do do you wait or do you start looking for another place
2961476 we dont have the money for another security deposit then first and last months rent
2961477 we cant put our finger on anything we used to think that construction ran animals out of their habitats but im not sure if thats the case anymore
2961478 all we can do is educate people and let them know rabies is higher this year
2961479 there are normally between 173 to 176 rabid animals per year
2961480 please get your pets vaccinated stay away from wild animals dont feed them dont leave food outside and if you see injured animals leave them alone
2961481 ma meglio non dire nulla perch anche lultima volta era cos e poi non ci siamo riusciti
2961482 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2961483 ufos and the national security state chronology of a cover up 1941 1973
2961484 it adds additional capital and it also stabilizes our growth
2961485 what were trying to do is restructure to match the capital we have and the capital coming in
2961486 weve been looking to put a branch in that area
2961487 most of the ones i see are in gainesville or jacksonville and i dont want to commute that far or relocate or they are sales positions based on commission and im looking for something more stable
2961488 i had a little bit of money when i got here in august of 2005 and by october 2005 i was out of money and had to get help from interfaith emergency services because the lights were off and we did not have food
2961489 i had a little savings and i do get child support
2961490 i dont have a lot of bills but i do have a mortgage
2961491 one thing i can bring to the table is the fact that i have been in the position to implement the policies brought by the school board
2961492 its not about treating all schools equally its about treating them all fairly
2961493 if one school needs four reading teachers give them four reading teachers because another school may only need two
2961494 because of that we need new out of the box ways of thinking to give our children high quality education for our children
2961495 i have my cell phone and people can contact me anytime
2961496 i am the director of training but that doesnt mean i must conduct all of the training in person
2961497 the sign of a good leader is the one who shows the ability to delegate
2961498 copyright law has abandoned its reason for being to encourage learning and the creation of new works instead its principal functions now are to preserve existing failed business models to suppress new business models and technologies and to obtain if possible enormous windfall profits from activity that not only causes no harm but which is beneficial to copyright owners like humpty dumpty the copyright law we used to know can never be put back together again multilateral and trade agreements have ensured that and quite deliberately
2961499 god made me fast and when i run i feel his pleasure
2961500 in a weeks time preliminary procedure for mnp seeking rfp from vendors will be out
2961501 we have cleared two of the three tracks and are clearing the long distance trains which were delayed after the blockage of tracks
2961502 its called a receptor because it interacts with a hormone in this case a hormone called gm csf
2961503 and when that happens it can cause uncontrolled growth and thats what cancer is about
2961504 at the moment many leukaemias are treated with chemotherapy that destroys the diseased blood cells and bone marrow as well as normal cells
2961505 we hope that this discovery will lead to targeted therapies more specific to the malfunctioning cells seen in diseases such as leukaemia
2961506 i think thats a real positive of this work it could target those diseases that are just untreatable at the moment or very difficult to treat
2961507 global partnership for development where do we stand and where to go
2961508 we were willing to accept even a 15 per cent trigger
2961509 by the time imports surged by 40 per cent small farmers would begin to commit suicide this was unacceptable to us
2961510 whatever is done from love always occurs beyond good and evil
2961511 in the end one loves ones desire and not what is desired
2961512 the best friend will probably acquire the best wife because a good marriage is founded on the talent for friendship
2961513 heaven is not a place its just an idea but its a very strong idea because if we didnt have it we wouldnt have any hope
2961514 madness is rare in individuals but in groups parties nations and ages it is the rule
2961515 he who does not know how to put his thoughts on ice ought not to enter into the heat of battle
2961516 if we live together with another person too closely what happens is similar to when we repeatedly handle a good engraving with our bare hands one day all we have left is a piece of dirty paper the soul of a human being too can finally become tattered by being handled continually and that is how it finally appears to us we never see the beauty of its original design again
2961517 never to speak about oneself is a very noble piece of hypocrisy talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself
2961518 das ist eine nicht akzeptable beeintr chtigung der arbeit von journalisten

2961530 we need to give our drivers time to take their families on vacation get their kids ready for school and work on their cars

2961546 outplaying the two time reigning european under 21 champions for much of the match the americans conceded sibons goal on a free kick that went under the wall after the netherlands had thrown four strikers forward in a desperate attempt to equalize
2961547 were completely confident that when were all on the same page like we were sunday were ready to play whoever
2961548 the americans lead group b with four points the same as nigeria but ahead on goals scored the dutch have two points and japan zero
2961549 moving holden would solve a tactical issue but not a personnel one nowak would still need to replace two midfielders and options there include derby countys benny feilhaber brescias danny szetela and fc dallas dax mccarty
2961550 well have time to think about that in the next couple of days
2961551 freddy and michael will not play but as ive said from the beginning its all about the group the 18 players weve chosen have to be up to the challenge
2961552 whatever decisions are made holden said dont expect the united states to play for a draw
2961553 you never want to go into a game looking for a draw or playing for a draw you get yourself in trouble that way
2961554 on one hole i lost my ball near a sewer when i couldnt find it i dropped a ball and gave myself a penalty stroke
2961555 there must be peace in the east and northern regions but the victims of such horrendous crimes must also get justice

2961635 i would be delighted for rio if he was made england captain
2961636 obviously i hope its rio as he is a team mate of mine and it would be great for the club
2961637 he is certainly the best defender in the club at the moment and it would be well deserved
2961638 but if it was one of the others then i wouldnt be too disappointed because the most important thing is to play and anything else is just a bonus
2961639 that was an exemplary performance he did not give one foul away and intercepted every ball that came towards him
2961640 he broke out of defence in comfort so many times it was unbelievable he is a magnificent player
2961641 he is almost 30 now and because he has experience his potential is now being fulfilled in a big way
2961642 i am sure we will find out in due course
2961643 of course it would be an honour but my main concern at the moment is manchester united help

2961678 ive fired 203 grenade rounds into windows through a door once but the thing i wish id seen i wish i could have seen a grenade go into someones body and blow it up you know what im saying
2961679 marines getting baptized this used to be a place of men with pure warrior spirit chaplains are a goddamn waste
2961680 trying to rock that humvee out with dill in the back seat his foot blown off
2961681 one universal fact of being in the marine corps is that no matter where we go in the world we always end up in some random shitty place
2961682 no other military in the world can do what we do
2961683 yeah well we still did a lot of stupid shit
2961684 if we get shot at it means we failed the enemy is never supposed to see us were the most highly trained marines in the corps the way they used us in this war its like they took a ferrari and put it in a demolition derby we did ok but we didnt sign up for this
2961685 combat is the supreme adrenaline rush you take rounds shoot back shit starts blowing up its sensory overload its the one thing thats not over rated in the military
2961686 i cant believe im getting paid to work out dip and hang out with the best guys in the world
2961687 jump in drive that bitch off with the car alarm going nobodys going to stop you nobodys going to even look at you he says
2961688 you know why nobody gives a fuck in my line of work that was the key to everything the only people that will fuck you up are dogooders i cant stand do gooders luckily theres not too many of those
2961689 war doesnt change anything this place was fucked up before we came and its fucked up now i personally dont believe we liberated the iraqis time will tell
2961690 those idiots dont they realize the world already hates us
2961691 bam a lam a lam a shoo bop de bop de bop
2961692 then we let him go and he spends the next twelve years pissing us off even more we dont want to be in this shit hole country we dont want to invade it what a fucking retard
2961693 what i look for in the people i want on the battlefield are not specific job titles but courage and initiative
2961694 dont you think you ought to change out of your pajamas
2961695 we lived in a trailer for a few years on my grandpas farm and id get one pair of shoes a year from wal mart
2961696 id planned to go to vanderbilt on a scholarship and study philosophy
2961697 but i had an epiphany one day i wanted to do my life for a while rather than think it
2961698 what does this say on my shirt u s marine i wasnt born on some hippie faggot commune im a death dealing killer in my free time i do push ups until my knuckles bleed then i sharpen my knife
2961699 im going to get a flock of seagulls haircut then im going to become a rock star
2961700 you dont want to ever show fear or back down because you dont want to be embarrassed in front of the pack
2961701 one of those fantasy things you always hoped would really happen
2961702 its up to me to carry on the trombley name
2961703 make sure you dont shoot the civilians we are an invading army we must be magnanimous
2961704 all it takes is one dumb guy in charge to ruin everything
2961705 every time he steps out of the vehicle i pray he gets shot
2961706 shit my brains out not too hard not too runny
2961707 that sucks when its runny and you have to wipe fifty times
2961708 if its too hard or too soft somethings not right you might have a problem
2961709 maybe on your little bitch asshole from all the cock thats been stuffed up it
2961710 man the marines are so homoerotic thats all we talk about
2961711 hey if you lay down with your cock on the ground it feels good
2961712 anyone with a weapon is declared hostile if its a woman walking away from you with a weapon on her back shoot her
2961713 and this time i get to do what ive always wanted to do in t j
2961714 hey you think i have enough driving hours now to get my humvee license
2961715 you know that feeling before a debate when you gotta piss and youve got that weird feeling in your stomach then you go in and kick ass
2961716 that fag justin timberlake will make a soundtrack for it
2961717 i just read that all these pussy faggot pop stars like justin timberlake and britney spears were going to make an anti war song when i become a pop star im just going to make pro war songs
2961718 our job is to kamikaze into the city and collect casualties
2961719 theyre not there yet were the reaction force for an attack thats coming across the bridge we go in during the fight to pick up the wounded
2961720 man i pulled my trousers down and it smells like hot dick that sweaty hot cock smell i kind of smell like i just had sex
2961721 it doesnt mean youre gay if you think rudys hot hes just so beautiful
2961722 i asked a priest if its ok to kill people in war
2961723 he said its ok as long as you dont enjoy it before we crossed into iraq i fucking hated arabs i dont know why but as soon as we got here its just gone i just feel sorry for them i miss my little girl i dont want to kill anybodys children
2961724 one kid will cost you 300 000 you should never have gotten married its always a mistake
2961725 women will always cost you money but marriage is the most expensive way to go if you want to pay for it trombley go to australia for a hundred bucks you can order a whore over the phone half an hour later she arrives at your door fresh and hot like a pizza
2961726 theyre one of those couples that likes to takes pictures of themselves doing all the fun things they do and hang them up all over their goddamn house sometimes i just go over there and look at the pictures of my ex fianc e doing all those fun things i used to do with her its nice having friends
2961727 no matter what you see were in backcountry now and were all alone
2961728 i really thank god i was born american i mean seriously its something i lose sleep over
2961729 i bet colberts really happy to be finally shooting a 203 round in combat
2961730 holy shit did you see that we got fucking lit up
2961731 i got one sergeant his knee exploded then i cut him in half
2961732 fuck no im not thermiting anything were driving this out of here
2961733 i just loaded and fired my weapon from muscle memory i wasnt even aware what my hands were doing
2961734 the good news is we will be rolling with a lot of ass today rct 1 will be in front of us for most of the day the bad news is were going through four more towns like the one we hit yesterday
2961735 my dad was once the dog bit him and my dad jammed his hand down his throat and ripped up his stomach i did have a dog lunge at me once on the sidewalk i just threw it on its side knocked the wind out of him
2961736 i had a cat that lived to be sixteen one time he ripped a dogs eye out with his claw
2961737 jesus christ theres fucking civilians in that house cease fire
2961738 everyones just tense some marine took a shot and everyone has just followed suit
2961739 those were fucking doctors who do nose and tit jobs
2961740 i think i got one of those iraqis too i saw him go down
2961741 yeah but you killed a camel too and wounded another one
2961742 dont put this on trombley im responsible for this it was my orders
2961743 im going to have to bring this home with me and live with it
2961744 pilots dont see what they do when they drop bombs we do
2961745 is this going to be ok i mean with the investigation
2961746 i dont care what happens really im out in a couple of years i mean for you this is your career
2961747 a lot of the young men i talk to can compartmentalize the terrible things theyve seen
2961748 but many of them feel bad because they havent had a chance to fire their weapons they worry that they havent done their jobs as marines
2961749 the zeal these young men have for killing surprises me
2961750 when i first heard them talk so easily about taking human lives using such profane language it instilled in me a sense of disbelief and rage people here think jesus is a doormat
2961751 we might go to the iranian border to interdict smugglers
2961752 after they sewed his dick back on didnt he make porn movies where he fucked a midget
2961753 it may be a possibility that the commander wants some of us to die so when he sits around with other leaders they dont snicker at him and ask what kind of shit he got into yeah thats the suspicion around here
2961754 i dont like nothing about combat i dont like the shooting i dont like the action
2961755 i didnt want some piece of paper from the white master saying i was qualified to function in his world
2961756 i was getting shot at making chump change so i could protect the assets of a bunch of rich white bankers
2961757 every morning i think im going to die for what so some colonel can make general by throwing us into another firefight
2961758 we get a few random shots and we fire back with such overwhelming force that we stomp them i call it disciplining the hajjis
2961759 we could have gone farther bombs fell in areas we didnt get to see but i believe they didnt want us to investigate too much and find out possibly that wed hit homes or civilians or just nothing at all
2961760 that iraqi rocket system kills everything in an entire grid square
2961761 they knew our coordinates and came within a few hundred meters of us we got lucky again
2961762 were following the al gharraf canal doing a movement to contact
2961763 women are always the fiercest doesnt matter if its a black bitch in south central or a rich white bitch in beverly hills they always come after you screaming
2961764 but deep down inside i want to know what it feels like to get shot not that i want to get shot but the reality is i feel more nervous watching a game show on tv at home than i do here in all this
2961765 all this stupidity is making me want to kill myself
2961766 just the same i want to be with these guys so i can do what i can to help them live
2961767 this country is dirty and nasty and the sooner we are out of here the better
2961768 i feel like for the first time we seized the initiative
2961769 i felt cold blooded as a motherfucker shooting those guys that popped out of the truck
2961770 whatever last shred of humanity i had before i came here its gone
2961771 i could see her throat from the top of her skull
2961772 thats why i fucking cant stand mexico i hate third world countries
2961773 the u s should just go into all these countries here and in africa and set up a u s government and infrastructure with mcdonalds starbucks mtv then just hand it over if we have to kill 100 000 to save 20 million its worth it
2961774 hell the u s did it at home for 200 years killed indians used slaves exploited immigrant labor to build a system thats good for everybody today what does the white man call it manifest destiny
2961775 i just saw seven people vaporized right before my very eyes
2961776 the bad news is we wont get much sleep tonight
2961777 i think the chances of a serious threat are low
2961778 i care a lot about these guys and i dont like the idea of sending them into something where somebody isnt going to come back
2961779 the people running this can fuck things up all they want but as long as we keep getting lucky and making it through alive theyll just keep repeating the same mistakes
2961780 look at that skinny ass dude youd never guess what a bad motherfucker he is
2961781 i thought he had no friends hes such a loner
2961782 but he just cant stand people even me im only his friend to piss him off but the dude is a straight up warrior
2961783 weve been brainwashed and trained for combat we must say kill 3 000 times a day in boot camp thats why its easy
2961784 that dude i saw crawling last night i shot him in the grape saw the top of his head bust off that didnt feel good it makes me sick
2961785 i would have done anything to save that kid but i couldnt give a fuck about those guys i just killed its like youre supposed to feel fucked after killing people i dont
2961786 we should never be in a position like this again that was bad tactics
2961787 whatever he was doing he was not being in command
2961788 these guys look like foreign university students in new york
2961789 saddam offered these men land money and wives to come and fight for him
2961790 the iraqis expected us to go all the way through al kut that the dumb marines would fight their way through the worst terrain to baghdad
2961791 im not a great general i was just up against other generals who dont know shit
2961792 this part of the world would be better off without us
2961793 it almost makes you lose your sanity the fear of dying will make you lose your sanity
2961794 but to remain calm and stay in a place where you think you will die that is the definition of insane too you must become insane to survive in combat
2961795 these are good up close weapons for firing from a vehicle
2961796 we were all pissed because sergeant patrick had just been shot and i wanted to shoot that guy but that would have given away our position
2961797 he just wants to overdramatize everything so he feels like more of a hero
2961798 he jumps over me and jams him in chest with his bayonet he turned the situation into chaos
2961799 if something happens to me i want my wife to know the truth because of guys like captain america weve fought retarded
2961800 if id wanted to kill him i would have shot him by stabbing him i saved his life
2961801 ive heard theyre speaking pretty highly of first recon at division headquarters

2961804 bindras remarkable achievement will inspire other indian athletes to perform excellently in the remaining parts of the olympics
2961805 on the podium the chinese man was crying while today india is laughing
2961806 its a great day in the history of indian sports finally we got an individual gold
2961807 cricket rules the roost in india but now the youngsters have a role model who plays some other sport

2961810 i am honoured to have been asked by the norwegian guard to perform the promotion ceremony for nils i understand he continues to carry out his duties as honorary colonel in an exemplary fashion and this latest award is clearly very much deserved
2961811 we are extremely proud of nils olav and pleased that an enduring part of the royal guard is resident in scotland helping to further strengthen ties between our two countries
2961812 i am extremely delighted and proud to hear today that you have realized the dream of a billion of our people by winning the olympic gold medal in the 10 metre air rifle event in beijing
2961813 your achievement today should inspire confidence amongst all indian sportspersons that they can achieve the pinnacle of any sport at the international level it should also be an inspiration for more of our youth to take up sports as a full time career
2961814 now i have lots of work ahead as he is the countrys most eligible bachelor
2961815 its the thrill of my life thats about it i just went for it i knew i was lying fourth

2961817 meldet itar tass eine entsprechende bitte erging an au enministerin rice gestern hatte ein anonymer mitarbeiter des amerikanischen au enministeriums erkl rt georgien trage einen teil der verantwortung am s dossetischen konflikt
2961818 durch den beschuss der kasernen der russichen friedenstruppen durch georgische sicherheitskr fte sind mehr als zehn unserer soldaten ums leben gekommen etwa 30 wurden verletzt
2961819 wir verstehen die situation wie auch immer es in s dossetien ausgehen mag die n chste etappe k nnte abchasien sein darum m ssen wir besondere ma nahmen treffen je nachdem wie sich die lage in zchinwali entwickelt werden wir handeln
2961820 es findet praktisch ein genozid und die vernichtung s dossetiens statt
2961821 wie schwer die lage auch ist das leben jedes einzelnen menschen ist f r uns wertvoll darum hat sich die georgische seite entschieden f r drei stunden 15 18 uhr das feuer einzustellen unter der voraussetzung dass es von anderer seite keine attacken gibt
2961822 we have a challenge for you i hope you can help us we have a one year old border collie named zippy she is very active and we do a lot of play and exercise with her our problem is that every time we are in the kitchen opening the silverware drawer or any drawer that makes noises she goes crazy she runs around in circles bolts to our living room and then makes more circles
2961823 its a wonderful event you can decry it for its foolishness but its huge all over the world they lap it up in australia for instance it has a global audience of some 300 million we adore the competitive element and the voting but above all in this country we love the eurovision song contest because its the ideal opportunity to have a jolly good sneer at johnny foreigner and throw things at the telly you cant beat that sort of entertainment
2961824 as you enter the theatre for eurobeat youre given a country to represent and you cant vote for that nation mind you if youre from scandinavia or the balkans you might take an entirely different view
2961825 you get a great flavour of the fun and the enthusiasm of the real eurovision song contest when it goes out on tv people up and down the country hold parties and hoot at all the contestants did you know that last year it got 11 million viewers in the uk
2961826 most people in this country watch the contest with their tongues very firmly in their cheeks ive trained them
2961827 like the rest of europe members of the eurovision song contest fan club take it very seriously indeed
2961828 they used to get annoyed but now they see that what im doing is good natured i dont make the mistake of thinking its a major musical event having said that in most european countries i still have to go incognito and if i turned up at a performance of eurobeat id probably have to wear a paper bag on my head
2961829 i love the eurovision song contest and it will continue long after im gone
2961830 kali terakhir saya bercakap dengannya ialah selepas suami solat isyak di surau flet ini malam rabu lalu
2961831 kami berbual seperti biasa sebelum allahyarham memberitahu tidak kira apa yang berlaku dia tidak akan meninggalkan saya dan anak anak
2961832 saya percayakan kata katanya kerana sejak mendirikan rumah tangga allahyarham tidak pernah mengabaikan tanggungjawabnya sebagai suami dan bapa
2961833 sekarang saya tak tahu apa yang perlu dikatakan kepada noor amelia dan mohd nurul aiman yang sering bertanyakan kenapa ayah mereka tidak pulang kerana kedua duanya manja dengannya
2961834 kini saya turut bimbangkan masa depan keluarga kerana selama ini hanya dia tempat kami bergantung

2961839 fled into a neighboring compound where they held 11 non combatants hostage including several children and an infant
2961840 the taliban uses innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
2961841 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
2961842 its hard to calculate but its possible that hot money is leaving china because of that

2961848 and you will serve there the nations that worship idols
2961849 when you have children and have grown old in the land and you will make a statue and do that which is evil in the eyes of hashem your god you will be swiftly removed from the land and hashem will disperse you among the nations and you will serve there man made gods

2961859 i have taught you to follow the commandments in the midst of the land
2961860 h r r butiken du inte bara tittar h r ska du smaka
2961861 the key elements of this equities rebound are the drop in both the euro and oil prices even the ecb seems to finally recognise that the recession in europe is just around the corner
2961862 the us economy is already getting better while europes is plunging with hopes of rate cuts the euro is falling boosting the u s dollar which prompts a retreat in oil prices
2961863 enrc has also been very highly correlated to the russian market recently
2961864 the collection and recycling results of old electronic equipment over the last three years show that significant volumes of material have now safely been recycled and diverted from landfill
2961865 recycling levels of larger items such as fridges and cookers have been very good however the take back of smaller items such as adapters chargers cables and headphones could be much better
2961866 people tend to hoard these items and forget about them therefore we would encourage people to clear out the drawers attics and sheds and bring all old equipment including batteries to their local recycling centre
2961867 mabuti na ang senate through senator biazon made that suggestion kaya sabi niya moratorium muna wala munang magsasalita na senador kapag hindi natin masyadong sinulsulan ang sitwasyon di na kakalat iyan its good the senate through senator biazon made that suggestion so he said lets have a moratorium first let no senator speak if we dont stoke the situation further the trouble will not spread
2961868 of course the purpose of the cabinet is to help the president were just following directions from the president we dont want the situation to escalate or worsen because this is our country after all
2961869 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2961870 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2961871 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2961872 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2961873 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2961874 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2961875 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2961876 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2961877 we were fast in germany last year but this year we have a new car on new tyres and the first rally on tarmac so its hard to know where we are speed wise the test there went well though and if we can carry the same form we had last year it would be good
2961878 it was great in finland to get a podium as our first points score with the new car as it does build confidence the more time you spend in the car the more confident you get with it
2961879 we will go there pushing hard and get a gauge of our performance and then see how we go from there but im looking forward to it
2961880 maar dat is bij een eerste keer altijd als je in snelle dingen gaat nu zou ik nog wel een keer durven maar helaas het geld is op
2961881 als ik wat jonger zou zijn zou ik het waarschijnlijk ook uitgeprobeerd hebben op de kermis zoek je spanning en sensatie en die vind je hier wel we hebben daarnet op het terras gezeten en dan zie je altijd bekenden dat is het leuke van de kermis
2961882 het begin is wat rustig geweest we hebben wat meer volk nodig als het nu wat langer droog blijft dan gaan de mensen wel komen ik ben echt niet somber want de sfeer is goed
2961883 ik genoot met volle teugen van het leven op het podium maar daarbuiten had ik weinig vaak stond ik avond na avond op de planken en had geen tijd voor vrienden en familie
2961884 televisiewerk is vaak overdag nu heb ik tijd om s avonds eens met een vriendin naar de film te gaan
2961885 en tijd voor mijn vriendje martin we zijn sinds twee maanden verliefd het is nog pril maar ik heb nu wel de tijd en ruimte om in deze relatie te investeren
2961886 levi van kempen joris putman en anouk van kooijk mijn medehoofdrolspelers en ik mogen niet weten welke acteur er in het pak van eddie zit om het voor ons extra spannend te maken
2961887 geloof mij binnen een week weet ik wie het is ik neem een fototoestel mee om hem backstage te fotograferen en ga zijn kleedkamer doorzoeken want ik kan het natuurlijk niet uitstaan dat ik niet mag weten voor wie ik op de vlucht ben
2961888 in januari ga ik hoogstwaarschijnlijk ook weer het theater in het is geen musical je moet meer denken aan een soort concert maar daar kan ik verder nog niets over verklappen omdat het nog niet helemaal rond is of ik musicals heb afgezworen nee hoor helemaal niet over een tijdje zou graag weer in een mooie productie spelen maar ik vind het op dit moment wel heerlijk om te zingen en te acteren en gelijk ook tijd te hebben voor vrienden en familie en voor mijn vriend martin natuurlijk want we hebben het echt heel leuk samen
2961889 the constituents of district 39 should have the opportunity to elect who they want to represent them
2961890 you cant complain too much when you score four goals away from home and i knew it would be a tough match but i didnt think we would concede that many goals
2961891 we were hoping that it would not be that close and dramatic
2961892 after the early goal we were hoping we would be able to cruise but we learned a lesson that you cant relax even against a third division team we still have a lot of work ahead of us
2961893 nani has gone through the same process as all the young players and you are looking for that jump up in performance level from the first season
2961894 his maturity should be better as well which is important
2961895 he is a very young 20 that immaturity showed itself against west ham at the end of the season that has cost us because he is missing for the first two games
2961896 but when he develops that he will be an outstanding talent he has courage and speed can play with both feet and does not melt in big atmospheres
2961897 then fled into a neighboring compound where they held 11 noncombatants hostage including several children and an infant
2961898 the taliban uses innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
2961899 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors

2961991 about what the company intends to do with your data and your information
2961992 that is why congress at this point is wanting to gather a lot more information because no one knows
2961993 that information is incredibly valuable its the new frontier of advertising
2961994 we can understand exactly what each sector of the communications industry is technically capable of doing and how they use the information once they do get access to it
2961995 we dont have any raw data on the identifiable individual
2961996 the results highlighted the resilience of xps end markets and business model
2961997 management does have to focus on controlling input price increases but the outlook statement and its book to bill ratio support our unchanged full year forecasts the shares look significantly undervalued in a sector where industry consolidation will continue to be a major feature

2962040 when the female condom first came to us it was marketed to sex workers women in bars and other women thought to be at high risk of hiv or to have loose morals
2962041 as a result women who thought they were safe such as married women were and still are reluctant to use it
2962042 even here at the conference the bag supplied by the conference organizers to all delegates contained five male condoms but only one female condom
2962043 the male condom was promoted so hard in advertising through school education and advocacy we need the same effort for the female condom
2962044 they have felt more confident assertive and fulfilled in their sexuality

2962126 the trade and industry ministry and treasury warned me that importing those books is illegal
2962127 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2962128 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2962129 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2962130 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally
2962131 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2962132 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2962133 the georgian gambit of trying to push the russians out of its breakaway border territories seems to have had the opposite effect of consolidating russian control
2962134 its still unclear whether this crisis can be contained with only the destruction and loss of life it has caused so far
2962135 but i firmly believe if i dont vote i dont have a right to complain
2962136 at this point i have to choose the lesser of two evils
2962137 maybe its the whim of the moment or based on definite reasons but there are always flip floppers
2962138 well have to see what events make them settle out
2962139 i just dont like the conservative side of the republican party right now
2962140 i like john mccain and i like what he stands for but i feel he has basically kind of sided with the conservatives too much
2962141 im a firm believer from my college days that you vote for the candidate for who serves your best interests
2962142 i still believe that but now i believe the democrats are looking to the future and are on the right footing
2962143 i always said if hillary didnt make it id have to go for mccain
2962144 im not going to say obama wouldnt be good in time
2962145 but right now he doesnt have enough experience to handle the country
2962146 more than 50 russian warplanes are flying over georgia tbilisi was bombed bombs hit the village of kojori and makhata mountain
2962147 there were several attacks on the kodori gorge all of them repelled
2962148 gori is being bombed massively from the air and from artillery as well
2962149 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2962150 in certain zones near tskhinvali russian peacekeepers met active confrontation
2962151 we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides
2962152 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of noncombatants in the buildings at that time

2962171 its important for the students to start connecting to their peers
2962172 letting go a parents guide to understanding the college years
2962173 but if you plan to have a special family gathering have it ahead of time
2962174 they want this for their child but this is the price they pay for the childs success some struggle with not wanting to lose that intimate connection
2962175 grieving the loss of that phase of his life and my life
2962176 just being a worrier is a part of it not being able to know what hes up to all the time
2962177 but thats the way it should be he should be on his own but its just not being able to be his protector which im not anyway but i have the illusion i still am
2962178 i think the most important thing is for parents to realize that their emotions and their mixed feelings are normal and not to lose sight of what an incredible opportunity and privilege it is to send a child to college
2962179 the other thing i think is for parents to realize this relationship and their role doesnt end it just changes there is incredible joy in being able to talk to your child whos discovering new worlds and learn from your child
2962180 i think that if you stop and think about it if students are going way to residential college they are leaving behind all kinds of services support and people whove been involved in their lives
2962181 with the proper preparation they can make arrangements to have many of those supports
2962182 part of the transition is how we help them be involved in what skidmore college is
2962183 but what they need to do is work out with their child how theyre going to maintain this relationship theyre used to total involvement and total control over some of the decision making now they have to renegotiate all that we as the college can help with some of that but a lot of it is the work they have to do to renegotiate this relationship
2962184 its tempting for parents to give lectures but what makes more sense is to engage in a dialogue what are you looking forward to what are you anxious about almost all parents as well as the students have ambivalence about these things even the student who says i cant wait to get out of this house out of this town will i make friends will i fit in theyre very excited about the new freedom but in my experience talking to high school seniors theyre nervous about how to handle that freedom having parents engage in this kind of discussions with daughters and sons can be helpful
2962185 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2962186 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2962187 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2962188 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2962189 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2962190 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2962191 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

2962227 i felt with the personnel we had missing today that if we went toe to toe with them we could have got exposed quite badly so i picked a formation that i thought would frustrate keith and in the first half we limited their chances
2962228 apart from when they got behind us for the goal i felt as the first and second half progressed you could see we were frustrating them we did get a break and perhaps should have scored and then with 10 minutes to go i took a gamble and went 4 4 2 we got a bit exposed and they got their second

2962250 and hes an amiable bloke when youre with him that said i dont think we agree on much but he seems like a cool guy
2962251 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
2962252 this election is about not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
2962253 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
2962254 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
2962255 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named
2962256 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
2962257 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
2962258 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
2962259 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about
2962260 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
2962261 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things

2962268 it was perfect it was the ideal race ive been looking forward to these olympics for so long
2962269 i went in with a relaxed feeling and saved some energy for the final push it went exactly as i planned
2962270 you have to tip your hat to a guy who can race like that
2962271 its a hell of a swim in a pressure packed race hes a true champion
2962272 it was really good fun it was really exciting it was a good experience but you know it wasnt the best that weve dived and it was a bit disappointing
2962273 ive got that experience now so i think that if i were to do that again id do it better
2962274 ive got my nerves out of the way so ive got rid of some of the cobwebs
2962275 it was great fun out there everythings been amazing this olympics
2962276 i harvested my first moose when i was 18 a couple of years ago
2962277 it wasnt a huge trophy moose but it was a trophy to me i was able to go hunting with my dad and he was there when i shot it
2962278 i grew up hunting and fishing with my dad and that did involve moose hunting back in alaska
2962279 i definitely think my hunting background and my growing up in alaska helped me progress so quickly and make this team after only shooting international trap for just two years
2962280 theres really just no denying it amd has truly impressed us with the hd 4870 it easily rips through the latest games without ripping through the wallet and has really stirred things up in the market if youre in the market for a powerful card this summer you just cant go wrong with the amd radeon hd 4870
2962281 just a few weeks ago the radeon hd 4850 was released and with it came a huge boost of performance for the price
2962282 this is a turning point i think in the next 12 or 15 months that were going to make history were going to allow the nation of iraq to build itself
2962283 i believe that we can have success in iraq that it is possible
2962284 a positive attitude may not solve all your problems but it will
2962285 it is realized that the league is incapable of rendering material aid and that the moral influence which may be a powerful force with civilized countries is unlikely to make any impression upon soviet russia
2962286 while america considers georgia its strongest ally in the bloc of former soviet countries washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia
2962287 it was that democrats are united around a commitment to provide every american access to affordable comprehensive health care
2962288 should have the option of keeping the coverage they have or choosing from a wide array of health insurance plans including many private health insurance options and a public plan
2962289 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia

2962292 its hoped this small experiment will show how australian seeds respond to microgravity and ionising radiation perhaps demonstrating they are the toughest on earth and in space
2962293 this nasa experiment could even lead to some ground breaking research by providing a preliminary evaluation of space station seedbanking a possible option for the future
2962294 great advances in science are often the result of unexpected results sending native seeds into space may open up whole new research areas or it may confirm that we are already doing the best we can to conserve our seed for future needs
2962295 perhaps more importantly i hope this short trip into space for some aussie seeds will raise awareness of seedbanking as an insurance policy for the future
2962296 this provides an insurance policy for species that might become extinct due to global warming or other changes to their habitat
2962297 with habitats under increasing threat conservation seedbanking is an important strategy for both storing and understanding genetically important wild seeds as part of a global seed conservation effort botanic gardens trust is a partner in the millennium seed bank project based in the uk

2962313 die unterschiede werden immer gr er aber die politik reagiert nicht darauf
2962314 in jedem neuen schuljahr kommen auf die eltern kosten von 100 bis 300 euro zu bei der einschulung und beim schulwechsel sind die betr ge am h chsten
2962315 das hat die stadt nun gestoppt indem sie hartz iv empf ngern zus tzliches geld f r schulmittel als darlehen bewilligt
2962316 die stadt hat damit verhindert dass wir eine grundsatzentscheidung bei dem thema bekommen

2962320 were seeing world records get broken like its the easiest thing in the world and its not everyones swimming fast everyones got a smile on his face and its been fun so far
2962321 i thought i had a shot all the way to the wall
2962322 i had two races where i had to be in the top eight where everybody was racing hard in the preliminaries at this point i take one race at a time you cant think about the next until you get there

2962325 i dont want to be the center of attention going into the final
2962326 i dont swim well when im the center of attention
2962327 ive just had a really off year on a really important year and i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me
2962328 im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
2962329 young people are missing out they are doing better than ever in science tests at 14 but hardly any are going on to study triple science gcse despite the opportunities and learning it offers
2962330 parents want the best for their children and they need to understand that triple science provides just that science skills gained today can be the pathway to a great career tomorrow it is essential that all our children have the chance of the best possible science education if they are to enjoy the employment opportunities of the future
2962331 application of advanced science and technology has never been more important to the energy industry there are great careers available in making sure the world has the energy it needs and in tackling climate change incentives for more children to take science at school could help produce the next generations of scientists and engineers that our industry really needs
2962332 i strongly endorse the idea of encouraging more children to take triple combined science rather than the less comprehensive single or double science gcse
2962333 we never stop looking for ways to improve the action
2962334 the two pit stops in the feature race have proved to be the high pressure points of the events and we felt an additional one would add another variable to the sprint race
2962335 im looking forward to having more races as is planned for the future
2962336 actually the tests have been reduced quite a lot over the last two or three years but i hope we have more races because there isnt one that i dont like
2962337 im looking forward to going to india and the other interesting new places currently being discussed
2962338 its a pity that indianapolis isnt on the calendar because for me the formula one world championship should race everywhere in the world

2962426 i met someone else quite a while ago now a hero someone whose entire life is dedicated to saving people who does whatever it takes and he changed me gave me a purpose i cant ever go back now and trust me if i thought that there was even one chance in a million that youd ever change too id let you be on my team do you do you get that

2962431 that is you if with a more gaudy dress sense guess youve got a double in this dimension
2962432 is he any good with the weapons or are they just for show
2962433 well thats something at least even if he is a poofter
2962434 as if hed ever settle for just one sex not to mention just one species
2962435 well apparently hell do anything that moves i saw him check out a poodle
2962436 ok vampire here pretty much wrote the book on deviant but a poodle
2962437 im guessing your ex wasnt a demon in the literal sense eh
2962438 vampire undead bloodsucking creature of the night guess you must have heard of them yeah dracula ring a bell well hes real back where we come from owes me eleven quid the tight narcissistic bastard
2962439 according to the scanner hes dead theres no heartbeat no pulse no anything
2962440 who needs words i was thinking of making a painting or something i could call it pieta
2962441 always were a blasphemer angel anyway ill just tell her that youve gone evil again and then watch as she stakes you cant laugh when youre dust blowing in the wind
2962442 still the funniest thing ive ever seen you know i think it even beats andrews big reunion speech
2962443 what could it be about you that makes all the boys go wild spike
2962444 oh violence now the last resort of the man with no defence hey should we warn the poor mothers of cardiff lock up your sons spike is in town
2962445 captain spike has a certain ring to it dont you think
2962446 did you also forget that you killed a man for that title
2962447 i was wondering if well weve never come across vampires before wed be very grateful if youd come back to our base so we could do some tests maybe
2962448 right of course were going to meekly follow the secret government organisation that wants to do experiments on us i dont think so ive been a lab rat once and ill be damned if im bloody walking into the lions mouth of my own free will
2962449 he llo tell me gorgeous what planet are you from
2962450 this world is a parallel universe to our own our quest is uncertain here
2962451 oh and flashheart shes not an alien shes a god
2962452 good to know that blackadder is around here as well eh baldrick
2962453 a few years ago i represented every major hollywood star
2962454 still think you should have done away with tom cruise when you had the chance
2962455 time is wasted we shall leave i am not entirely sure how we ended up here
2962456 the inter dimensional sat nav drove us off a cliff did it
2962457 it reminds me of the hellhounds that were kept in my courts in the realm of despair
2962458 its an alien we call them weevils but we know nothing about them except that they can be extremely vicious
2962459 illyria just bloody kill it already ok its far more trouble than its worth even if it is an alien
2962460 are you sure we should let them go arent vampires you know evil
2962461 not these two reformed you see actually heres my card
2962462 spike full time champion and saviour of the world excuse me i mean john tried to pull some fast ones but this is in a league of its own
2962463 youre the one who started talking about heroes told you i knew what you were on about and please call off your little friends being shot hurts like hell actually that reminds me
2962464 there keep it as a souvenir should have some vampire dna on it or whatever youre after
2962465 wait please come with us just for a little while promise we wont do any crazy experiments if you really are heroes then i dont know you could help us we have several artefacts that maybe you could classify and i know that one of my colleagues would love to take a look at that rift opening ability you seem to have
2962466 what do you mean rift shes creating a portal or is this just different terminology
2962467 um there is a rift in time and space here all sorts of things come through it thought thats how you came here too
2962468 dunno but it could be i mean considering how many items were stored in sunnydale
2962469 very well lead the way capn oh and if you try to lock me up or put anything in my head youll share the weevils fate ok
2962470 excuse me sir but are you sure about this theyre clearly dangerous
2962471 when captain john turned up we all nearly ended up dead because of your attachment forgive me for being cautious
2962472 trust me pretty boy if we wanted to kill you youd be dead already however we have a strict policy of saving humans not killing them and dont get all worked up over your bosss crush i am not interested in any threesomes actually not interested full stop ive already got one tall broody bloke in my life really not wanting any more
2962473 look the organisation was founded by queen victoria cant really go changing the name now
2962474 brilliant woman met her once when i was a boy highlight of the year that was
2962475 when you were a boy are you a timetraveller too
2962476 um no but i was born in 1853 died 1880
2962477 spike please come here and stand next to me ill back for the rest of you in a moment
2962478 nice now i have spent a lot of time in sewers but this is something else
2962479 bloody hell this things slow look ill just jump down and you can go back for angel trust me hell be tearing up the concrete in a minute
2962480 only word for word what captain john hart said when we first met same inflection same look same everything
2962481 is she by any chance a recently deceased brilliant scientist who happens to own a giant diamond
2962482 shes a slayer which means that she kills nasty things with big shiny weapons has died twice by the way since you ask but is just as gorgeous as ever and very much alive and shes blonde well not a natural one
2962483 thinking about it then my first girlfriend was a brunette and we never lacked for fun in the 120 years we were together maybe the blonde thing is just about aesthetics
2962484 you were with someone for one hundred and twenty years
2962485 vampire here immortal and all that didnt we cover this already
2962486 no no i mean you were with one woman for all that time
2962487 ye es loved her to pieces would have done and did anything for her then of course i met buffy and we get that whole meeting a hero and changing long story cut short etcetera
2962488 but you loved her and now you love this buffy
2962489 whats so friggin weird about that dont you have love in this dimension
2962490 used to be a poet hopeless romantic lets women wrap him around their little finger
2962491 captain john believed life to be basically pointless with money and casual sex as the only consolation
2962492 hey angel remember when you cut off that necromancers head with a tray
2962493 haynes his name was haynes and how could i forget
2962494 and as i said shes a god if she gets mad shell smite you mark my words
2962495 our dimension was once upon a time a demon realm when humans took over they ousted the demons more or less but some of them called the old ones who were incredibly powerful had themselves preserved illyrias followers brought her back a few years ago but her world conquering plans fell through
2962496 this is but a mere shell wholly inadequate for showcasing my true splendor but your admiration is somewhat gratifying mortal in its own insignificant way
2962497 oh yes but i cant die or rather i always come back to life
2962498 i died and came back once well ive done it twice but the second time was a hell of a lot more painfull still
2962499 try living when you dont even have the power to touch
2962500 hey what about pavayne think hes still stuck in that box
2962501 should think so he was way down in the basement could probably survive a nuclear war
2962502 so would you like a tour before tosh and owen attack you with all sorts of scanners and needles maybe a bit to eat actually im starving think weve got some chinese still and a couple of pizzas
2962503 chinese sounds good but not really our thing do you have some blood
2962504 what you spend your lives cutting up aliens or goodness knows what but you get queasy over a little blood
2962505 hey hes used to it its only a few weeks since i got him stabbed through the chest oh and if you observe closely youll see the wound closing before your eyes accelerated healing is just one of the handy things included in the vampire package
2962506 is she posable im sure anya said that dawn was
2962507 spike would you mind coming with me for a moment i think they might actually get something done without you there to distract them
2962508 what are you saying that my killer cheekbones and overwhelming sexual magnetism is making them incapable of concentrating well you might have a point also guess its not really fair to tempt them what with me being unavailable and all
2962509 look mate im dead and you cant die so dont get your knickers in a twist
2962510 so ive been told s probably because im not people
2962511 and im not returning either in you know a centurys time once our significant others have shuffled off this mortal coil that is presuming of course that im still alive then an havent been dusted or turned human
2962512 see its not me you want its him he obviously returned at some point recently trying to lure you back to your old life but you sent him packing and then i turn up same killer smile and sweet demeanour but all reformed and immortal to boot cept im not him even if you got me to love you the way you so clearly wish hed do itd never be the same and i dont fancy being a surrogate trust me
2962513 you know i i didnt really think that far how did you
2962514 well yours truly has spent his entire life being loves bitch and by now i know most of the ways in which love can screw you over i think
2962515 also if i dont get out of here iantos going to be whittling stakes soon
2962516 oh the boy hates me with the burning intensity of thousand fire y suns already even if hed never let on have seen his type before so bloody proper and controlled until you hit the wrong button and before you know where you are youve got a chernobyl on your hands
2962517 as i said i know the type homo sapiens fascinating species to study its funny though because he really has no cause to worry buffy aside basically i just dont really swing that way no offence
2962518 so you and angel never i mean sorry to be presumptuous but there are vibes old married couple vibes
2962519 anne rice got a few things right angels my grandsire that is he made drusilla who made me and back in the day when we were evil
2962520 wait did you say you might become human how does that work more of that magic or do you happen to have a chamelion arc that rewrites dna
2962521 its all about an apocalypse as usual but it has an epilogue of sorts where it says that the vampire with a soul will once he has fulfilled his destiny have his past washed clean and become human as a reward if he fights on the side of good i guess
2962522 so its either me or angel he says he signed it away but these things are hopelessly fickle and i trust the powers that be about as much as you trust this john of yours still it might just happen
2962523 i see but sorry if im prying but this is kinda weird what was that about having your past wiped clean sounds a little religious and you dont really strike me as the religious type
2962524 nothing religious about it very simple really because of the soul ill go to hell when i die one day same for angel unless we get this shanshu thats what its called the shanshu prophecy
2962525 eternal damnation hellfire all that crap heard of it right happens to be literal where were from
2962526 your john is a con man yeah killing people if theyre in his way that kinda thing
2962527 well i spent more than a century killing people for no other reason than it was fun ate a good portion of them mind you but mostly it was just a party got off on it men women children made no difference
2962528 so jack how am i going to kill you today i was thinking maybe a little light torture just to get the party started
2962529 slaughtered an orphanage once just for the hell of it brought the cutest ones home to dru to play with
2962530 anyway its getting late or early we should be off
2962531 if if im really never going to see you again
2962532 look spike its not about him i i guess i just have this thing for handsome heroes
2962533 its just spike but youve made me reconsider my opinion of captains
2962534 it was only a kiss didnt even have a dead preacher cluttering up the floor
2962535 even if you had both of them side by side it wouldnt be any less weird actually itd be even more confusing
2962536 one of buffys friends willow once had a double accidentally appearing from a different dimension only the other one was a vampire we should have killed her of course but in the end we just sent her back
2962537 why has no one ever told me about that a vampire willow
2962538 knew it almost turned her myself on two different occasions lucky i didnt of course although she did almost destroy the world that one time
2962539 oh yeah her girlfriend got killed and she went off the deep end powerful witch you see anyway the end of the world happens all the time back where were from or thats what it feels like anyway its only a problem really when you have to choose between saving the world and saving those you love
2962540 your grief is causing the air to grow stale and seeing your friends again would make it unbearable to be beside you do not forget that those you mourn died as heroes and no fate carries more honour
2962541 guess that ought to be goodmorning thank god its saturday

2962550 the cpp is a national party that will choose a running mate informed by the dictates of ethnicity tribe or religion no not at all the main criteria is somebody who can be president in his or her own right we have always been a national party we have broadly and widely appealed to ghanaians all over so we do not have religious or ethnic considerations in any of this
2962551 once the cpp comes up with a decision that person will be well liked that person will be somebody that we ourselves will feel comfortable with therefore that person will be very very competitive as far as the other people in the race are concerned
2962552 those are the things i am going to concentrate on
2962553 we only had a consideration for the pnc for an alliance the pnc after agreeing and indeed after dr mahama agreeing to be my running mate went back and decided that they want to reconsider it they have said that they would like to talk again i have not heard from them we have always believed that this is the time for the cpp to become stronger competitive and to win that is what we are concentrating on i believe that in time all who belong to the cpp will find their way back to the party

2962581 owing to depreciation of local currency against the us dollar rates of soybean which is imported in large quantity from india has sharply surged while the government has allowed export of maize which was locally produced is substantial quantity inside the country affecting its price to the detriment of poultry sector
2962582 we have petitioned the department of animal husbandry to ban the export of soybean meal so that the prices of poultry feed come down

2962631 the secretary general of nato repeated today his call for an immediate ceasefire

2962635 the reintegration of people on early release back into the community to stop people re offending and getting them back onto the straight and narrow is necessary and needed
2962636 properly located and adequately supervised bail accommodation is an effective way of dealing with people awaiting trial or reaching the end of their sentences
2962637 however there has been a shocking lack of consultation with local authorities and disregard for the wishes of local people some councillors are quite understandably furious that they have not been adequately consulted on what is happening in their area
2962638 its pure folly to dump this kind of accommodation into the middle of a residential street without properly asking for the councils views
2962639 the failure to consult genuinely with councils gives the unfortunate impression that they are established under a veil of secrecy this doesnt help the people on bail or on early release who come up against resentment from local people who have been unnecessarily alarmed
2962640 it is vital that councils are informed well in advance of an offenders release to ensure that the proper supervision and support is in place and to also assess any risk to local people and reassure the community that adequate safeguards are in place
2962641 the lga is seeking an assurance from the clearsprings that councils will not be overlooked and bypassed in this way in the future
2962642 local authorities need to be properly consulted and must have a real say about how much accommodation there is to be in their area and where it is to go

2962644 hollywood movies and tv shows such as terminator the sarah connor chronicles have been dismissed as fantastical over the years but this report based on existing research and current technoligcal developments suggests that robots will play a much bigger role in society over the next 75 years than previously anticipated
2962645 these robot developments could be extremely beneficial in the protechion of citizens and police in the hands of benevolent governments but in the wrong hands robot law enforcement could be a major blow to individual privacy and basic human rights
2962646 the robots themselves will not be super intelligent and will not be motivated to take over themselves but those who control the robots will control society

2962702 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2962703 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2962704 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2962705 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2962706 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

2962716 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2962717 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2962718 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2962719 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2962720 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2962721 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2962722 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2962723 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2962724 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2962725 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2962726 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2962727 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

2962737 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2962738 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2962739 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2962740 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2962741 who are open to doing something on the production side
2962742 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2962743 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2962744 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2962745 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2962746 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2962747 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2962748 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2962749 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2962750 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2962751 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2962752 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2962753 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2962754 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2962755 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2962756 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2962757 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2962758 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2962759 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2962760 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2962761 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2962762 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2962763 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2962764 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2962765 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2962766 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2962767 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2962768 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2962769 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2962770 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2962771 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2962772 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2962773 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2962774 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2962775 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2962776 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2962777 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2962778 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2962779 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2962780 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2962781 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2962782 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2962783 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2962784 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2962785 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2962786 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2962787 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2962788 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2962789 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2962790 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2962791 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2962792 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2962793 nie chodzi o oseti po udniow lecz o kontrolowanie szlak w energetycznych
2962794 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2962795 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2962796 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

2962806 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2962807 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2962808 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2962809 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

2962823 mit seiner operation in s dossetien hat russland drei dinge bewiesen 1 seine armee kann erfolgreiche operationen ausf hren woran ausl ndische beobachter gezweifelt haben 2 die russen k nnen die von den us milit rinstrukteuren getrimmten kr fte besiegen 3 russland hat bewiesen dass sich die usa und die nato nicht in der situation befinden die f r sie ein milit risches eingreifen in diesen konflikt erm glichen k nnte
2962824 au erdem galten diese signale polen und tschechien die das amerikanische raketenabwehrsystem bei sich aufstellen sollen russland bedroht nat rlich niemanden mit einer intervention es fordert aber alle auf die meinung ber das kr fteverh ltnis in der region zu revidieren
2962825 russland k nnte dies nur erreichen wenn es zu einem angriff bereit sein wird w hrend georgien berpr fen wird ob moskau blufft oder nicht folglich k nnen sich die russen keinen bluff leisten
2962826 moskau k nnte sich mehr w nschen und sogar kr fte einsetzen um das zu erreichen
2962827 je mehr diplomatische initiativen es aber geben wird die sich nicht auf st rke st tzen desto sicherer wird sich russland f hlen

2962832 this is one of the best quarters we have ever had
2962833 our earnings are strong utilization is high and our engine portfolio continues to grow as planned we have benefited greatly by being able to provide our customers with the engines that are in greatest demand several years ago we made the conscious decision to invest more heavily in new engines which power the latest generation of narrowbody aircraft namely the b737 ng and a320 model families that decision is serving us well today these engines have the latest technology are more fuel efficient environmentally friendly and cost less to maintain all attributes which make them more attractive to our customers especially now
2962834 the commercial aviation business is facing one of its biggest challenges ever in terms of having to find a way to deal with record high fuel costs many airlines have announced plans to reduce capacity by parking older less fuel efficient aircraft which are no longer economical to operate
2962835 cash is once again becoming a scarce commodity with our customers as they are required to support higher operating expenses driven by the cost of fuel when cash is tight airlines will turn to leasing for us it will mean more opportunities to purchase engines from our customers and lease them back as well as more opportunities to provide short term leases to customers wishing to defer large engine maintenance expenses
2962836 in keeping with the strategy of shifting the mix of engines within our portfolio to newer generation engine types we are in the process of selling and parting out seven jt8d engines which power the aging md 80 fleet leaving only ten of this engine type in our portfolio
2962837 consequently a 1 0 million write down of equipment was recorded in the second quarter to adjust book values for two of the seven engines with sale and projected part out proceeds expected to exceed the asset book values for the other five engines

2962839 perhaps the most amazing thing to me about the belief of many that george bush lied to the american public in starting his war with iraq is that the liberal columnists who have accused him of doing this merely make this point and then go on to the next paragraph in their columns
2962840 apparently its okay for george bush to take this nation to war on a lie to be responsible criminally responsible for well over 100 000 deaths but its not okay to prosecute him not only isnt it okay to prosecute him it isnt even okay to talk about prosecuting him this is unbelievable whats going on in this country how can we have a country where they permit a president to do what he did and they do absolutely nothing to him except to try to protect him

2962898 he was so enthusiastic and said he could manage by himself and ran out i heard the door slam
2962899 i asked some boys from scotch college who said he went to the park she said
2962900 we are trying every avenue of inquiry he may have slipped into the fast flowing creek and drowned he may be lost or he may be hiding from us we dont know what the story is said senior sergeant joe connor of boroondara police
2962901 he was a lost boy in india in a bombay mumbai orphanage and his survival skills would be more than that of other nine year old boys
2962902 inspiration to adopt yadav as a seven year old from mumbai and give him a better life
2962903 he was a lost child in india and had a difficult childhood that was not normal she said
2962904 sometimes he would explain to me that he got lost on a train from kalyan to mumbai and the police took him to the ashram orphanage for his safety
2962905 whenever he sees a train he looks at the train you cant explain what it feels like as a mother
2962906 we were a very happy family and already had the idea of coming here for our childrens education and had to go back to scratch and find a home and jobs ms munohur said

2962923 kalau aku lebih banyak dapat sex education di sekolah sebab di sekolah ada pelajarannya jadi di situ memperkenalkan kalau cowok seperti ini kalau cewek seperti ini lebih ke anatomi kalau di rumah aku tanya sama mama nanti mama yang ngejelasin
2962924 ah malu soal pertanyaan pada mamanya itu waktu aku kelas 3 atau kelas 4 aku tanya sama mama ma aku ada gimana caranya ya kan mama nikah emang nikah aja iya aku pas syuting lupa syuting apa aku denger itu dari kru trus aku tanya sama mama make love apa mama malah nanya balik kok kamu tau dari mana ya tau aja tapi jangan marah ya ma ya aku tau dari kru di lokasi syuting mama malah ngasih penjelasan ngasih tau apa sih sebenarnya itu setelah aku tahu ternyata oooo

2962942 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2962943 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2962944 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2962945 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2962946 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2962947 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2962948 the first time that i ever attended a meeting where he spoke was in new york city
2962949 your son should go out and take an mba program and go into the business world he has been very successful and thank you for that
2962950 but everybody knows thats the case with that company so everybody is paying prices that are too high and thats why i dont own the stock
2962951 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2962952 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2962961 world politics would be very different today were it not for winston churchill
2962962 victoria is a more interesting one she was not the most important figure of the victorian era but she was its greatest symbol
2962963 i think it is most astonishing that winston churchill has been omitted
2962964 i did lobby for wales i dont think you can talk about britishness without including wales
2962965 and as for the welsh being left out i would argue that david lloyd george was a fairly important part of british history
2962966 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2962967 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president
2962968 hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
2962969 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
2962970 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done
2962971 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
2962972 lee stressed his wish to enhance cooperation with australia in the fields of mineral resources and energy and asked for rudds support for korean enterprises operating in australia

2962982 developing measurement technologies to understand how people perform is an absolutely fundamental part of coaching
2962983 by putting all those sensors together you get a really accurate picture of how an individual is performing you can then relay that information in real time to a coach and they can see for example what the athlete is doing and how they can change their technique
2962984 its for when you are first learning and you are trying to visualise what you are going to see
2962985 it is to help the athlete learn orientation as they are doing the dive
2962986 the challenge for us was putting them up in swimming pools that werent designed to take them
2962987 we are looking at other ways other than evaporative heat loss to remove heat from the body
2962988 the aerodynamics particularly in the cycling events and triathlon events can make quite a significant difference to the amount of effort thats expended
2962989 but if the cost of that is that body temperature reaches the level at which heat exhaustion is likely then it is not a trade off you are going to accept
2962990 it is very adjustable to different people but it also much better mimics the track cycling event
2962991 they came into our apartment they ransacked our entire apartment went through all of our bags all of our luggage despite the fact that we never consented to any searches
2962992 we were taken to the police holding facility and interrogated for several hours before we were deported
2962993 any natural distribution of kinds of creatures on the earth includes five percent of those called pathfinders pioneers or elites
2962994 todays developed countries have succeeded by virtue of utilizing the pathfinders and elites among their intellectuals scientists researchers commentators authors and educated to handle problems and unanticipated events in their countries and to present real and effective solutions for them
2962995 the questions concerning those dealing with the affairs of the arab countries are where are the pathfinders of the arab peoples and where are their elites
2962996 there are several interconnected factors that answer these questions and the most important of them is that many of the arab pioneers men and women alike are persecuted in their countries have emigrated from them or are hidden away in the darkness of prisons
2962997 accordingly our problems that have continued for a very long time remain unsolved and are still brought up wearily in arab committees and national dialogues
2962998 the first reason for the backwardness ignorance and atrophy in the arab countries is that the important minds among the bright elites and the wise pathfinders are still struggling on all levels and in all classes
2962999 the deeds of nelson mandela who spent 28 years of his life in the prison of the oppressive south african regime are the greatest proof that the time for oppression and tyranny even if their violence increases and their evil expands is brief in the history of the nations and the peoples
2963000 many arab women wear in shame the garb of the old maid and stand humiliated
2963001 ladies dont wait for the trains it doesnt matter not where the man comes from or from which car of the train because hes hopeless from head to toe as long as arab blood runs in his veins
2963002 let us look together at the arab men beginning with their original land the arabian peninsula
2963003 with regard to the sons of the gulf countries and particularly the men from the oil countries they were raised to think that they are the best and that there is nothing in front of them or behind them
2963004 let us move now to the mother of the world egypt status gnaws at the hearts of its men and they sum each other up by material things all they are interested in are titles such as bey pasha and your honor
2963005 and now to the north african countries to the land of the brother commander al qaddhafi the men there have no tongues they swallowed their tongues decades ago and are chewing on the nonsense of the green book by al qaddhafi
2963006 let us look also at the country where the culture of death prevails algeria
2963007 what else is there to talk about ladies nothing can make you feel shame in spinsterhood or to regret the years you spend alone no it is a thousand times better to be an old maid than to marry a man in this miserable east
2963008 among the arabs the cycle of discrimination against the woman usually begins at home
2963009 the second stop in the cycle of discrimination against the woman is at school
2963010 the last stop in the cycle of discrimination is at work
2963011 in arab countries and particularly in the gulf countries the cycle of discrimination against the woman begins when she is a fetus in her mothers womb it continues when she emerges into the air of the world and goes on until her death
2963012 this abhorrent cycle of discrimination in which the arab woman lives began hundreds of years ago but it still exists wraps itself around her neck and restricts her movements as if she were a newborn baby it is a strangling cycle that wastes the abilities of half of society
2963013 second in some arab countries the womans guardian is her owner and the one who has the legal right to use her he controls all her affairs great and small his role is very similar to that of a jailor in guantanamo
2963014 third a prisoner in guantanamo like many arab women is not the master of his own body he has no power to control his own fate and his personal freedom has been taken away along with his right to protest his situation
2963015 fourth the prisoners in guantanamo are not protected by law and their lives are the property of their jailors just as the lives of the arab women are in the hands of their guardians when the guardian feels that his wife has crossed a red line she is doomed to a die terrible death
2963016 fifth many arab women have tried to escape or to kill themselves as a way out of their plight but they failed just as the guantanamo prisoners who tried to escape failed
2963017 sixth some arab women are forced to wear impractical and suffocating garments in colors that do not suit the scorching climate of our region
2963018 seventh a prisoner in guantanamo can see the sun feel its rays and enjoy the caress of fresh air on his face even when he is physically in chains whereas the women in some arab states are shackled both physically and spiritually
2963019 eighth all human rights organizations up to and including the u
2963020 i wish i knew why the situation of the women in certain arab states is not condemned by the countries of the world and does not enrage their citizens why do the human rights activists ignore their suffering as though they do not even exist why isnt the cry of these millions of women heard and why isnt it answered by anyone anywhere in the world why why why is it because they are women while our patriarchal world is ruled by men without an ounce of compassion in their hearts maybe that is indeed the case
2963021 the high hopes and the promises that they have given you saudi women are many but your situation is still as wretched and miserable as it has been for decades
2963022 some of you are postponing demanding your rights and explaining the postponement by the timing
2963023 arent we at war in every decade for whatever reason
2963024 the question to be asked is whether the vulnerable women in the arab countries will wait until the clouds of violence and cannon smoke dissipate to improve their situation
2963025 and you saudi women what are you waiting for you do not hesitate at all to help and support others and the proof of this is what you did for lebanon but you hesitate greatly to help yourselves i would like to understand why you hesitate to initiate the demand for your rights is it because there are no statistics that reveal the miserable situation of many saudi women knock on the doors of the courthouses and you will know the magnitude of this catastrophe is it because the blood of the saudi woman who is a victim of violence flows in complete silence so that no one pays attention or is it because the lives of the saudi women are dirt cheap and so they breathe their last without anyone noticing i do not know why you wait or how long you will wait
2963026 who know that their rights are stolen but havent the courage to demand them back
2963027 im afraid of the regimes reaction and of its oppressive laws im afraid of the violence of the fanatics and ignoramuses in my country im afraid my husband will divorce me and i will find myself defenseless im afraid my husband will punish me and take another wife
2963028 saudi women are weak no matter how high their status even the pampered ones among them because they have no law to protect them from attack by anyone the oppression of women and the effacement of their selfhood is a flaw affecting most homes in saudi arabia most saudi women whether educated or illiterate realize all too well that their lives are in the hands of the men if a saudi woman enjoys a life of pleasantness and well being it depends completely on the good nature and good intentions of the man with whom she lives
2963029 the reason most women who are depressed submissive and subject to various types of injustice accept their wretched situation is their increasing fear
2963030 in a world of technology rapid globalization and continuous international challenges improving the lot of saudi women and mobilizing them is no longer a matter of choice and luxury it is a necessity
2963031 we must open our eyes to the truth and that is that all the men the oil revolution military force and financial liquidity in saudi arabia cannot build a strong homeland when the role of the woman is ignored
2963032 all the arab regimes are u n members and have ratified the 1948 universal declaration of human rights which clearly decrees justice equal rights and equal obligations for all citizens nevertheless in our chauvinistic country the woman is still considered the property of her family
2963033 legislation in the arab countries overtly discriminates against women overtly oppresses their rights and harms them as human beings
2963034 improving the womans situation will not be via solutions that are outdated and proven to be ineffective
2963035 the unresolved problems of women are not religious but purely legal women must be treated in accordance with the international conventions guaranteeing human rights freedoms and dignity legislation that takes away the rights of the woman as a citizen must be replaced by legislation guaranteeing her full rights as a human being the time has come to annul the chauvinistic interpretations that incite to violence and incite to discrimination against and persecution of women and to the removal of their rights

2963116 like everybody i want to get the gold medal and will do anything to get it
2963117 there are a lot of expectations because im a world champion and there is a lot of pressure
2963118 if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
2963119 you definitely had to bring your a game to win a medal and those three guys that beat me did
2963120 were seeing world records get broken like its the easiest thing in the world and its not everyones swimming fast everyones got a smile on his face and its been fun so far

2963128 bindras remarkable achievement will inspire other indian athletes to perform excellently in the remaining parts of the olympics
2963129 on the podium the chinese man was crying while today india is laughing

2963131 cricket rules the roost in india but now the youngsters have a role model who plays some other sport it augurs well for us

2963133 im more proud than ever to be an american right now and to play on this team i think its the best feeling in the world to play in these olympics
2963134 were completely confident that when were all on the same page like we were sunday were ready to play whoever
2963135 that goes pretty quickly weve got to refocus everything dont dwell on that but rather the good parts that changed the game being on the same wavelength i dont think there will be many of us holding our heads heading into nigeria
2963136 others play in there too its all up in the air coach peter nowak will evaluate it and give us the best options
2963137 well have time to think about that in the next couple of days
2963138 freddy and michael will not play but as ive said from the beginning its all about the group the 18 players weve chosen have to be up to the challenge

2963149 the talks are work in progress we are continuing tomorrow morning
2963150 lei parla degli americani chiaro che sono in certo modo parte del conflitto e per questo la presenza e la forza dellunione europea devono essere sottolineate
2963151 non credo che gli americani si impegneranno pi avanti certo bisogner farli partecipare al processo di pace
2963152 il processo di pace deve essere iniziato e di fatto cos sta avvenendo dal presidente sarkozy che ha la presidenza dellunione europea
2963153 le violenze in georgia sono inaccettabili la risposta di mosca sproporzionata
2963154 non possiamo restare inermi davanti allaggressione russa la sua continuazione avr serie conseguenze nelle relazioni con gli stati uniti
2963155 ho detto che questa violenza inaccettabile non lho detto soltanto a vladimir putin il primo ministro russo ndr lho detto anche al presidente del paese dmitry medvedev
2963156 ho espresso la mia preoccupazione a proposito della risposta sproporzionata della russia
2963157 laggressione russa non deve rimanere senza risposta la sua prosecuzione avrebbe serie conseguenze per i rapporti con gli stati uniti
2963158 ich sch tze friedrich merz als sehr klugen kopf es gibt zu wenige in der union die den weg in die b rokratische staatswirtschaft nicht mitmachen wollen

2963185 not yet we are not through yet there are always sticky points of course in any such dialogue but we are overcoming
2963186 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more it is a tough area but convenient for the university as chinese students we do not have any affairs with other people i want to know why this happened sometimes local children attack us i dont know whether it is because we come from another country

2963197 es contradictorio que un gobierno que ha manejado los m s altos niveles de ingresos en la historia del pa s no haya podido cumplir con el pueblo
2963198 sin dinero con limitaciones pero respondiendo al sentimiento del pueblo de barquisimeto que busca cambios sin retaliaciones
2963199 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced
2963200 public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily it is time to tighten the bail laws and put public safety first
2963201 the presumption of bail is one that is consistent with the presumption of innocence until someone has gone through the trial process you have to assume that someone is innocent there is no reason for an assuming just because of what someone is charged with that you remove any right to bail
2963202 if there is a real fear of either of these happening they will not be granted bail
2963203 everybody whos a democrat and a serious politician will want to be remembered as voting on the right side of history
2963204 we shot the episode from 1 a m to 4 a m i had a tough time keeping my eyes open but salman entertained us all through he played a double role he was both the host and the hero of one of the films i was promoting

2963218 it is interesting that in korea they are now looking for ways of classifying dogs as livestock this means that their meat will be used just like beef
2963219 the chinese say dog meat can increase a mans virility that is why it is not a common dish in china it is only eaten on special occasion

2963241 the industry marketing has much to answer for when it comes to the issue of ethical behaviour
2963242 ads sell more than products they sell images values goals concepts of who we are and who we should be they shape our attitudes and our attitudes shape our behaviour

2963250 our customers saw the lowest bill increases of all water and wastewater companies when prices were set back in 2005
2963251 we have improved our efficiency and rank among the top water and wastewater companies in england and wales
2963252 we are determined to keep price increases as low as we can between 2010 and 2015 by prioritising our investment and being efficient
2963253 we believe that this proposal represents good value for money for our customers
2963254 this relatively modest increase in customers bills will allow us to deliver a significant investment programme to maintain high levels of service and improve the security of supply in spite of rising costs and the long term challenges we face
2963255 we recognise that anglian water is facing steeply rising energy costs and needs to carry out a lot of work by 2015 to ensure a safe reliable service for a growing number of consumers
2963256 we are encouraged that the company is proposing to cover these costs in part through shareholder money rather than passing the full burden on to customers
2963257 the average increase in annual bills of 13 before inflation although modest will stretch some people when added to other household price increases
2963258 the consumer council for water together with other industry bodies asked consumers what they want from their water companies between 2010 and 2015 it will take time to analyse and understand the draft plan in full and compare it against what consumers in the area have told us that they want but early signs are that it is good news for anglian water consumers

2963270 australian consumers have been paying much more for their credit than uk and us consumers this will hopefully become a thing of the past if the current credit report proposals set out by the alrc are acted upon quickly
2963271 this is proven to be the most valuable data for spotting consumers falling into financial difficulty and without it lenders cannot lend as responsibly as they could
2963272 it is a ludicrous claim by some commentators that giving lenders access to more comprehensive data will lead to reckless lending
2963273 to drive down the cost of credit legislators need to allow lenders to share credit payment performance data with the credit reference agencies
2963274 at the moment australian lenders and consumers are flying blind comparatively speaking

2963281 russia is trading really cheaply and this is yet another blow to investors confidence
2963282 three weeks ago the russian market was one of the top three in the world while the rest had sunk 17 50 russian stocks had fallen only 5 0
2963283 the turning in the oil trade problems in the u s financial sector trouble at the coal and steel firm mechel and the initiation of a war in southern russia are all contributing factors to this downturn
2963284 inflation has been an outstanding issue for the russian central bank by buying rubles they are trying to boost the currency having a stronger ruble helps fight inflation as it becomes cheaper for people to buy exports
2963285 we have introduced tough laws including increasing the minimum age at which someone can be sold a knife from 16 to 18 and penalties for shopkeepers who do beak the law
2963286 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve
2963287 for some time police forces have been working closely with trading standards to address the illegal sale of knives to young people
2963288 while there were those involved in the protest who were sensible and responsible there were also those clearly intent on breaking into the power station to shut it down
2963289 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
2963290 the decision to deploy specialist units including dogs and horses is always considered carefully because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest
2963291 there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop

2963487 natural selection codes for survival not comfort this gene although uncomfortable could be beneficial to survival

2963492 she moreno was tested in the village and she had already left china that evening before having had the result
2963493 the test has come back positive for epo the disciplinary commission has ruled that she should be excluded from the games and have her accreditation withdrawn
2963494 its very surprising it appears that the spanish anti doping controls didnt detect anything in their tests back in spain before the athlete traveled out
2963495 we dont know how many tests she underwent but obviously she didnt pass the last one were examining the case

2963497 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety

2963505 all dies ist zu einem politischen skandal geworden seit das parlament involviert ist

2963525 irgendwann werden die leute fragen was ist da an substanz au er polemik kann ich nicht viel erkennen
2963526 angesichts der entschlossenheit russlands einen fu im s dkaukasus behalten zu wollen muss man zun chst entschieden die souver nit t georgiens verteidigen es w re unsinnig russland erniedrigen zu wollen doch moskau sollte die schleichende besetzung s dossetiens und abchasiens durch unterst tzung der separatisten einstellen georgien will in die nato was russland als bedrohung betrachtet ber diese dinge muss man reden in erster linie mit den usa russland und der europ ischen union die europ ische diplomatie sollte als fortf hrung der deutschen initiative zu abchasien in moskau vermitteln um den frieden auf unserem kontinent zu bewahren
2963527 die eskalation des konflikts zwischen russland und georgien um s dossetien sowie die ausweitung des kriegsgeschehens haben die haltung der usa und anderer westlicher staaten grundlegend ge ndert
2963528 die entscheidung des georgischen pr sidenten micheil saakaschwili zur milit rischen intervention in s dossetien war ein tragischer fehler der staatschef durfte trotz aller provokationen der separatisten das recht nicht in die eigene hand nehmen das gewaltsame vorgehen gegen ossetien ist nicht zu rechtfertigen die entscheidung bedeutete obendrein aber auch einen politischen fehler und daraus versucht russlands ministerpr sident wladimir putin nun kapital zu schlagen seine berzogene reaktion macht deutlich dass er die absicht hat russlands hegemonie in der region zu st rken
2963529 wie das neue russland krieg f hrt l sst sich wieder am konflikt im kaukasus ablesen von verh ltnism igkeit im sinne der vielen theoretiker und v lkerrechtler kann keine rede sein der brutale einsatz von kampfbombern und raketen gegen georgisches territorium und wohnh user von zivilisten als antwort auf wahrscheinlich provozierte bergriffe gegen russische sogenannte friedenssoldaten zeigt dies berdeutlich
2963530 w re georgien schon nato mitglied wie es vor allem die usa wollten dann h tte die allianz jetzt einen verteidigungsfall amerikaner deutsche kanadier spanier sie alle m ssten den georgiern zu hilfe eilen und die anlaufende invasion der kaukasusrepublik zu beenden versuchen man kann es aber auch weiterdenken w re georgien mitglied der nato kommenden dezember wollten die nato minister ber den beitrittsplan beraten w re es gar nicht erst zu dem krieg gekommen russland h tte nicht gewagt georgien anzugreifen und micheil saakaschwili h tte es sich zweimal berlegt mit freundlicher nachhilfe des westens ob er die anderen nato staaten in einen konflikt um eine winzige separatistenprovinz ziehen darf
2963531 die russischen absichten zeigen sich auch in den bombardierungen von zielen in georgien selbst ziele sind st dte aber auch l einrichtungen fabriken und milit rbasen ganz offensichtlich kommt russland nicht um seine br der zu retten sondern ergreift die gelegenheit um der infrastruktur des wirtschaftlich ziemlich erfolgreichen georgiens einen schweren schlag zu versetzen der westen kann auf kurze sicht wenig ausrichten au er vielleicht saakaschwili hinter verschlossenen t ren daf r zu r ffeln dass er den russen diesen vorwand gab aber der verlauf der k mpfe zeigt nur wie recht die balten polen georgier ukrainer und andere direkte nachbarn russlands haben dass nur die feste integration im westen einschlie lich der nato mitgliedschaft schutz gegen russische einmengung bietet
2963532 die territoriale integrit t von georgien muss respektiert werden und dass sich abchasien und s dossetien als aufst ndische provinzen betragen gibt russland nicht das recht sein milit r dorthin zu schicken dennoch kann man sich fragen was den prowestlichen und vor allem proamerikanischen pr sidenten micheil saakaschwili bewegt hat diesen lokalen brandherd anzufachen man kann sich des gedankens nicht erwehren dass saakaschwili ein eingreifen des westens herausfordern wollte er hat es noch nicht verwunden dass eine mehrheit beim nato gipfel im april seinem land die mitgliedschaft in dem milit rb ndnis verweigerte
2963533 der wehrlose saakaschwili hat den westen um hilfe gebeten keine gro macht hat diesen appell beantwortet mehr noch wahrscheinlich atmen die westlichen staaten auf erleichtert dar ber dass georgien beim nato gipfel in bukarest kein gr nes licht f r einen nato beitritt bekommen hat denn sonst w ren frankreich deutschland und sogar rum nien verpflichtet das georgische territorium im fall eines russischen angriffs zu verteidigen der georgische pr sident hat auch an dieser front verloren und das nato treffen im dezember bei dem der kaukasische staat zur vorbereitung eines beitritts in den membership action plan h tte aufgenommen werden sollen wird verschoben oder annulliert werden denn auch europa kann sich keinen krieg gegen russland leisten
2963534 illegal logging reduces the protective function of forests which frequently increases the risk of natural disasters such as floods and landslides and leads to deforestation one of the main causes for climate change illegal logging also pushes down wood prices leading to major economic losses for the producer states industries and local communities
2963535 as the uk clearly plays a major role in fuelling this illegal trade the government needs to ensure the eu urgently introduces legislation to prevent illegal timber entering the eu and thereby help protect the worlds last remaining forests
2963536 it is heartbreaking it is very very hard to do but i am trying to be strong about it and do what is best for me
2963537 i am so grateful for michala i am just so happy to be handing the role to her
2963538 that biofuels can have an important role in reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change
2963539 we need to proceed cautiously until we can be certain that their expanded growth and use maximises the benefits and minimises the risks to our world
2963540 to tackle climate change we will need to develop new cleaner fuels but that doesnt mean pushing forward indiscriminately on biofuels that may do more harm than good
2963541 the rainforest is under threat right now the orang utans habitat is being wiped out right now by palm oil plantations
2963542 it has done nothing to close the loopholes which support unsustainable and inefficient us corn based ethanol
2963543 in the uk we have a great opportunity of doing this really well because we produce these crops sustainably
2963544 its a courageous and decisive step in breaking the species barrier and granting deserved rights to those beings closest to us
2963545 this is either a ridiculous society or a dislocated one
2963546 asking for human rights for monkeys is like asking for bull rights for men
2963547 they are animals with highly developed intelligence and emotional capacity
2963548 they have curiosity they feel affection and jealousy they lie and they suffer horribly when they are deprived of their freedom
2963549 ive always said that as activists we have to separate our campaign against bullfighting from that of other animal rights because if we dont bullfighting will stop the whole thing theyre too powerful
2963550 it gives us a sense of who we are as a people
2963551 i think quite often some researchers just look at gibbons like monkeys
2963552 in the initial studies they just tested one or two gibbons and said oh yeah they failed
2963553 it is clear that the sumatran orangutan is in rapid decline and unless extraordinary efforts are made soon it could become the first great ape species to go extinct
2963554 although these revised estimates for borneo are encouraging forest loss and associated loss of orangutans are occurring at an alarming rate and suggest that recent reductions of bornean orangutan populations have been far more severe than previously supposed
2963555 it is essential that conservation measures are taken to protect orangutans outside national parks and these measures will by necessity be specific to each region
2963556 both are examples of ill advised projects with few benefits to local economies but major environmental costs
2963557 however as such projects provide substantial revenue for a small group of individuals with considerable political influence unprecedented political will is needed to prevent similar projects in the future
2963558 all efforts to monitor orangutans however will be to no avail unless the decline in numbers is halted and this requires a change in political will
2963559 it is essential that funding for environmental services reaches the local level and that there is strong law enforcement developing a mechanism to ensure these occur is the challenge for the conservation of orangutans
2963560 first we have an unambiguous scientifically rigorous answer when regulators and policymakers ask us how many orangutans really remain and how that compares to historical population sizes
2963561 those responsible for environmental stewardship cannot hide indecisively behind purported scientific uncertainty
2963562 second those answers are the results of pooled knowledge of nearly two dozen high profile investigators who set aside their own professional reputations and agendas to collect data in a standardized format and share the results for a very high common priority the literal survival of the species that they study and love
2963563 in addition to being a critical contribution to orangutan conservation this paper is an exemplar of collaboration among conservation scientists and practitioners
2963564 this represents enormous amounts of work from the authors and demonstrates their commitments to the science of orangutan conservation
2963565 its a particularly notable achievement for dr wich and continues his extraordinary dedication to the study of orangutans
2963566 it is my fervent hope that these data inspire action on the part of everyone who can positively affect orangutan conservation

2963576 if former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic should be put on trial the opinion here is so too should saakashvili
2963577 once the bombing stops i believe saakashvili will not survive
2963578 what russia has been doing against georgia for the last two days represents an open aggression unprecedented in modern times
2963579 it is a direct challenge for the whole world if russia is not stopped today by the whole world tomorrow russian tanks might reach any european capital i think everyone has understood this by now
2963580 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2963581 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6
2963582 saakashvili has been trying to internationalize the conflicts in georgia since he has come to office
2963583 it has been very much his strategy to make this an international conflict between the traditional west and russia speaking in language of the cold war and saying that this is really the last frontier hes been racking up those kind of expressions in the past few days but this is really nothing new
2963584 why precisely now what made saakashvili decide that this was the right moment politically in my opinion one of the reasons is that mikheil saakashvili believes the current us administration has certain obligations toward him and the next presidential administration particularly if this is a democratic administration wont feel it has any of these obligations and may modify the overall stance on georgia
2963585 i really think he saakashvili has taken it a step too far because if we were really going to push back the russians you would need something like a military intervention and that is not going to happen
2963586 russia has been trying increase its international legitimacy as a defender of international law not only in the caucasus but also weve been seeing this in the balkans as well with the positions russia has been taking on kosovo it is going to be more difficult for them to stand in front of the security council as the big defender of international law while theyre bombing civilian targets and georgian cities

2963591 the single strategy of severing natos supply lines from pakistan is the key to success if the blockage is successfully implemented in 2008 the western coalition will be forced to leave afghanistan in 2009 and if implemented next year the exit is certain by 2010
2963592 without such information an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2963593 irans decision to disperse and keep secret several of its key sites further hinders the development of a full picture of its centrifuge complex
2963594 considering the modular replicable nature of centrifuge plants we conclude that an attack on irans nuclear program is unlikely to significantly degrade irans ability to reconstitute its gas centrifuge program
2963595 an emphasis on military responses to this conflict has the effect of discouraging iran from allowing more effective iaea inspections something necessary for the successful conclusion of a diplomatic solution to irans nuclear program
2963596 iran is understandably concerned that more transparency on its part could lead to the us and israeli militaries gaining better targeting information on its nuclear program
2963597 it is time to set aside the military option and concentrate instead on credible diplomatic approaches to end irans growing nuclear weapons capabilities
2963598 could prompt iran to hasten its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons by embarking on a crash programme
2963599 iran could then build a small centrifuge plant at a secret location capable of producing weapons grade uranium for one or two nuclear weapons per year
2963600 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
2963601 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travelers
2963602 we now have a similar situation at new york airports with government imposed restrictions the heathrow new york jfk route is by far the most important transatlantic market accounting for over 25 of the total heathrow us market

2963606 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2963607 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2963608 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2963609 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2963610 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2963623 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2963624 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2963625 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2963678 our capacity has been reduced 3 1 per cent versus last year i think that willie walsh has been quite upfront about that he has said it is inevitable that fares will rise
2963679 the data speaks for itself it took a good three years for the industry to recover from the downturn in 2001 when it had a five per cent drop in capacity and a sevenper cent drop in flights
2963680 from our statistics it looks quite possible that we may be facing a far more severe global downturn than we have experienced before
2963681 the industrys resilience will be pushed to its limits in the coming months

2963685 i want to speak to you today regarding the miserable condition to which pakistan has deteriorated
2963686 let there be no doubt in your minds that dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2963687 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2963688 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2963689 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
2963690 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all

2963692 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
2963693 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality

2963706 auch die zivilcourage ist in diesen f llen wichtig und richtig wir m ssen in diesem tragischen bereich unsere gesellschaft noch mehr sensibilisieren
2963707 ich fordere berger und fekter auf dieses gesetz nicht unn tig aufzuweichen und zu verz gern es geht hier um effizienten schutz f r unsere kinder und nicht um parteiengepl nkel
2963708 die sp muss auf der stelle den entstandenen schaden gut machen und die gesamten kosten f r die schamlose eigen pr von sp obmann werner faymann zur ckzahlen

2963712 eine staatlich verordnete preisregulierung ist f r jedes am kapitalmarkt t tige unternehmen extrem sch dlich au erdem ist jede staatliche reglementierung im endeffekt kontraproduktiv man muss doch auch sehen dass der verbund erfolgreich ist sch ne gewinne einf hrt eine hohe dividende und auch extrem viel steuern zahlt welche in den staatshaushalt flie en wie eine regierung diese gelder dann verteilt um beispielsweise die auswirkungen der energieverteuerung zu bek mpfen ist aufgabe der politiker
2963713 als jugendministerin kann ich das wissen die energie und die kreativit t der jugendlichen vielfach und beeindruckend erleben junge menschen sind die besten sensoren f r ein gesundes miteinander f r soziales handeln und f r eine nachhaltige und verantwortungsvolle politik
2963714 jugendliche erwarten sich aber zurecht von der politik dass diese sich gemeinsam mit ihnen f r deren anliegen einsetzt und f r ihre zukunft arbeitet
2963715 und genau das versuche ich umzusetzen ich will nicht nur politik f r junge machen sondern vor allem politik mit jungen menschen gestalten
2963716 w hlen ab 16 ist ein deutliches signal an die jugendlichen dass ihre anliegen ernst genommen werden und ihre meinung gefragt ist und ich hoffe dass sie zahlreich von dieser m glichkeit gebrauch machen werden
2963717 als jugendministerin ist es meine pflicht einmischungspolitik zu betreiben und darauf hinzuweisen dass jugendpolitik mehr ist als die f rderung von freizeitprojekten
2963718 offensichtlich m ssen auch viele erwachsenen erst lernen die positiven seiten unserer kinder und jugendlichen wieder wahr zu nehmen
2963719 es ist mir daher auch ein anliegen und der un tag der jugend ein willkommener anlass dass dieses gro e potenzial der jugend sichtbar gemacht wird anerkennung findet und f r die zukunft noch verst rkt genutzt wird an diesem internationalen tag der jugend m chte ich alle politisch verantwortlichen dazu aufrufen die tatkraft die ideen und das engagement der jugend nicht nur zu erkennen sondern es auch zu nutzen und zu f rdern

2963731 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
2963732 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
2963733 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

2963791 are you out of your mind this is still a male dominated world its women who need saving screw the men
2963792 while women have been cast as victims martyrs mystics or saints men have quietly retreated into their caves the better to muffle emotions that fluctuate between hilarity are these bitches crazy or what and rage yes they are and theyve got our kids
2963793 in the process of fashioning a more female friendly world we have created a culture that is hostile towards males contemptuous of masculinity and cynical about the delightful differences that make men irresistible especially when something goes bump in the night
2963794 in popular culture rare is the man portrayed as wise strong and noble in film and music men are variously portrayed as dolts bullies brutes deadbeats rapists sexual predators and wife beaters even otherwise easy going family men in sitcoms are invariably cast as at best bumbling dim witted fools one would assume from most depictions that the smart decent man who cares about his family and pats the neighbours dog is the exception rather than the rule
2963795 every once in a while a book not so much lands on your desk as lobs itself like a hand grenade exploding preconceived wisdoms and shattering the bones of the status quo
2963796 american author kathleen parkers courageous thesis is that initially through extreme feminism then via its craven implementation into society women have demonised men and trivialised their contribution especially to family life
2963797 i say courageous because in the eyes of many women and of the liberal establishment suggesting men have had a rough deal is nothing short of heresy parker should be burnt at the stake they cry but isnt it ironic that only a woman could make such a plea for men
2963798 she argues as long as men feel marginalised by the women whose favour and approval they seek as long as they are alienated from their children and treated as criminals by family courts as long as they are disrespected by a culture that no longer values masculinity tied to honour as long as boys are bereft of strong fathers and our young men and women wage sexual war then we risk cultural suicide
2963799 its enough to set a feminists hair on end parker argues that in trying to make the world fairer for women an adjustment most agree was vital we have made it unfair for men in our attempt to honour women we have dishonoured men
2963800 by bending over backwards to make single mothers feel good about themselves by diminishing the role of fathers by elevating women as the superior parents we have gone a considerable way to destroying one of the basic tenets of a successful society family life
2963801 apart from the effects of this seismic social shift on society it is also grossly unfair
2963802 the traditional male values what parker almost poetically calls masculinity tied to honour are now seen as nothing more than a direct assault on women
2963803 an acceptable male model now is more likely to be of the david beckham variety wearing more make up than the missus hairless perfumed varnished emasculated by his bossy wife and perhaps fond of wearing her undies
2963804 good dads loving husbands supportive male role models theyre few and far between even in the fictional world of tv but in the real world it wasnt enough that we demanded they be more like us we superior human beings we had to traduce men as well treating them in almost all forms of popular culture as useless ineffectual even comic characters or as violent cheating and untrustworthy
2963805 the feminist movement has a new hate figure someone who has inspired more loathing among its members than hugh hefner peter stringfellow and all the other male chauvinist pigs you can think of and shock horror shes a woman
2963806 american author kathleen parker has written a book entitled save the males that challenges the foundations of 21st century feminism
2963807 her passionate defence of the male sex and their worth in the world at large has had many women across the pond foaming at the mouth they regard parker as a traitor to her gender she dares to suggest that in trying to make the world fairer for women they have made it grossly unfair to men
2963808 she argues that by going out of our way to make single mothers feel good about themselves by diminishing the role of fathers by elevating women as the superior parents we have gone a long way towards destroying one of the major building blocks of society the nuclear family
2963809 so desperate dan was out and david beckham was in men shouldnt be afraid to dye their hair wear perfume and use a little moisturiser to keep their complexion looking lovely
2963810 parker also writes about the assault on the traditional male character in films and television
2963811 look at the types of men portrayed in any british soap or sitcom theyre either bumbling feckless eejits like coronation streets steve the pencil chewing taxi driver or serial womanisers like the ginger minger in eastenders
2963812 the state reinforces this low opinion of fathers on both sides of the atlantic
2963813 the family courts effectively make fathers a slave to the state his wages become state property his time with his children is determined by a family court judge and he faces jail if for whatever reason he fails to pay his child support on time
2963814 after going through the simulation many doctors said wow i had no idea it was this intense this early on
2963815 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2963816 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2963817 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

2963842 mediasentry now called safenet the riaas illegal unlicensed investigator of choice
2963843 arent they supposed to be held in the spirit of freedom and openness not in china
2963844 what difference does it make im sure a lot of people still refer to them as mediasentry either because they prefer to or because they still think its called that internally and publicly most likely because that is what it is still called

2963863 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2963864 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2963865 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2963866 while there were those involved in the protest who were sensible and responsible there were also those clearly intent on breaking into the power station to shut it down
2963867 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
2963868 the decision to deploy specialist units including dogs and horses is always considered carefully because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest
2963869 there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop
2963870 our legal team are going to be exhausting every possible channel for holding the police accountable for the draconian use of stop and search measures for the things they confiscated and for their violent incursions on to the camp
2963871 every year police use the supposed existence of a hardcore minority as justification for their heavy handedness and every year this hardcore minority fails to materialise
2963872 they are very happily getting on with the business of returning the field to the state in which they found it
2963873 if we find evidence that anyone has acted inappropriately or failed to demonstrate the standards we set and expect kent police and partner police forces will address this
2963874 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2963875 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2963876 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2963877 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2963878 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2963879 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2963880 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2963881 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2963882 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2963883 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2963884 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2963885 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2963886 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2963887 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2963888 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2963889 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2963890 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2963891 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2963892 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2963893 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2963894 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2963895 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2963896 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2963897 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2963898 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2963899 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2963900 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2963903 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2963904 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2963905 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2963906 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2963907 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2963908 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2963909 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2963910 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2963911 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2963912 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2963913 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2963914 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2963915 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2963916 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2963917 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2963918 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2963919 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2963920 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2963921 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2963922 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2963923 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2963924 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2963925 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2963926 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2963927 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2963928 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2963929 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2963930 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2963931 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

2963934 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2963935 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2963936 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2963937 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2963938 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2963939 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

2963958 i wasnt sure i had really seen what i thought i had
2963959 it was strange i hadnt encountered anything like it before i wanted to make sure so i asked the cashier what the discount was and why he was not giving it to me
2963960 he insisted that it wasnt a discount but i said cancel the purchase and scan it again so he relented and said its a discount only for minorities
2963961 i asked him what it meant and he said a discount only for arabs i said what do you mean if i was arab you would give me a discount he said yes definitively it was really strange i decided not to argue and to forgo the discount so i paid full price for the products i had purchased
2963962 i didnt expect to get a discount but i was appalled when i realized that had i been arab i would have received one i tried to think what would happen if it was a discount only for jews or sephardim or ashkenazim

2963969 perkembangan islam di as menunjukkan peningkatan menarik kebelakangan ini apabila lebih ramai memeluk islam khususnya selepas tragedi 11 september
2963970 walaupun ada pihak di barat termasuk media mengaitkan islam dengan keganasan ia seperti tidak berkesan dalam menggugat minat mereka terhadap islam
2963971 rakyat as terutama generasi muda muslim juga semakin berani menonjolkan identiti islam dan lebih terbuka dalam pergaulan dengan penduduk lain berbanding genarasi terdahulu

2963973 de havde tilbagegang i oms tningen i f rste kvartal p 8 pct hvilket overraskede os lidt enten er det et udtryk for at de taber markedsandele i jeblikket og ikke kan f lge med markedsv ksten eller ogs er det et udtryk for noget periodeforskydning som de har v ret ude at advare om
2963974 i andet kvartal skal man holde ekstraordin rt je med oms tningen om den viser samme tendens som i f rste kvartal eller om der er en fremgang at spore vi tror p det kommer ud med noget der ligner en oms tningsfremgang p 15 pct i andet kvartal det burde ogs bane vejen for at deres marginer kan blive yderligere styrket
2963975 det ger virkelig forventningerne til at hvis det ger oms tningen i andet kvartal som vi tror det g r s burde marginen presse op i underkanten af 10 pct for andet kvartal isoleret
2963976 tallene fra awea viser at vestas markedsandel har v ret under kraftigt pres i usa og det ger selvf lgelig ikke forventningerne til at de kan m nstre en flot fremgang p toplinjen
2963977 og s skal det alts hente det i tredje og fjerde kvartal hvor der s bliver lidt mere pres p selskabets guidance l gger jo op til at det skal vokse hurtigere p hele ret end det har gjort i f rste kvartal og m ske ogs i andet kvartal det viser noget om at der implicit skal v re en v kst i tredje og fjerde kvartal p noget der ligner 30 35 pct hvis det skal n det og det tror jeg stadigv k det kan

2964007 since my daughter michelle will also participate as a torch bearer we think one torch bearer in the family will suffice
2964008 we decided to do low and high fives and clasp hands in the air

2964015 clearly our aim is to make sure seats are filled
2964016 clearly our aim is to make sure seats are filled with schoolchildren if not by people who have paid the full price but there are rules that the international olympic committee set about ticket pricing

2964018 the birds nest stadium is probably the last iconic olympics stadium why because its capacity is a bit over 85 000 in the uk we have an 85 000 seater stadium more than and its our national stadium wembley
2964019 we dont need another 85 000 seater stadium you cant on the one hand bemoan the fact that we are not going to have an iconic stadium like the birds nest and at the same time go on about white elephants being left behind after the olympics are over
2964020 our focus is making sure that every single olympic building has a very clear legacy purpose and if there isnt legacy need then we will build temporary venues and take them down at the end

2964052 from this point forward she began to constantly walk the dogs in our yard
2964053 i would tell her to get the dogs out of the yard always hearing the same responses it is not your yard stating we are harassing her yelling obscenities giving visual obscenities etc

2964074 many will say unto me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
2964075 these things have i written unto you that ye may know that ye have eternal life
2964076 except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
2964077 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new
2964078 we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself

2964083 we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death
2964084 if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him
2964085 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his

2964102 we have a responsibility to the environment and the children who use our playgrounds to do everything in our power to use the most environmentally friendly substances
2964103 we are proud to be the first major playground manufacturer to do something about the actual problem of pvc and not just offset its effects by other means
2964104 moving away from pvc is the best choice for environmentally conscientious play facilities
2964105 while we will incur a short term capital cost we will be providing a more environmentally stable line of products with additional performance benefits
2964106 being a green company is something we take very seriously
2964107 playworld expects to be pvc free by october 1 2008 when its new line of playgrounds becomes available nationally

2964111 so far this year more than 1 25 million americans faced the risk of loosing their homes to foreclosure up 7 3 from june 2008 and up 88 62 from july 2007
2964112 the nations southwest and southeast regions have been hardest hit with three and four times the number of pre foreclosures in july 2008 than in the northeast and midwest southwest 86 625 southeast 65 458 northeast 20 541 midwest 19 640
2964113 looking at pre foreclosure filings as a percent of households the best way to judge future foreclosure trends this year 7 2 out of every 1 000 house holds nationwide faced possible foreclosure
2964114 again numbers in the nations southwest and southeast were up big at least almost double those in the northeast and midwest as overextended homeowners in nevada arizona florida and california led the nation pre foreclosure problems
2964115 short term theres no question that the foreclosure outlook is grim
2964116 foreclosures and short sales selling homes for less than their loan value make up a huge chunk of todays sales market and those low sales prices are skewing sales values down
2964117 but thanks to the new housing bill recently passed first time home buyers are coming into the market to grab their 7 500 tax credits fha reform is easing their loan process and there is a ton of affordable housing to chose from plus for the first time in a long time you can buy a near new home for less than its replacement cost

2964133 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2964134 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so

2964152 we have enjoyed being a partner with virgin megastores since their program launched in october 2006 the virgin megastores marketing team has really been focused on making the in store experience fun and relevant to their customer base since the program went live
2964153 virgin megastores has shown immense loyalty to their own customers and in my opinion thats been the key to their success not just within their v i p program but across their entire business
2964154 we saw we could integrate what we were already doing such as live in store events and competitions with the visible results program the card has taken our activities to a new level its not just a card its an experience
2964155 programs like v i p allow retailers to build an insightful database that measures the real impact of all of their marketing activities leading retailers such as virgin megastores are using the information generated by their loyalty programs to make sure the money spent on customers is both targeted and effective i am pleased that visible results has been able to play a role in their current success and i look forward to what lies ahead for v i p members
2964156 the import volumes of fine paper and packaging paper from europe have recently grown and the company is working to preserve its market share and quantitative sales while dealing with a certain erosion of selling prices the sharp change in the currency exchange rates that took place in the reported period as the shekel grew stronger vis a vis the us dollar and the euro is working in the benefit of the company in terms of the imported inputs while eroding the selling prices in those areas in the company whose prices are denominated in us dollars the portfolio of the hadera paper group including the associated companies is relatively balanced and the companys exposure to sharp fluctuations in currency exchange rates is consequently low
2964157 with the successful promotion of the new product we believe that we will benefit greatly from this newly formed market and will surely have a prosperous outcome

2964160 the department has made some moves in the right direction and for these we are thankful
2964161 but the measures are baby steps when what we need are significant strides so consumers can feel confident that they or their loved one will be well cared for by adequate amounts of appropriately trained staff in safe and accessible facilities these regulations just do not do cover all the critical bases
2964162 about 50 000 people currently live in facilities that may call themselves assisted living facilities they are our mothers our husbands grandparents and our friends the regulations must protect them and give their families confidence that their loved ones are well cared for and the public must speak out to make sure the final regulations do just this
2964163 here is our opportunity we need to get this right pennsylvanias families deserve to know that they can trust pennsylvanias assisted living facilities to safely and appropriately care for their loved ones and that the state is committed to ensuring that the facilities fulfill this promise
2964164 the noise was unbearable it was like a drag queens party
2964165 we view receipt of the certificate of occupancy for the main production building as the official beginning of the testing and start up process at our initial production module in clarkdale
2964166 in coming weeks we will complete the final electrical and plumbing work necessary to operate and test individual equipment components and sequential production circuits our technical team looks forward to running slag material through the grinding crushing circuit and utilizing our well equipped laboratory to conduct immediate on site analyses of leaching results in order to further optimize the metals extraction process
2964167 i am pleased to report that we are on track to complete construction of the ew building in the fourth quarter
2964168 construction of this building installation of the copper zinc electrowinning equipment and integration of the ew system into the production process will comprise the final milestone in the completion of a fully functioning production module that can run as a continuous circuit from start to finish the company will use the time during which the ew building is under construction to fine tune the grinding filtering leaching and precious metals extraction circuits
2964169 we continue to work with a team of over fifty consultants and equipment suppliers from around the world to develop design construct and soon operate the first clarkdale production module bringing this facility on line is a complicated process of systems integration and while there are defined milestones along the way the timing of specific events is often difficult because each such event is inextricably tied to so many others however it remains the companys goal to have a complete and operating module before the end of 2008
2964170 once the metals recovery module is fully tested and optimized we will retain an independent engineering firm to conduct a formal commercial feasibility certification completion of such certification will allow us to determine critical aspects of our development and expansion strategy
2964171 popcorn is a contentious issue lots of people absolutely hate it and have asked us to ban it
2964172 if the trial is a success and ive no reason to suspect it wont be well roll it out across other cinemas where it will be appropriate
2964173 people either love or hate popcorn it makes sound business sense to cater to both these audiences
2964174 the big lebowski has been an unprecedented fan favorite since it made its theatrical debut a decade ago and its popularity shows no signs of slowing down
2964175 the films devoted followers are among the most avid and loyal weve ever seen this special 10th anniversary edition is both a tribute and a response to their unbelievable support for the film
2964176 we are quite pleased with our performance this past quarter
2964177 we have delivered another strong quarter and we see exciting times ahead on the back of our successful private placement of 3 5 million shares closed on june 24 we were able to complete the acquisition of weihai hengda electric motor co ltd which added a third major product line rotary motors to our product portfolio
2964178 our current major focus at hengda is to ensure that its management team has all the support and resources necessary to complete the existing supply contracts for the year which should grow revenues and earnings by 30 over 2007 next we will gradually improve manufacturing efficiency and optimize product mix by bringing in new technologies and developing higher grade new products over the next few years to this effect a special team led by our chief technology officer mr okawa will conduct a thorough study of manufacturing processes and technologies at hengda identify opportunities issue recommendations and assist with the execution of the plan
2964179 in shanghai the construction of the main building of our new facility has been completed
2964180 core production lines and equipment have arrived and we are scheduled to conduct equipment adjusting and testing and start trial runs with all our people in shanghai moving in to the new facility on october 15 while we have been a bit delayed we are working hard to meet our commitment to our major north american customer magna international inc to have a minimum capacity of 1 million units ready at shanghai by december this year we have scheduled three micro motor lines to be produced at shanghai for magna these micro motors including applications for car seats door locks and engines have all been successfully developed and validated by magna we estimate that the market potential for these micro motors could reach a total of 500 million for the next four years
2964181 our tower type oil pump project for daqing oil field is on track with 39 units completed in the first quarter and 80 in the second quarter we expect to complete 200 units for the whole year
2964182 our linear motor driven subway train project progressed quite well i am pleased to report that the subway line between beijing airport and the city started to operate successfully before the beijing olympic games this is a clear validation and recognition by the government of the application of the linear motor technology to urban mass transportation in china i am confident that the development process of chinas own linear motor driven subway train will be accelerated and i expect that it will move to a new stage after the beijing olympics
2964183 with a well established multi faceted growth strategy and multiple projects under way i believe that harbin electric is ideally positioned to capture market opportunities and continuously deliver solid results
2964184 as a whole our current family of subsidiary companies performed very well in the second quarter of 2008 we are pleased with the 47 7 growth in cash flow as compared to the prior year despite a difficult economic environment for the full year given how we currently see our businesses responding to the economy we expect our company to produce between 51 million and 56 million of cash flow these estimates assume retention of the substantial cash on our balance sheet and no additional deployment of this significant capital capacity prior to the end of the year should we be able to consummate an accretive acquisition this year which we hope to do 2008 cash flow would be higher
2964185 from a shareholder point of view we are currently valued at less than seven times the midpoint of our 2008 estimate for cash flow we consider this an attractive valuation for a business with our demonstrated track record and prospects for growth we also pay our shareholders a current yield of approximately 11 while reinvesting the substantial remainder of our cash flow into our business on behalf of our shareholders in addition we provide an extraordinarily high level of reporting transparency allowing shareholders to clearly understand our earnings and cash flow as well as our ability to continue to pay and grow these distributions
2964186 in the second quarter we completed the sale of two subsidiary companies aeroglide and silvue in combination with our sale of crosman in early 2007 we have now proven the value of our underlying businesses through the generation of over 100 million in gains for our shareholders in just over two years in addition these sales provide substantial liquidity for us at a time when the environment provides us ample opportunities to take advantage of our unique financing model our current experience is that we are virtually without competitors in terms of our ability to make attractive acquisitions without dependence on the credit markets we hope to acquire at least one additional platform subsidiary in 2008
2964187 we look for blogs focused on a single issue or theme
2964188 these bloggers are committed and are going to write about these issues anyway so promotion doesnt begin with the book and it wont end after the book is out
2964189 it will be less than a year between the signings and publication of these books we could have published them in three months if we didnt need to prepare for consortium our distributor
2964190 we are trying to make use of the long summer holidays to help these young men and women
2964191 we will try to mobilize support from nongovernmental organizations from the region to cooperate with youth groups in the country to build a bridge of understanding with them
2964192 prohibition of open discussion of security vulnerabilities greatly harms the ability of researchers to function and has a chilling effect not only on publication but on whether some important research is done in the first place greatly stifling scientific advancement

2964228 when the bank boots on the other foot which we reproduce unabridged with acknowledgment bank manager
2964229 hello mrs carefree please sit down would you like a cup of coffee
2964230 im not too sure why you asked to come in but notice your business account is 12 512 this morning against an agreed facility of 12 000 i was going to drop you a line about it but now youre hear i wont have to bother
2964231 actually my visit really wasnt about that i have a cheque here in my favour for 125 381 which my aunt left me as the sole beneficiary of her estate i was about
2964232 just a moment please i came here to discuss with you whether i should lodge this
2964233 but youve assured me in the past that you have no account with any mrs carefree indeed i havent but it occurred to me i might open one now
2964234 come now mrs carefree we have supported you in the past dont you think you
2964235 well the first question i want to ask is what will you do with it
2964236 i would credit to your account of course you might open an investment account with some of it but as a first step it would be credited to your current account
2964237 i dont think you fully understand me what i want to know is what the bank will do with my cheque when you have been prepared to let me have an advance in the past you have always required a fully document case with cash flow forecasts repayment schedules the whole caboodle i thought you might let me have a similar statement
2964238 i dont think i could let you have that your money would become part of the banks general funds to be dealt with in the usual way
2964239 thats whats worrying me how much has the bank lent on risky ventures has it or
2964240 well lets forget that for the moment what security are you offering
2964241 the whole of the bank or just this branch ive looked at the outside and with the
2964242 i think you misunderstand me mrs carefree what i meant was that the standing of
2964243 i seem to remember that you rejected out of hand a statement i made about myself to
2964244 well then what about your personal guarantee i see from the phone book that you
2964245 well we can return to that point later you mentioned putting my money in an
2964246 i couldnt afford to pay the 16 5 percent you were recently charging me and said so but you said it wasnt a question of what i could afford that was the banks rate and if you were to tell the banks directors that i couldnt afford the rate of interest and wouldnt be able to service the loan the the facility would not be approved
2964247 i think you must agree that nothing you have come up with this morning has been very satisfactory i think bank has put money into some very risky loans in the past but you were unable to give me any assurances that it wouldnt be putting my money into areas i consider equally doubtful in the future it seems you have no security that you are willing to offer and are reluctant to give me any personal guarantees on your own admission the bank is unable to afford to pay a rate of interest which gives me any real rate of return i suggest that you reconsider your position carefully and if you can come up with something more realistic come round to my office and submit your revised proposals good morning
2964248 please come in and have a seat would you like a cup of coffee
2964249 i imagine youve come in connection with my queries during our meeting yesterday
2964250 mrs carefree contrary to some alarmist media reports the position of australias
2964251 thanks you so much for troubling to provide these figures there are only one or two questions i would like you to answer the assets of our financial institutions in australia which show such astounding growth what are they made up of
2964252 well apart from the buildings land and fixtures owned by the
2964253 in other words the homes farms factories machines and other physical assets of
2964254 in other words the biggest proportion of the assets of our banks consists of the debts of the australian people backed by their property and production
2964255 well y eees but that is normal commercial procedure any where in the
2964256 oh i understand that however there seems to be some discrepancy i feel in the three years you showed me the total assets of our financial institutions were 1970 38 179 billion 1975 78 98 billion 1980 151 92 billion on the other hand for the same years the total volume of money in australia millions was as follows 1970 14 83 billion 1975 28 93 billion and 1980 49 16 billion shouldnt the two balance in each case the total debt to financial institutions was three times the amount of money in australia it seems a little one sided to me
2964257 passing over that one for the moment then may i ask you this if the security for overdrafts you extend are listed in your balance sheet as assets how would you list the deposit of my 125 512 should i finally decide to make it
2964258 it would come under the heading of the banks liabilities
2964259 could you explain then how you overcome the conventional banking acts under which your bank was chartered which prohibit the lending of liabilities
2964260 well if you believe we cant lend our deposits how on earth do you
2964261 well it was explained quite graphically in the monthly review of a bank we once had in australia called the bank of new south wales may i quote you what it said
2964262 if you are suggesting the banks create money out of nothing you have fallen for those oddball funny money theories peddled by strange organizations like the australian league of rights which were totally discredited back in the thirties
2964263 well you have the advantage of me there just what is the australian league of rights and just who discredited such theories in the thirties
2964264 i see not that your answer helps much if as you say you dont know anything about
2964265 well how do you answer its clear suggestion that trading banks create money from
2964266 there are no small plays when we are doing it
2964267 i really truly believe you work so hard and have come so far that nothing is going to get you off of your preparation
2964268 so you cant let any curveball thrown your way be come a distraction if you do you will regret it do you really want to get derailed about anything

2964282 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2964283 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2964284 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2964285 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2964286 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2964287 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2964288 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2964289 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2964309 but the guineas was a stupid race we had a bad draw and had to wait and wait and it ended up being a bad sort of race i knew this race would suit him but i was surprised when i saw the entries as it is usually much easier we will have to talk to sheikh hamdan tamauyzs owner but the prix jacques le marois would be the obvious race for him
2964310 but the winner has ridden a good race he probably got too far back and ran out of ground hes likely to go to the sussex now hell be able to position himself a bit better there and well have a go at henrythenavigator again

2964359 the cbi along with most other forecasters has been consistently over optimistic about the economic outlook over the past 12 months
2964360 in an ideal world the government would now be in a position to cut taxes or increase spending this is not a sensible option today
2964361 a sharp economic slowdown is a new experience for many people in government and in business its going to be uncomfortable

2964391 i think that those people are in such a tiny tiny minority now with their point of view

2964393 it seems to make sense because the circulation is so low and advertising revenue is minimal because of it
2964394 if they start building up circulation through free theres a good chance theyll be able to put the rates up advertisers are prepared to pay for the free model
2964395 there is price elasticity in the market the times damaged the telegraph years ago by dropping its price but with the freesheets now it is a different market
2964396 they might have to almost triple circulation to get the ad yield to match the loss of cover price
2964397 it would throw a cat among the pigeons in the newspaper market and being the smallest in its sector means it would have the least to lose in terms of cover price revenue but with a depressed ad market i cant see it happening
2964398 if you can get the model right it would can be beautiful as you can pick up numbers and get advertisers
2964399 one of the nationals will go free its purely a matter of time

2964452 i think georgian president mikheil saakashvili knew from the very beginning that russia would invade ossetia after georgian troops were sent there saakashvili did that on purpose and wanted to show the world what russia is like today
2964453 saakashvili is playing his media game for the conscience of the western world the price is high but he is very convincing
2964454 this will distance georgias nato membership in the formal terms but in practice in the geopolitical sense this is strengthening georgias nato perspective
2964455 the kremlin must understand that it is making a dramatic mistake by using force in georgia for the first time since 1991 in a post soviet neighborhood and the international community must consistently explain that to russia
2964456 i still believe the fighting will stop quite quickly because the long term interests remain the same for georgia this is not to resolve the situation by force and for russia basically not to resolve it at all
2964457 i think the tempers will cool and the parties will sit down to the negotiating table and basically return the situation where it was before this conflict
2964458 the disproportion of the forces is so big that the war does not have much sense and basically it is not in either sides interest to continue
2964459 it was not an unreasonable calculation to go for a rapid win but in the end it was a miscalculation
2964460 the capital tskhinvali is relatively small no more than around 25 000 people and they probably thought they could just take it and be done
2964461 they may have calculated that some people would leave the region and flee north to north ossetia but the rest would stay and the problem would basically be resolved
2964462 the russians have been provoking for a long time and i dont doubt that they stoked up the separatists to start attacking
2964463 at the same time if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily and at this stage it seems uncertain that they will stop
2964464 if the russians hadnt intervened and georgia had taken over some south ossetians would have fled but most probably would have been okay and south ossetia probably would have been better off economically and culturally
2964465 as it is now they are looking at being a small outpost on the southern reaches of russia

2964472 clearly playing the role of the aggressor the nato puppet regime of mikhail saakashvili has carried out a midnight sneak attack against russian peacekeepers in the province of south ossetia those peacekeepers have been there for 15 years under an agreement with georgia saakashvili is a prot g and creature of zbigniew brzezinski the foreign policy boss of the barack obama presidential campaign as is explained in my book obama the postmodern coup the making of a manchurian candidate saakashvili was brought to power in 2003 2004 by a people power coup or cia color revolution directed by the brzezinski clan and financed by george soros one of obamas key financial backers in a very real sense it is the obama campaign which has attacked russia in south ossetia

2964475 yo what up son true story real talk hard bodied shanaynay and laquiffa rolled up on jicole and bodied that hoe son for real nahmean
2964476 i got the crackerbread i link with crackers and get some head
2964477 you know i rip tracks plus i look like the black dr syntax
2964478 anyone who has eaten chicken feet put your hand up
2964479 you can turn your back on a person but never turn your back on a drug especially when its waving a razor sharp hunting knife in your eye
2964480 the edge there is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over
2964481 i wish we could have a house like that someday
2964482 it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
2964483 never seen anything like this in my career for software
2964484 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that
2964485 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
2964486 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2964487 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2964488 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2964489 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2964490 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2964491 we are at a pivotal point in social medias development the open social initiatives allowing people to take their profiles with them when they move between sites shows that the major players are willing to play with each other and self regulation is a natural next step
2964492 but in many ways censorship contradicts the ideals of social media but certain lines will need to be drawn to help re establish the excitement and optimism that characterises this medium
2964493 not all of us want to share networks with our dads or work colleagues nor do we want to be bombarded by advertising but there is increasing demand for those sites which provide attractive meeting places for like minded communities music sites hobbies or virtual worlds
2964494 the games sites are the pinnacle of this you cant argue with the fact that 1 of the worlds population has played world of warcraft
2964495 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2964496 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2964497 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2964498 aladdins commitment to supporting all major development environments and operating systems is clearly displayed in the newest version of hasp srm
2964499 java applications are frequently used in mobile phones smart card devices and embedded software development for medical machinery parking pay stations web cameras and games the widespread use of java poses an increased risk to these segments making intellectual property protection an absolute necessity wherever java applications are included
2964500 i never found out who this guy really was or where he came from the more time goes by the more i start to think that maybe just maybe he came from my imagination from some unused portion of my mind where hes now gone back to live
2964501 i hated it when he answered my questions with my own questions and he knew it
2964502 i brought the volume way down and the drummer ralph followed michael stopped playing chords and went to a single note rhythm that really created space it was then that i realized what we were doing we were creating a hole right in the middle of the music that allowed the soloist to stand there out in the open the whole audience stopped what they were doing and started listening to the saxophone solo it was brilliant
2964503 siempre es bonito jugar contra los grandes nombres especialmente cuando te tienes confianza para jugar bien en los grandes torneos es muy pronto para jugar contra el que probablemente sea el mejor jugador del momento pero tambi n es un buen momento para eliminarlo
2964504 un tipo como rafa que est animado cada vez que entra a una pista a n en los partidos de pr ctica o jugando al golf no hace diferencia entre una final o una primera rueda
2964505 eso fue hace algunos a os no hay mucho que se pueda leer de eso el ltimo de ellos en el abierto de australia de 2005 fue a cinco sets y l ya estaba jugando muy bien no hay dudas de que ha mejorado desde entonces
2964506 le pido por favor mir ndola a los ojos que diga qui n se la ha dado la epo porque vamos a ir a por esa persona este da o esta irresponsabilidad se puede rebajar si se dan nombres
2964507 una investigaci n para saber qui n ha suministrado aconsejado o dado la sustancia a la deportista
2964508 aplicaremos con toda la dureza la nueva ley espa ola contra el dopaje llegaremos hasta el final
2964509 inhabilitado o si es necesario metido en la c rcel
2964510 tiene dos laboratorios acreditados por la ama que pasan todos los controles de calidad y el de madrid en concreto est especializado en la detecci n de epo
2964511 el ganador de la vuelta a espa a 2005 fue descubierto y descalificado en madrid
2964512 pero no me quiero comparar con nadie espa a est trabajando fuerte y con mucha tecnolog a estamos en una situaci n mucho mejor de la que est bamos antes
2964513 ser la m xima sanci n posible acompa ada de una investigaci n dirigida a descubrir qui n ha dado esa sustancia a la ciclista
2964514 el cerco se estrecha y para el entorno no es que se estreche es que quiero que acabe en la c rcel o inhabilitado no vamos a bajar la guardia el que la hace la paga y la va a pagar
2964515 al lado del secretario de estado por c mo est trabajando contra el dopaje
2964516 hoy es un momento duro pero no es para echarnos a llorar estamos persiguiendo el dopaje como pocos pa ses en el mundo
2964517 si se han hecho seis controles en el ltimo mes lo que no se puede hacer es perseguir hasta su casa a los corredores para ver qu se toman o qu se inyectan
2964518 defiendo al deporte espa ol y a la federaci n espa ola de ciclismo no vamos a conseguir que nunca haya dopaje pero lucharemos las 24 horas contra l
2964519 nosotros confiamos en los atletas espa oles hay 286 atletas y me quedo con los 285 que no se han dopado
2964520 un seguimiento perfecto para que los deportistas lleguen a las competiciones totalmente limpios
2964521 si tambi n habr a que hacerles controles o ex menes psicol gicos para que no cometan errores en momentos tan cr ticos como lo ha hecho maribel moreno
2964522 el resto del tiempo lo pasamos hablando de asuntos de su vida privada que no voy a comentar
2964523 more or less the side that played against lazio will be the one that plays in the champions league on wednesday in belgium
2964524 most of the senior players were involved this will be the side that plays against standard liege
2964525 the situation has been very difficult for us we have had a lot of players returning to training late after international games in the summer and now we have players at the olympics
2964526 it has given me a chance to see the young players during pre season and i am sure that the future of the club is guaranteed
2964527 i believe we are ready for the champions league tie the experienced players are ready but we know that we have quality from the young players
2964528 but i cannot rest i must continue to work hard during the week
2964529 we played a beautiful game not just me but everyone i am convinced we can give even more though
2964530 the understanding with ibra we have much work to do but i like to play with him and to create spaces with certain movements
2964531 thicot has injured his thigh muscle and i dont know how long it will take before he is back
2964532 it looks a bad one and we are probably looking at weeks rather than days
2964533 joe keenan and david van zanten were just minor injuries they should be okay for next week
2964534 there are not many players like him in the bundesliga he is incredibly fast light footed and strong in one on ones he has really convinced me in pre season his opponents often need fouls to stop him im confident that he will help us
2964535 the best points total we have achieved was 65 so if we could get one more this term and do well in the cup competitions that would be progress
2964536 the rewards of getting there are even greater this season because five clubs will qualify for europe due to our rising coefficient
2964537 as for splitting the old firm we just have to look after ourselves i think rangers are hurting badly right now
2964538 we lost too many of our big players we were poor in wide positions and that left our supporters a bit flat
2964539 well have a meeting on monday about the game to get it out of our systems and its back to business for the game next week
2964540 debemos poner la mayor cantidad de arena para que al equipo de gobierno no le salgan las cosas bien
2964541 farmers markets are a great source of fresh kentucky proud fruits and vegetables many also sell canned goods meat dairy products crafts flowers and other products
2964542 those products are made close to home by your friends and neighbors
2964543 its a different year this year and its because of the economy
2964544 it gives producers an opportunity to sell their goods at fair prices that consumers can afford but is still better than the wholesale market
2964545 more and more people are wanting to know where their products coming from
2964546 theres been more conversation about salmonella as people ask questions about tomatoes and jalapenos
2964547 farmers markets are a wonderful way to promote local agricultural communities and support our kentucky farming families
2964548 locally grown produce has many benefits including greater nutritional value reduced fuel usage which is more environmentally friendly and it keeps money within our local communities
2964549 if they cant attract the anchor stores i dont know how theyre going to get the other stores that are going to rely on them as a destination point
2964550 we will have a down period but were going to do our very best to keep that minimal
2964551 you cant build richmond centre overnight we cant rebuild richmond mall overnight
2964552 hopefully it will be something that the community will be very excited about
2964553 richmond centre is going to be a great asset to the community and its looking better and better as we get more of the construction complete
2964554 those are strong businesses that have been there for awhile
2964555 will be positive for the community because it will bring in money that we would otherwise not have
2964556 ive already told my husband ill be stopping there pretty frequently
2964557 you gotta have a reason to come to the mall
2964558 yo digo que eres un imbecil porque soy libre de decirlo pero como se te ocurra insultarme te corto el cuello

2964569 it may have drawn a line under the big credit losses the capital raising is done and there are synergies to come through from abn but the underlying business is reflecting a tough market particularly in the united states
2964570 its never been this rough to get tech companies to i p o
2964571 were seeing entrepreneurs more than willing to go the acquisition route rather than go public
2964572 when they look at how long a trek it is to go public an i p o is no longer the golden ring
2964573 most tech i p o s tend to be smaller high growth companies with a relatively greater degree of risk
2964574 so it becomes harder to prove themselves to an i p o audience that is looking for a lower amount of risk
2964575 with nine of the last 10 i p o s trading below their initial price companies see this and are willing to wait it out

2964578 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2964579 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2964580 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2964581 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally
2964582 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2964583 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2964584 the georgian gambit of trying to push the russians out of its breakaway border territories seems to have had the opposite effect of consolidating russian control
2964585 its still unclear whether this crisis can be contained with only the destruction and loss of life it has caused so far
2964586 using simple mechanics principles the researchers have produced for the first time electronic devices on a hemispherical surface so that they can take images much like those captured by the human eye
2964587 this strategy opens up exciting new engineering design possibilities by eliminating the two dimensional planar constraints of conventional semiconductor wafer based optoelectronics
2964588 mechanics helps to reduce the stresses and strain in components and guide and optimize the system design
2964589 with my injury and the team being down i was down
2964590 i felt i could help but i couldnt come back that wasnt fun
2964591 after that hiccup in minnesota from there on we were on a roll myself included
2964592 we started to zone in and understand each other as a defense and that was what gave us great success
2964593 that first year starting he was thinking and learning what he should do now he knows what he is doing and learning what offenses throw at him hes a very smart player as well as being a good athlete
2964594 i understand now what it takes to be a professional
2964595 i thought i knew but its the week in week out rigors you deal with mentally and physically that are ever changing and its something you need to quickly adapt to
2964596 hes one of my favorites if not my favorite of all time
2964597 i remember when he retired a piece of me felt a little sick about it like golly hes not going to be out here i dont remember the nfl too much without him out there im obviously still a fan of his and i would love to continue to watch to see him play
2964598 obviously he still wanted to play and who can fault him for that
2964599 there has been a lot of players that said they were going to retire and dont retire this is just how it is if he still wants to play he should play whenever we say we are done we want to be done but sometimes it is easier said than done but for the most part when the player really wants to be done he is done
2964600 sometimes situations happen where who knows you are forced to retire or forced out of the league
2964601 but hopefully that wont be my case it dont matter how great you are at some point its time to move on time for the organization to move on it happens to everybody at some point we all have to look within ourselves and say is it right for me to be playing or time to retire i could easily see myself in that position some day
2964602 i dont want to get hurt before the season starts
2964603 they are very important games obviously for a guy like me an undrafted free agent going in my fourth year
2964604 ive got to continue to prove myself show what i can do and how i can help this team out
2964605 its weird because you get a chance to see guys every day and you think how the hell did no one know about him
2964606 he is a small guy and this league is built on height size speed and measureables but those measureables dont look at the player and thats what he falls under being a player
2964607 i joke a lot that i havent been hit in two years
2964608 though its been a while for you it still kind of comes back to you quickly
2964609 thats not my ultimate goal for sure in this thing
2964610 you dont want to sit and back up and be the third team guy your whole career i dont know if patience is the right word here but you just keep pushing and hopefully you get an opportunity
2964611 were respected now but we have to maintain it last year was last year and we have to do it all over again what we did last year doesnt matter
2964612 i think our receiving corps is really good and has the opportunity to be up there with the elite receiving corps in the league whether people think it or not
2964613 our offense is pretty complete with our tight ends and young guys like naanee and craig davis
2964614 chris and vincent are the two best leaders in the group
2964615 they are doing an excellent job of helping the other guys
2964616 he needed to play enough that was our plan coming into this game we go to play on field turf next week and i dont know how much i want him to play
2964617 even when i got sacked there was nothing to it
2964618 those defensive ends are getting faster stronger quicker i got to stay on top of my game
2964619 i just want those guys to play i want them to have a chance to compete and play theyre all good players this is a great experience for them
2964620 there were some holes i probably should have hit and some cuts i should have made but it felt good to get out there and get my feet wet
2964621 i am a bit surprised really but my logic would be that in the last 10 or 15 years we played in lots of divisions
2964622 and when we go to these grounds in the second third or fourth division then we bring an awful lot of supporters to away games and i think that this table is possibly a sign of resentment against us
2964623 plymouth have said that burnley is their most hated side and they are 300 miles away
2964624 that could be because we relegated them once on the last day of the season and then spoiled their glory days when we beat them in the play offs in another season
2964625 the same thing applies to stockport i think there is a little bit of jealousy there
2964626 we go to a lot of clubs now and there is no trouble never an ounce of bother
2964627 i find it quite amusing its just like the song no one likes us we dont care
2964628 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2964629 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2964630 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2964631 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2964632 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2964633 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2964634 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2964635 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2964636 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
2964637 isaac hayes was a wonderful human begin and his spirit will live long in the form of his music
2964638 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2964639 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2964640 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2964641 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2964642 you told me more about the process than i know
2964643 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2964644 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2964645 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2964646 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2964647 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2964648 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2964649 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2964650 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2964651 we kunnen echter ook niet altijd slalommen in de lucht
2964652 wij balen er ook van als er een koe in de sloot belandt of als een paard over een hek springt

2964657 far from pleased especially as safety standards are much lower than at home
2964658 but you must remember that millions travel every year and these horror stories are so rare in rio for example you may get pick pocketed but its unlikely youre going to die and after all people get mugged on a daily basis in london or barcelona
2964659 but you simply have to be aware of this the risks of a gap year dont outweigh the benefits in my opinion
2964660 bear in mind you may have to adjust your behaviour and dress or act differently
2964661 nowadays there is a well trodden backpacker route and close to two million 18 30 year olds take it annually
2964662 statistics from 2001 indicated that it was safer to take a gap year than to go to university
2964663 we were playing long ball we looked nervous and our defending was schoolboy stuff
2964664 but to get the three points is a good sign
2964665 its been a long time coming ive been through a lot the 100th goal was for my family my wife and kids
2964666 you have done well my son but look at the holes in the fence the fence will never be the same when you say things in anger they leave a scar just like this one you can put a knife in a man and draw it out it wont matter how many times you say im sorry the wound is still there a verbal wound is as bad as a physical one

2964696 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
2964697 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
2964698 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
2964699 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
2964700 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
2964701 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
2964702 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
2964703 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
2964704 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
2964705 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
2964706 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
2964707 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
2964708 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
2964709 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
2964710 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
2964711 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
2964712 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
2964713 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
2964714 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
2964715 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
2964716 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
2964717 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
2964718 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
2964719 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n

2964790 at the center of this controversy are medical communications firms paid by pharmaceutical and device companies to produce physician education courses critics say the manufacturers hire the marketing firms as intermediaries to help them influence doctors prescriptions and procedures
2964791 an untold number of people have been rejected for medical coverage for a reason they never could have guessed insurance companies are using huge commercially available prescription databases to screen out applicants based on their drug purchases most consumers and even many insurance agents are unaware that humana unitedhealth group aetna blue cross plans and other insurance giants have ready access to applicants prescription histories these online reports available in seconds from a pair of little known intermediary companies at a cost of only about 15 per search typically include voluminous information going back five years on dosage refills and possible medical conditions the reports also provide a numerical score predicting what a person may cost an insurer in the future
2964792 despite recommendations nearly 60 percent of health care workers do not wash hands while on duty why for one thing rigorous hand washing is time consuming guidelines advise that we first rinse then soap for 20 seconds then rinse again for 30 seconds after this we paper dry our hands and turn the faucet off using the paper towel for health care workers the procedure is supposed to be followed before and after every patient encounter that means two minutes per patient visit which adds up to an hour for a doctor who sees an average 30 patients a day and 2 1 2 hours per shift for an icu nurse
2964793 starting in october hospitals will be penalized for the consequences of unwashed hands medicare will no longer pay for complications arising from certain hospital acquired infections which in many cases result from poor hand hygiene this will be a powerful incentive for health executives to improve hand washing compliance

2964808 coddles big tobacco while protecting the industrys best tools to recruit and addict your children to tobacco
2964809 trying to make cigarettes safer through a billion dollar bureaucracy is a waste of time and money
2964810 the right approach is to get people to stop smoking or better yet never to start
2964811 tobacco is one of the biggest contributors to our nations growing health care crisis we need to fight the war on tobacco head on not sign a peace treaty with philip morris a company that perpetuates and profits from the crisis big tobacco supports this bill because they have a stake in maintaining the status quo i dont theyre happy with a bill that doesnt stop people from smoking im not i want real change so im going to fight this bill and its big tobacco backers by objecting to it in the senate
2964812 enzi noted that the bill would allow big tobacco to continue its aggressive marketing to kids by exempting menthol from a list of banned flavorings
2964813 last year during help committee consideration of this bill i filed several amendments addressing the menthol issue
2964814 we know that big tobacco targets children and teenagers particularly young african americans by aggressively marketing menthol cigarettes to them
2964815 so why does this bill ban almost every type of flavoring in tobacco products except menthol supporters of this bill claim they want to protect children and families from unscrupulous tobacco companies but the only people this approach protects is big tobacco
2964816 philip morris the nations largest cigarette maker helped draft the bill
2964817 poison peddlers shouldnt get to decide how we fight the war against their deadly products i urge my friends in the public health community not to become so desperate to do something about the tobacco problem in this country that they fall for this wolf in sheeps clothing
2964818 keep asking yourself if this bill is good for big tobacco how can it be good for public health the fact is it cant this bill is nothing more than a marlboro protection act written to keep philip morris at the top of the tobacco market
2964819 the legislation represents a compromise among major anti smoking groups and some tobacco companies including philip morris usa the nations largest the bill has the support of a majority of senators but its unclear whether it will become law this year because the bush administration has threatened a veto
2964820 it would let tobacco companies begin selling a new product provided they file a report with the fda showing why the new product is similar to an existing one that could be done at any time in the 21 months after enactment of the legislation

2964836 like the dozens of other jailed syrian activists aref dalila should never have been arrested in the first place
2964837 hes finally free but far too many others languish in syrias prisons just because they criticized the government
2964838 syria needs to stop its revolving door detention policy of arresting an activist each time another is released
2964839 its time for president bashar al asad to recognize the right of syrians to criticize his policies
2964840 joint replacements used to be limited to the elderly but not anymore
2964841 the bottom line is boomers are more active and were seeing more of these high impact injuries that are otherwise more common in a younger population
2964842 it was very uncommon to see so many people become avid runners into their 60s and 70s a generation ago
2964843 but its very common now to have middle aged people take up such a high endurance sport and run at a much later age

2964846 a congestion pricing plan is the most cost effective way to jump start transit improvements and reduce traffic congestion
2964847 our findings have long term implications for how we teach negotiation
2964848 men who try to make a positive impression by being conciliatory risk forfeiting their own economic outcomes and women who try to make positive impressions by being assertive can risk damaging their relationships thus men and women may benefit from different strategies when it comes to balancing the tension in negotiation between empathy and assertiveness
2964849 the goal of the assessment should guide the choice of the assessment tools used and assessments that will have widespread effects should meet high standards of rigor and validity
2964850 for example using a standardized test with a sample of children in a program would be suitable if the goal was to determine whether the program is bringing children closer to national norms but if the purpose is to guide instruction within a specific classroom a nonstandardized assessment linked to the curriculum would be appropriate

2964852 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2964853 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2964854 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2964855 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2964856 you told me more about the process than i know
2964857 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2964858 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2964859 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor

2965004 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2965005 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2965006 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2965007 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2965008 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2965009 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2965010 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2965011 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2965157 no of course not all that im saying is that each time should prove that youre doing better than the time before not that youre declining i mean if you really care for the person youre finally seeing again in fact that would be true for people you always hated to youd probably want them to be jealous of you or something so you would still be doing at least as good or better than you ever were before see theres no reason at all to not do better the further down in life you go artists do the same thing their movies tend to get better their music tends to become more complex

2965192 so eager were jean chretien and paul martin to placate the tamil voting blocks in scarborough and other urban liberal strongholds that they refused on numerous occasions to add the tigers to canadas list of outlawed terror groups this made it difficult for police and security services to move against front organizations they felt were acting as money conduits for the tigers
2965193 the tigers terror campaign is often overlooked in the west because their attacks are not directed at western targets still the tigers are a very nasty bunch over the past two decades their civil war with the sri lankan government has resulted in a combined total of over 60 000 deaths

2965214 the prime minister of new zealand angrily denounced israel and imposed diplomatic sanctions on it after two suspected mossad agents were jailed for six months for trying on false grounds to obtain a new zealand passport the plot which involved obtaining a passport in the name of a tetraplegic man who had not spoken in years provoked a furious reaction yesterday
2965215 in 2004 new zealand authorities became aware of a covert operation mounted by israels external intelligence agency mossad to secure nz passports which are keenly sought after by those who seek hassle free entry to most countries
2965216 the spy ring consisted of at least three mossad agents working from australia it later emerged that australia secretly expelled an israeli diplomat as a result of this scandal in nz and one new zealand jew
2965217 they duly pleaded guilty to a single charge and served three months of a six month sentence before being deported back to israel they were also each ordered to make a 50 000 payment to the cerebral palsy association as they had sought the passport in the name of an nz cerebral palsy sufferer
2965218 it is time to bring drugs to everyone in need regardless of who they are where they live and how much they earn we need universal access now
2965219 however that trend appears to have stabilised in the early 2000s and there are now concerns that the hiv epidemic could grow again
2965220 today the emphasis is on care and support of aids patients antiretroviral drugs arvs are available people no longer fear death from aids
2965221 it is about issues of complacency the availability of drugs has caused a negative effect to some extent people know that they will get treatment even if they get aids
2965222 forcing us to turn away from our original abc strategy in favour of the universal access
2965223 universal access puts emphasis on condoms treatment and a cottage industry of rights like gay rights stigma rights it minimises the role of prevention through behavioural change abstinence and faithfulness
2965224 we used to say aids kills but now when you say aids kills they say you are creating stigma we have a big conflict between the western approach based on human rights against ugandas approach which was based on prevention the social vaccine we have abandoned behavioural change people are no longer afraid of hiv aids
2965225 we are no longer emphasising key things there is noticeable reduction in prevention pressure which we should address todays messages are not scaring enough to bring to people the reality of aids and death

2965285 ever since we started mining tanzanite we have managed to venture at just 600 meters below in south africa gold is being extracted at an underground depth of about five kilometers below and still going
2965286 if you are well equipped then there is no limit to the amount of tanzanite to be found but for the miners with shoddy gears then the end could indeed be nigh
2965287 you see the center is also going to serve as gemstone trading area a venture that requires maximum security
2965288 when people hear about how john has changed the lives of so many people not just the three recipients but also their families this is giving people the opportunity to talk about donation
2965289 the most important thing we have to say to people is to make your wishes known because we have to ask the families left behind if they dont know what that wish was then its very difficult for people to make that decision at such a critical time

2965308 it wasnt an overdose i had a bad experience it was nowhere near an overdose it was blown completely out of proportion i never overdosed
2965309 drugs for me are something i dont normally meddle in i have tried drugs in my life im not going to deny it but i dont need to go to rehab because i never and will never have any sort of habit with drugs

2965321 sienna is being portrayed as a femme fatale and fears for her career because hollywood hates a homewrecker
2965322 she hopes balthazar can get rosetta to put out a statement saying their marriage was already over they have already got friends to speak out saying he was sleeping on their sofas
2965323 its nonsense that the marriage was already over when balthazar went away in may rosetta thought it was to see his sick mom in germany but she now knows that it was to cavort with sienna in prague
2965324 i love sienna i think shes a wonderful actress but weve been like two passing ships in the night recently
2965325 i think thats lovely but also sad about acting you get incredibly close to people and as soon as its over you dont see each other
2965326 i dont think im very good at figuring out female friendships i think theyre quite tricky to navigate

2965359 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2965360 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2965361 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2965362 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally
2965363 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2965364 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2965365 the georgian gambit of trying to push the russians out of its breakaway border territories seems to have had the opposite effect of consolidating russian control

2965373 migs crm approach chimed perfectly with our need to retain monthly donors by launching a light touch communications channel we are able to reinforce their decision to support shelter with good news about where their money goes in helping homeless and badly housed people

2965381 they claim its been going in budget support but thats not the answer were talking about 700 million dollars a year missing the rest has been taken by mush for some scheme or other and weve got to find it

2965388 abhinav has vindicated our belief that shooting is indeed one of the big sports where india can look forward to a great deal of success we had been winning a lot of medals in international competitions but now success has started coming in world championships and olympics too rajyavardhan rathores silver medal in 2004 and now this gold from abhinav will change the face of indian sport
2965389 cricket rules the roost in india but now the youngsters have a role model who plays some other sport its great for us and it augurs well for us

2965432 when i began working with libbie the summer before she started college she really dug into the details of the organisms processes and previous research by others concerning bioplastics
2965433 by the time she started college she was well into research and discovery in the laboratory
2965434 using wastes to make bioplastics solves two problems at the same time
2965435 it provides sustainable waste treatment and avoids polluting the environment second by adding a high value product like bioplastic to the biodiesel production process the cost of both products can simultaneously be lowered
2965436 if theres anything ive learned while working on this project its that everyone has to work together
2965437 no one can know everything so you have to team up with experts from various disciplines to get the best results
2965438 id like to shift to a systems integration emphasis for my masters degree
2965439 i want to design a system for bioplastic production that can be incorporated into the commercial agricultural waste treatment process without compromising biodiesel production

2965446 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
2965447 there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2965448 maybe its so bad it has actually wrapped all the way around and its good again

2965450 i didnt recognize you you looked like a european model or something
2965451 i was positioned in the second tier of the stand in the front row on the opposite side to the main stand
2965452 i didnt see the rehearsal but i was aware that the torch bearer would run around the top of the stadium before finally lighting the olympic flame i had no idea how it was going to look but it turned out well from my position
2965453 a lot of luck is needed if li ning had lit the flame in a different spot i would have missed it completely i chose a long lens for this section of the ceremony and it paid off the projection of colour that followed the flame around the stadium really made this picture
2965454 i shot all aspects of the ceremony from the drummers at the start to the fireworks at the end and of course the teams entering the stadium
2965455 fireworks always make for great pictures but looking back at the ceremony the lighting of the flame was the highlight four years on from athens and the olympic torch finally reached its destination at the beijing olympic games
2965456 we didnt think the weather was going to hold out for us we ended up waiting until 12pm to see what it was like before we went ahead
2965457 everyone really enjoyed it we had 65 people in the parade and there were hundreds watching
2965458 we got some sponsorship to get a monster music workshop down they built a musical instrument from bits of scrap metal and shopping trolleys that children could play they loved it everyone expected a brass band but because we changed the date of the carnival we couldnt get it but the monster music workshop saved the day
2965459 we would like to reassure the public that incidents of this type are very rare in west cumbria
2965460 we do not believe it is connected in any way with the sexual assault in moss bay
2965461 i spoke to alan after saturdays contest and hes enjoying it all enjoying the experience hes in high spirits still

2965463 we do believe that we have the basis of a settlement we meet the company tomorrow and hope to bottom it out then
2965464 the company threatened us with a legal challenge if we balloted today

2965469 one in five calls we get relate to people doing the three peaks challenge
2965470 its a real problem it would be fair to say that the ones we meet underestimate whats involved in doing the mountain particularly at night
2965471 they often dont have warm clothing no map or compass no torch we dont go out to provide a free guide service but we have to assess whether they are at risk of coming to harm
2965472 the authority has the ability to publicise the fact that people doing the challenge on this scale are not welcome
2965473 we need to tell people to find three other mountains and spread the load a bit at the moment its all concentrated on here
2965474 they get themselves some cheap gear and a large proportion of them have no mountain walking experience
2965475 they decide to raise some money for charity and come here

2965477 our test purchasers clearly looked under 18 were not trying to hoodwink retailers were trying to make sure they follow the law
2965478 the legal age for buying a knife was raised from 16 to 18 last year and its important that retailers understand the implications of breaking the law
2965479 fortunately knife crime is relatively low in cumbria but we need to ensure that this remains the case and we will be continuing our vigilance on this issue throughout the county in the coming months
2965480 we have one of the lowest number of incidents involving knives or blades in the country and thankfully we do not experience gang related violence
2965481 we are not complacent however and we are working with partner agencies on initiatives like this to discourage the use of knives to ensure that cumbria remains a safe place to live and visit

2965506 we have resolved to endure the unendurable and suffer what is insufferable
2965507 anything is possible but you have to believe and you have to fight

2965702 really only proven with quarterbacks when they play in a game and we dont have any games to play before aug 30 so it might take some games to find out exactly who the one quarterback is or who the two are that we should plan on playing however it works itself out
2965703 these three guys all have basically the same game whereas last year jameel was a little bit different than the guy who was going in for him
2965704 so for me i had to think two different games whereas this year if we were to put another guy in were going to call from the same sheet
2965705 fantastic newswhat a glorious gift for every indian just finished our show in chicago to a rousing reaction but nothing can top this news

2965709 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
2965710 we did not accept military intervention by milosevics serbia in other yugoslav states on the grounds of protecting serbian passport holders
2965711 recognizing kosovo will bring nothing but trouble no one can be denied the right to self determination but only within the bounds of common sense
2965712 with its irresponsible behaviour is causing new divisions in europe and globally and undermining international relations
2965713 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thy heart that god has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved
2965714 for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him

2965717 megan claimed she felt threatened by macy but that dog was a sweetheart
2965718 brian adored macy and refused to give her up for the longest tie but megan nagged him about it until he finally gave in he was crushed
2965719 its pretty apparent that forcing brian to get rid of macy was just a way of throwing her weight around
2965720 very exicited to be able to put a new twist on it

2965771 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2965772 the strengthening of the peacekeeping force is aimed at ruling out a repetition of the situation russian peacekeepers faced in tskhinvali
2965773 our troops have to defend civilians and avert a humanitarian catastrophe
2965774 we do not plan to break into georgian territory beyond the borders marked to the peacekeepers
2965775 the war in georgia is a war for the west
2965776 victory at the next parliamentary elections is our most important task now
2965777 why are they undertaking measures against bulgaria if they can go around our country then they do not have a problem
2965778 they are preparing the situation this clique around the bulgarian socialist party and the movement for rights and freedoms so that if something happens with me they would be able to attribute it to some conflicts in the past
2965779 brussels cannot replace governments because this would be considered interference with the countrys internal affairs so we chose a language that all people all over the world understand we stopped you money
2965780 the republican road infrastructure fund rrif is the only beneficiary of the entire priority operational
2965781 we have a long standing commitment to this work we have unparalleled expertise and we have demonstrated that we can pull people and resources together to make things happen

2965784 the threat to kansas isnt nbaf being here its nbaf not being here
2965785 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2965786 a new chemical probe can rapidly detect ricin a deadly poison with no known antidote that is feared to be a potential weapon for terrorists and cannot quickly be identified with currently available tests
2965787 we found a chemical reporter that detects a relatively rare event one that is related to the action of the toxin
2965788 our reporter probe shows that the reaction is taking place
2965789 when theres no toxin there will be no light emission
2965790 now that we have an assay that senses the toxins activity we can try to discover inhibitors of the toxin or antidotes
2965791 every story has two sides if i listen to his side thats fine and we will get on with things
2965792 he knows ultimately that the team is what is important first and foremost he has to try to earn himself a place in the team
2965793 he has to work very hard and be very focussed on trying to help the team
2965794 im sure he sees this as a new challenge and one in which he would hope to make a good impression so he has to get on with it
2965795 we have worked long and hard on it so ultimately were delighted that he has signed
2965796 we are looking forward to getting on with it i dont get over excited about new signings
2965797 they have to be part of the jigsaw puzzle we are putting together
2965798 he brings power pace and size and the experience of being in the premier league having played there in a team that did reasonably well
2965799 he is another international and lets hope the qualities he possesses can help the team
2965800 theyve asked us to get all his siblings tested and the doctors are waiting for the results of those tests before they decide what sort of treatment to give him they just said its really important that we get her back
2965801 i has to rush him to hospital on tuesday because he had chest pains
2965802 they discharged him and wed just got to the corner of our road when they phone him and said we had to go back because they had found something in his blood hes been in the hospital ever since
2965803 its really hard at the moment we dont know whats happening hes stuck in hospital sometimes hes quite depressed sometimes he seems to be quite jolly
2965804 as far as most decent people are concerned the cenotaph is sacrosanct and not a place to sit on throw things at or draw on
2965805 we would expect people who commit any such outrages to be severely punished
2965806 such things were unheard of until about 10 years ago but its just part of the world were living in the attitude is we dont care were not part of the community
2965807 weve seen more and more people attend remembrance ceremonies in recent years and this is a real slap in the face
2965808 he hasnt been to a match for a while because he hasnt been very well but he had the vip treatment on saturday it was wonderful
2965809 i wanted to do something to surprise him and mentioned it to my friend john ohara who organised it all we told him he was going for a walk so he got all dressed up in his walking boots and when we got there he was so excited
2965810 i said last year when i was 99 if i live to be 100 its going to be with my friends here so my family will come here for lunch tomorrow

2965824 there is nothing more gratifying than being able to share the joys of our lives with the ones closest to us
2965825 with busy schedules and physical distances photos and videos play an integral part in how we communicate in todays digital world roxio online brings families together by not only making it easier than ever to create unique stories to instantly share with relatives across the globe but also by providing a complete storytelling platform that appeals to any memory keeper
2965826 for a mistake to be made once is bad enough but for it to have happened twice is appalling we have lost a sister who did not know the meaning of illness
2965827 that would serve to significantly reduce the possibiity of any future patient and their family sharing a similar experience
2965828 volunteering here has become a huge part of my life ever since my wife died
2965829 i get great satisfaction in leading a tour and meeting new people it really is a wonderful place
2965830 its a fascinating place with a really dramatic story to tell
2965831 these young people have fitted in really quickly and easily and are helping out in different areas as with existing volunteers the new ones volunteer because they have a keen interest in heritage and conservation
2965832 it is a great experience for them to see behind the scenes here at moseley and become part of our team
2965833 i phoned every few months to check everything was ok and was repeatedly told there was no problem but ever since we have been trying to get it delivered weve faced numerous problems and no one is returning my calls
2965834 we did not own the company at the time this order was placed and we dont have any records for that time
2965835 but we would be happy to work with the family
2965836 it is sad that the views of local people were not listened to when the decision was made to close the library
2965837 the council said it did not have the money to renovate the building but i am sure people could have worked together to find the necessary funds
2965838 the campaign to save the building is still going people of woodside still want to save the building and people are still writing to the council to try and protect this important historical building
2965839 we thought very seriously about all the libraries and we believe we are taking the libraries into the 21st century
2965840 the opening of the second library link follows the successful opening of the service at dudley wood and will offer the same flexible service
2965841 dudley wood library link has been open for just over a week and we have received many positive comments about this new service
2965842 i hope this will be mirrored in the woodside area when the new link opens there

2965852 additionally sprint nextels iden wireless network is used by public safety workers something that may worry some washington security officials particularly in an election season which is right around the corner
2965853 the challenge is that sprints financial situation no matter what its representatives claim is not strong
2965854 it isnt any secret that the company has been struggling with lost revenue and lost customers while google could in effect turn it around the real question is does it want to take on the role of savior where sprint is concerned
2965855 i tend to think it does make sense for google to make such an acquisition and i hope they do it soon because i have no faith that our government would stop other large wireless providers from picking sprint up and in doing so reducing competition by that much more
2965856 but according to a cnbc report sprint nextel is already in talks to sell the network to former nextel communications inc subsidiary nii holdings inc or to private equity investors
2965857 the report did not name any sources and said that the sale isnt expected any time soon others have reported that interested parties could include the public safety community which currently relies on the iden network for some of their services this possibility has been questioned as the current iteration of sprint nextels iden network was not constructed to handle the possible load capacity of the public safety community in times of a disaster

2965870 in general the elections were very very peaceful and the turnout is very very good
2965871 i think the people there were excited to use the new system so they went out to vote

2965876 whether thaksin really changed thailand or not we will have to wait and see in the coming months
2965877 the theory that all thailands political problems occurred because of thaksin will soon be proved wrong
2965878 the real problem of the divide between political parties and the elite hasnt gone way
2965879 one year ago the financial world changed completely as the credit crunch took hold today the world of mortgages is a completely different place
2965880 the standard factors which usually determine the rates at which mortgage rates are set including bank base rate swap rates and libor rates are all much lower than this time last year yet the rates on offer are much higher
2965881 as house prices continue to fall and the risk of default increases the lenders are pricing more for risk and as a result these standard factors are not quite as influential on the rates as they once were
2965882 the number of products will steadily increase and rates will lower with increased competition between lenders however it will be a while before lenders regain a healthy appetite to lend with the maximum ltvs on offer largely determined by the future decline in property values
2965883 with all the above said it is highly unlikely that we will ever get back to the same levels that we were at a year ago

2965904 id be very eager to publish the senator on the op ed page however im not going to be able to accept this piece as currently written id be pleased though to look at another draft let me suggest an approach
2965905 it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obamas piece to that end the article would have to articulate in concrete terms how senator mccain defines victory in iraq it would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory with troops levels timetables and measures for compelling the iraqis to cooperate and it would need to describe the senators afghanistan strategy spelling out how it meshes with his iraq plan
2965906 we have elections in this country not coronations and its unfortunate that the new york times wouldnt allow their readers to hear from john mccain and make their own judgment
2965907 tobacco remains the no 1 cause of preventable death in the u s period

2965910 were just saying theres enough scientific evidence that there is no safe place for secondhand smoke

2965918 jessica simpson might have a right to wear what she wants but she doesnt have a right to eat what she wants eating meat is about suffering and death some people feel like they are standing up against a tide of political correctness when they make a statement like this what she is really doing is standing up for the status quo

2966025 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2966026 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2966027 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2966028 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2966029 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2966030 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2966031 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2966032 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2966038 allows us the opportunity to secure our future in an increasingly difficult industrial and economic environment
2966039 there are those who would suggest that we would be better served by simply rejecting this agreement that all we have to do is simply go back and get more
2966040 or they argue the agreement favors the northwest pilots over the delta pilots in one respect or another but upon closer analysis these views are many times based on a misunderstanding of the agreement a misinterpretation of its terms a failure to acknowledge todays economic realities or simply anger
2966041 we realize that tibet is in the news because of the olympic games but we will not allow the world to forget tibet just because the olympic games have ended
2966042 we believe that after the world has seen chinas showcase of digitizing its people during the opening ceremony we can expect much greater participation in our next light protest
2966043 our people are already working on getting the appropriate permits from police and local authorities around the world
2966044 the candle for tibet initiative is a most wonderful thing fitting in with the tibetan tradition of lighting votive lamps in long rows in temples and in special butter lamp houses outside we seem powerless to ameliorate conditions on the ground in tibet in the present crisis moment this peaceful prayer vigil since it focuses the minds of many millions on the different sufferings of tormented and tormentor alike is a powerful way to intervene and it does not preclude anything else we can think of and do further on i hope everyone who reads this will join in this important effort
2966045 we have been receiving fantastic reports from all over the world
2966046 when i woke up on friday i had more than 1 200 e mails waiting from participants wanting to share how their local vigils went it was a simply amazing collective global event
2966047 ik vind fotoshoots maar niks ik begrijp je associatie met een sombermansactie wel maar echt ik wilde gewoon de eerste zijn die ermee weg kwam om op zijn debuut alleen zijn voeten op de cover te hebben
2966048 dat geldt niet voor de andere songs die zijn helemaal mijzelf en alles wat erin gebeurt heeft een directe relatie met mij
2966049 voor my baby heb ik een flink deel gestolen van een song van ella fitzgerald die toch maar half af was het loopt alleen een beetje uit de hand met de zang er wordt wel veel geschreeuwd h platenmaatschappijen vinden het niet leuk als je een plaat begint met een langzaam nummer en dan meteen dat liedje er achteraan dat van een gedicht is overgenomen not funny at all haha
2966050 lang verhaal maar het komt uit een optreden van carolyn mark ze zei op het podium dat michael jackson het recht moest hebben om zich aan kindertjes te vergrijpen toen werd het stil in de zaal daarna zei ze dat alles wat ze vervolgens zou zeggen als een leugen opgevat zou worden voor mij een uitgangspunt voor een song ik schreef marco polo en dacht aan haar
2966051 refreinen schrijven daar ben ik geloof ik niet goed in maar ik weet hoe een lied moet beginnen hoe je iemand een verhaal intrekt ik schrijf alles zelf in afzondering daarna neem ik het mee naar mijn band want ik speel nog net zo gitaar als op mijn veertiende begrijp je
2966052 met de amerikaanse cultuur en de amerikaanse president heb ik helemaal niets
2966053 ik toer liever in europa dan dat ik in amerika rondtrek
2966054 iemand zei me dat het eruit zag als de canadese versie van 9 11 twee graansilos op het platteland waarvan de eerste al in vuur en vlam staat dat is een interessante benadering vind je niet
2966055 cant quite believe the world has lost one of the most entertaining men ive ever met

2966058 lost for words andy will always remember you as the top lad in our class a great mate who lived down the road and more recently one of plymouths finest fans
2966059 my deepest sympathy to your family and friends how to put it in words i dont think i can
2966060 you are an aspiring booze intellectual and a social drinker you are curious and want to know more about the booze you enjoy
2966061 there is still a lot to experience and experiment but you are a quick learner and can soon become an alcoholic elite
2966062 just a lad who likes a good time likes all the finer things in life
2966063 i am still in total shock about my friend mr p larger than life character will have them all partying upstairs in heaven rip andy will never forget you
2966064 hey hey my handsom man im missing you sooooooooo much can not wait for you to get home
2966065 your going to love the new house you owe me one big night out mr piper new shoes new dress the works ha ah bloody loves you piperxx xx x x x x
2966066 it has been a very difficult time we are all deeply shocked and at the moment we are struggling to take it all in
2966067 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions the wind at the time was a south westerly force 5 7 with a moderate to rough sea state generating a heavy surf
2966068 members of the public entering the sea in these sort of conditions were putting themselves at severe risk no matter how commendable were their intentions
2966069 im not linford christie i am an old man of 78 in not the greatest of health a trip to the shops just two streets away usually takes me ten minutes with a dog without one it will take me twice as long
2966070 dit nummer schreef ik voor mijn eerste vrouw terwijl ik getrouwd was met mijn tweede
2966071 today we will be married and all the freaks that she knows will be there
2966072 these four march of dimes mobile health centers bring preconception prenatal and well baby medical care to pregnant women new mothers and babies who desperately need it
2966073 because our centers are mobile we can bring quality health care where its needed most like st bernard parish
2966074 many of our patients are spanish speaking and because we are bi lingual we can offer these women access to quality health care
2966075 were seeing repeat patients from last year who are pregnant again which speaks volumes to the quality of care we offer
2966076 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of noncombatants in the buildings at that time
2966077 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2966078 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
2966079 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2966080 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2966081 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2966082 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2966083 you told me more about the process than i know
2966084 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2966085 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2966086 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2966087 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2966088 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2966089 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2966090 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2966091 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2966092 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2966093 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2966094 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2966095 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally
2966096 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2966097 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2966098 the georgian gambit of trying to push the russians out of its breakaway border territories seems to have had the opposite effect of consolidating russian control
2966099 its still unclear whether this crisis can be contained with only the destruction and loss of life it has caused so far
2966100 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2966101 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2966102 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2966103 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2966104 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2966105 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2966106 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2966107 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2966108 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac

2966111 the hijab has never been a problem for me in bahrain you grow up with it
2966112 there are more women in sport all the time from countries like qatar and kuwait you can choose to wear the hijab or not for me its liberating
2966113 people see us wearing the scarf and think we ride camels but muslim women can do anything they want
2966114 when i fence im proud that im a muslim its very symbolic for women in my country
2966115 alle beteiligten m ssen jetzt eine friedliche l sung anstreben
2966116 die bundesregierung wird versuchen dies auf diplomatischem weg zu unterst tzen vor allem sind jetzt aber die konfliktparteien gefordert wir brauchen so schnell wie m glich einen waffenstillstand
2966117 wenn er jetzt nicht auf den weg geschickt wird werden wir nat rlich klagen
2966118 wir haben in den vergangenen tagen und wochen gesehen dass wir so nicht weiterkommen wir lassen uns aber von den brasilianern nicht verarschen
2966119 da k nnen sie noch zehnmal weltmeister werden so etwas tut man nicht rafinha spielt bei olympia ohne unsere freigabe das lassen wir nicht l nger zu
2966120 wenn ich es mir heute anschaue war das video ein wenig heller als die echten aufnahmen
2966121 aber die meisten zuschauer dachten es sei echt gewesen damit hat unsere arbeit ihren zweck erf llt
2966122 koalitionen auf landesebene sind pragmatische konsequenzen aus wahlergebnissen sie pr judizieren nichts f r die bundesebene dies gilt besonders jetzt wo wir in deutschland ein f nf parteien system haben

2966125 the taliban uses innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
2966126 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
2966127 there was no intention on my behalf to neglect my duty
2966128 the accident was outside my control at the time of the crash i used all of my might to save the flight mission
2966129 it is impossible for me as the breadwinner in the family to destroy my familys hope
2966130 there was indeed a conversation this morning between mr solana and mr saeed jalili nothing has changed we stick to the two track approach the channels of communication remain open
2966131 we have made our case we will continue to make our case
2966132 i am sure admiral cohen had some reason why he wanted to consider mississippi further on this
2966133 we have confidence that homeland security will pick the best place using objective criteria
2966134 it does worry you about the politics of their decision now
2966135 local backers positive about s a s prospects for biological research lab
2966136 for those of us in monterrey coming to santiago is like going to the beach
2966137 trip to lake a tall order for man who once was the worlds heaviest
2966138 i have a love affair for the disabled the veterans the youth the elderly and the community
2966139 i think the short time ive been talking to the general he does use salty language
2966140 hes someone i do enjoy visiting with because he is dramatic and entertaining and charismatic in the way he transmits messages
2966141 hes astute insightful clever straightforward and candid all those things
2966142 i just think if i can be very bold that i have some leadership skills that i think could match up with those concerns
2966143 it doesnt take a rocket scientist to run an organization like this
2966144 i know what questions to ask on the budget side i definitely know what questions to ask on the operations side i definitely know what questions to ask on the contracting side definitely in the personnel arena
2966145 ive been told by employees ive been told just by facial expressions well wait this knucklehead out theres no way this guy can come in here and do what he thinks he has to do in six months and leave i think theres some question on my credibility theres some question on my approach
2966146 theres some question as to this aint the military what the hell does he know about housing yeah theres no doubt that theres that 1 percent out there thats going to take me to task
2966147 anybody thats in a position like this theres a lot of retaliation theres no doubt theyre watching every step i make
2966148 i mean this is what happens in big guys lanes you just cant make a mistake
2966149 i think once they get confident in who i am and channel their concerns through me i will be able to respond to them to meet their desires
2966150 given the opportunity to work through me and me to work through them once that chain of command is established then i can start to ease their concerns from my foxhole
2966151 the only way im going to get my arms around it is to go out there where the rubber meets the road hug babies kiss people
2966152 hey man i was raised on the west side im a disabled veteran i have elderly parents im old
2966153 i mean how much more experience do i need other than ive been around the block a couple times and havent fallen off too many damn turnip trucks lately
2966154 we welcome any increase in capacity to the texas insurance marketplace
2966155 everybody i know who has had it they keep it
2966156 id be the no 1 guy right off the bat
2966157 its going to take a long time to realize the whole 3 million well never get them all
2966158 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2966159 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2966160 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what homeland security officials were looking for
2966161 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2966162 you told me more about the process than i know
2966163 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2966164 mississippis governor does not know of one homeland security officials are in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2966165 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2966166 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2966167 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2966168 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2966169 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2966170 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2966171 im a bargain person if youve got four kids you have to be
2966172 it was not an unreasonable calculation to go for a rapid win but in the end it was a miscalculation
2966173 the capital tskhinvali is relatively small no more than around 25 000 people and they probably thought they could just take it and be done
2966174 they may have calculated that some people would leave the region and flee north to north ossetia but the rest would stay and the problem would basically be resolved
2966175 the russians have been provoking for a long time and i dont doubt that they stoked up the separatists to start attacking
2966176 at the same time if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily and at this stage it seems uncertain that they will stop
2966177 if the russians hadnt intervened and georgia had taken over some south ossetians would have fled but most probably would have been okay and south ossetia probably would have been better off economically and culturally

2966185 there has been considerable interest in how the new tax chamber will look when it is launched in april 2009 and the project team behind the launch feel that now would be a good time to provide an update to readers of accountingweb co uk

2966193 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2966194 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2966195 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2966196 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally
2966197 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2966198 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2966199 the georgian gambit of trying to push the russians out of its breakaway border territories seems to have had the opposite effect of consolidating russian control
2966200 its still unclear whether this crisis can be contained with only the destruction and loss of life it has caused so far
2966201 im very pleased to have been given a full time contract and it is something that i have wanted and worked for over the last couple of years
2966202 it has been talked about for a while but it was only signed on thursday night
2966203 people have said that its not proper full time football because there are only seven of us but i have seen the improvement made by alan mannus michael gault and peter thompson
2966204 i spoke to peter last week for a bit of advice and he said that it definitely improved him as a player and helped him get his move to stockport county
2966205 alan is established in the northern ireland squad peter will probably become established now too and michael is on stand by for the scotland game next week
2966206 you have to set yourself targets and have something to aim for and my aspirations are to keep playing well for linfield and hopefully get noticed by the international manager
2966207 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2966208 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2966209 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2966210 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2966211 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2966212 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2966213 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2966214 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2966215 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
2966216 isaac hayes was a wonderful human begin and his spirit will live long in the form of his music
2966217 if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
2966218 you definitely had to bring your a game to win a medal and those three guys that beat me did
2966219 were seeing world records get broken like its the easiest thing in the world and its not everyones swimming fast everyones got a smile on his face and its been fun so far
2966220 i thought i had a shot all the way to the wall
2966221 i had two races where i had to be in the top eight where everybody was racing hard in the preliminaries at this point i take one race at a time you cant think about the next until you get there
2966222 i think thats the first time hes worn a jammer in two years
2966223 i hope to talk him into something that will cover more of his body
2966224 i dont want to be the center of attention going into the final
2966225 i dont swim well when im the center of attention
2966226 ive just had a really off year on a really important year and i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me
2966227 im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
2966228 will we go out for dinner or raid the freezer

2966231 the most important thing we have to say to people is to make your wishes known because we have to ask the families left behind if they dont know what that wish was then its very difficult for people to make that decision at such a critical time
2966232 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media

2966234 ronan has come through a lot but his presence at training this past week or so has given everybody a tremendous lift and the fact that he got 20 minutes game time there today was a bonus
2966235 hes a fine footballer and you could see out there the way the rest of the lads lifted their game when he came on
2966236 maybe i didnt get my tyre choice right as the conditions changed virtually from stage to stage but i dont think i could have beaten kevin anyway hes the master round here
2966237 im really pleased with that win i got a lucky break last year but apart from a couple of minor blips this time i got it just about right every stage
2966238 this rally is all about commitment but it is so easy to make a mistake especially with the conditions so greasy i knew mark was back for revenge after what happened last year and im pleased to have beaten him in a fair fight
2966239 he was just the type of player likely to be on montgomery burnss dream softball team from that famous episode of the simpsons so many years ago
2966240 mike mussina pitched seven sharp innings thursday night and held the most powerful offense in the majors scoreless in a 3 0 win over the texas rangers the 39 year old right hander gave up eight hits struck out six and stayed unbeaten in his last seven road outings
2966241 mussina became the first visiting starter to not allow a run at rangers ballpark since last august he has allowed two runs or fewer in seven of his last eight starts and he earned his 15th victory tying clevelands cliff lee for the american league lead
2966242 not only was his final line on thursday one of his best this season but mussina did it against the majors most productive offense in one of the leagues foremost hitters parks he did it in 98 degree heat mowing down josh hamilton and michael young and ian kinsler the three main engines of this rangers offense and he did it by pitching really pitching on a night when his stuff was self admittedly ordinary

2966247 we cant turn the clock back on what should have been a wonderful day on saturday
2966248 what happened has happened now we need to learn from it and move on
2966249 we will get football going again this saturday and then look to review the procedures to ensure that senior football looks after itself and will be responsible for itself and wont see events like this happen again

2966264 the fai views with concern the escalation of hostilities in georgia ahead of next months world cup qualifier match in tbilisi
2966265 we will continue to work closely with the department of foreign affairs fifa uefa and the georgian football association to keep fans informed of any updates and advice from these bodies as they become available
2966266 because of the situation in the georgia south russia region the football association of wales is keeping in close contact with the georgia football federation
2966267 at this time the nationwide international at the liberty stadium swansea is still scheduled to go ahead however we hope to have a further update from tbilisi later this afternoon
2966268 we can confirm that we are closely monitoring the situation in georgia
2966269 at this time it is too early to speculate on any possibilities we are in touch with the member associations

2966273 whilst we note that the imc has been asked to prepare a special report on paramilitary structures including the current status of the ira we will be making our assessment with our own security contacts
2966274 the briefings we receive on a regular basis establish the extent to which the ira has progressed with the dismantling of its paramilitary structures
2966275 it remains our position that the army council must leave the stage and that the ira should no longer function in any respect
2966276 the final ending of the provisional army council pac may be difficult to call if three of them met to plan the way forward is this a pac meeting
2966277 they have not formally disbanded but they arent doing what they were set out to do and they arent a security threat
2966278 in a democratic society you clearly cannot have an army council it is for police and security services to deal with dissidents
2966279 the key thing about policing and justice the minute it is devolved is the powers it brings to the office of the first minister and the deputy first minister
2966280 you cant have in government a party with a paramilitary structure
2966281 the ira have clearly gone off the stage and have done so since 2005
2966282 but theres still attempts being made by some people to drag them back on and i think thats silly
2966283 i was fortunate to get a good run and i am especially delighted to win for trainer caroline hutchinson
2966284 hopefully this is a sign that the rest of the day will be as rewarding
2966285 im delighted to train my first success here in addition this is the first winner which ruby has ridden for me he did ride a second one day
2966286 this has been a momentous week as far as im concerned for i know have a total of four wins from six runners i won at wexford roscommon cork and now downpatrick while im pleased for rugby i have to be sympathetic towards my regular jockey andrew lynch who broke his jaw at ballinrobe a fortnight ago and it looks as though he will be out of action for some time
2966287 thats the first time that ruby has ridden a winner for our stable and im absolutely delighted
2966288 thats seven winners weve sent out from our new home and six winners this year
2966289 when i won the race last year i was delighted but now i am doubly so after scoring a repeat win
2966290 all being well i will run royal approval again at ballinrobe tomorrow
2966291 the rainfall was completely freakish it was of monsoon proportions even met eireann couldnt forecast the particular weather front coming in until sometime on saturday morning which was very late
2966292 people would be ringing up saying their houses are flooded and there was water on the roads people were trapped in cars and they needed to be rescued

2966309 facua espera una sanci n ejemplarizante por parte de las autoridades competentes y lamenta el desprecio de ryanair hacia los derechos de los usuarios y la legislaci n vigente

2966311 desde el momento en el que una compa a a rea emite el t tulo de transporte independiente de quien haya sido el intermediario existe una obligaci n contractual entre el transportista y el pasajero
2966312 facua duda si el motivo por el que la aerol nea ha cancelado las reservas a trav s de las agencias es que stas cometen irregularidades como asegura ryanair o que le est n suponiendo la p rdida de negocios como por ejemplo la contrataci n de seguros que aparecen preseleccionados al comprar billetes en su p gina web sin aclarar que son opcionales una pr ctica que motiv las denuncias de facua el pasado enero contra ryanair y otras ocho aerol neas y agencias

2966316 we think mike has a quick mind and this is a campaign where youve got to be agile youve got to be quick
2966317 im sure the mcconnell people have polled on lunsford and one of the things that has come back is that people get the impression that hes either egotistical or arrogant
2966318 so in that shot hes got his hip hitched and it looks like a guy whos saying
2966319 im not going to get into critiquing all the ads
2966320 thats what the democrats did in the 2006 election they just talked about change and a new direction and they didnt really say much about anything else
2966321 after the fighting in the city we found several bodies of citizens of the baltic states and ukraine later on i was informed that the bodies of several black men were found at the scene of a battle near school number 12
2966322 the town looks like stalingrad during ww2 with fallen trees power lines burnt georgian tanks all over the streets the dead bodies of georgian soldiers are lying everywhere
2966323 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
2966324 with its bellicose behavior the west is pushing iran towards nuclear weapons even if they dont want them now
2966325 we want television screens in the west to be showing not only russian tanks and texts saying russia is at war in south ossetia and with georgia but also to be showing the suffering of the ossetian people the murdered elderly people and children the destroyed towns of south ossetia and regional capital tskhinvali this would be an objective way of presenting the material
2966326 this statement is a lie just like georgian president mikheil saakashvilis statement on the impossibility of using military force in conflict zones
2966327 the georgian side has named some nearby populated areas and towns saying they are being bombed by the russian air force i take full responsibility in saying that the russian side did not bomb any populated area
2966328 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
2966329 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
2966330 georgia does not stop its treacherous actions on abkhazias border and continues to intensify its military presence the armed forces of the republic were forced to enter the security zone and advance towards the georgian border

2966395 i went over there for a year and it took me 11 years to get back
2966396 the difficult bit is in figuring out how youre not going to support what youre not going to support theres a lot of work thats gone into aligning the department to the pressure points of the business and driving efficiency with the way we work with our internal clients
2966397 the sales team has a business pipeline featuring all the deals it has a chance of closing this year
2966398 the legal file creates a subset of stuff that were likely to be working on each quarter work that we know is right has enough risk and is a priority for the business
2966399 were probably the only it provider that provides all flavours of hardware software and services in most countries to all segments in the market
2966400 its a big complex business with all sorts of opportunities for lawyers we couldnt possibly cover all of that so we have to be disciplined with our model and importantly give the business visibility into how much legal support it has and what were working on when were running out of capacity as we do towards the end of a quarter then we see it coming and the business guys see it coming too and we can manage around that
2966401 one of the things i look for is a firm that will actually enter into a fee arrangement with us that looks like a business case
2966402 well take an annual view with targets incentives and penalties in place to manage to that budget weve got that in place with shoosmiths and its working incredibly well
2966403 hes a good fella and it was out of character
2966404 more than 50 russian warplanes are flying over georgia tbilisi was bombed bombs hit the village of kojori and makhata mountain
2966405 there was heavy firing all night with rockets and machine guns from the southern side of the city
2966406 the situation is very tense here this is a humanitarian catastrophe there is no water and the citys entire infrastructure is destroyed
2966407 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia

2966410 from 30 june we have no longer been able to ship a pc with a xp licence
2966411 however what we have been able to do with microsoft is ship pcs with a vista business licence but with xp pre loaded that is still the majority of business computers we are selling today
2966412 looking into a crystal ball i dont think businesses will see much value in upgrading to vista until late next year and even so microsoft will probably have come out with something else by then
2966413 issues with the structure and scope of the new government are likely to take centre stage
2966414 with the death of darwish palestinian literature lost one of its pillars
2966415 la russia ha esteso la battaglia oggi ben oltre lossezia del sud attaccando il porto georgiano di poti e la citt di gori mentre le forze abkhaze hanno bombardato postazioni georgiane nellalta valle di kodori io deploro tutto questo
2966416 se la presidenza francese dovesse decidere di affiancare le forze di mosca che da anni su mandato internazionale presidiano lossezia del sud anche litalia mander le sue truppe
2966417 litalia ritiene che non si possa creare una coalizione europea anti russa e in questo siamo vicini a putin ma mosca aggiunge deve comprendere che il peacekeeping oggi affidato esclusivamente alle sue forze militari dovr essere discusso con la comunit internazionale
2966418 leuropa deve essere il ponte tra stati uniti e russia

2966420 could limit lipas ability to raise rates as costs rise
2966421 we remain concerned about the impact this legislation may have on our credit quality
2966422 he will review it and seek input from interested parties before making a decision
2966423 wall street has found a way to accept this for most all other public utilities
2966424 protests too much it really has me questioning what would be found if there was a thorough review done
2966425 absolutely im going to see what our competitors are up to
2966426 a moment to think about your life and put stuff in order
2966427 the bottom line is that a lot of people dont want to think of the what ifs but you have to
2966428 it could be one guy and one truck or a small fleet of five or 10 or 15 trucks
2966429 what were noticing right now which we feel is a trend is we are starting to see some machine tools
2966430 were not seeing a ton of them but weve gone from seeing none to some
2966431 the last time we saw a real upturn in them was after 9 11
2966432 the first quarter of 2008 brought to the auto finance industry a significant increase in delinquencies and repossessions especially among finance sources with higher risk portfolios
2966433 i hope we can consider and move on a decision at that time
2966434 what i learnt ten years ago is not even offered here in india
2966435 the opportunity cost for a student with masters degree to pursue a phd in economics is very high
2966436 electronic copies of the 87 slide presentation circulating the internet disparaged the transit systems physical security and showed photographs of unlocked doors turnstile control boxes and exposed computer monitors at subway stations one slide explains that the presentation would teach attendees how to generate fare cards reverse engineer magnetic stripes on cards and hack radio frequency identification rfid cards
2966437 it can really lower your advertising and lead generation expenses
2966438 you want to interact with the customers you dont want to be passive
2966439 choose a partner with the same demographics you are seeking
2966440 he went through about three quarters of the morning practice maybe a little bit more than that
2966441 we took him out because were easing him back in he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good
2966442 i dont know if it will be as much as the first group goes or if hell just take a few snaps but well see how he feels here
2966443 he needs to practice in this scheme but hell pick it up and be fine
2966444 i knew that the team wasnt going to be too happy with me not being involved in the optional workouts you can ask anyone around im the first one here and the last one to leave i love pushing myself working out and being here its just with some personal things going on i wasnt here
2966445 i know i just have to keep getting better every day and try to help this team
2966446 kimo has to get himself right and we can always bring him back if we need to later
2966447 this medal is good for georgia especially during times like this
2966448 i am very nervous today its very difficult for my people
2966449 its very difficult for us as georgians because of everything thats going on at home it was nice that natalia paderina came up to me after and gave me a handshake
2966450 this is an isolated incident that had nothing to do with anything other than what can happen in any big city around the world if it had been some other random tourist we wouldnt even know anything about it maybe
2966451 so of course she got on the plane anyway and ill be happy to have them here you know youve just got to live your life you cant live in fear or anger about what happened
2966452 bad things happen in fort wayne ind where were from every day but we still go to coney island downtown we still go get gas still go to wal mart thats how you kind of have to live your life
2966453 they have told us not to do anything like that
2966454 you know at the olympics it could be anything it could be because you guys want an interview it could be a problem with tickets or logistics or practices we didnt know not until we got our therapy done and whatnot and saw the usoc people show up and the head of usa volleyball we knew something was wrong
2966455 we had lots of questions being only a couple hours since the incident they didnt have a lot of answers thats where most of the frustration came in were trying to make decisions in the next six hours people are supposed to fly here should we tell them to come not come was it something related to usa athletes or usa volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know obviously it was
2966456 we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2966457 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2966458 you have to get focused and give it a go
2966459 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2966460 bonds is not a fit for us if he would come i would go i wouldnt want to deal with it
2966461 i think the guys are looking forward to it this season will be a new challenge for us
2966462 they laid a fastball in there and he hit it out
2966463 thats what happens if youve got patience i aint worried about chases hitting not at all his hitting is going to come around hes fine hes a good hitter
2966464 obviously i didnt want to hit into a double play but we swung the bats well late in the game thats really all that matters
2966465 weve all been in the batters box hundreds of times with guys on base and without guys on base
2966466 so you try not to let it change your approach
2966467 he still gets his walks when he gets a hit its usually a huge one i think thats the sign of a great hitter to be able to mask those slumps with his tenacity even if hes 0 for 20 having him in the lineup is a weapon
2966468 hes so steady so even keel he does a good job of not riding that roller coaster that a lot of us get wrapped up in thats why as great as he is a lot of us dont notice he may be in any kind of slump
2966469 he makes it look too easy at times hes a huge part of our success this year he prepares every day hes a good guy to have on your team
2966470 it will be nice to play some good ball weve been playing decent ball but i dont think weve peaked yet
2966471 were too good an offensive team to hit the way we have
2966472 all it takes is one pitch one swing one at bat to get going
2966473 that would have to be in the unbelievable category thats the biggest word i know
2966474 obviously losing the 200 breaststroke at trials it kind of affects your confidence a little bit
2966475 i felt good going into the race tonight obviously everybody brought their a game everybody swum really really really well its just a true testament to the job beijing has done allowing the athletes to perform at their peak its awesome thats what you want in an olympics and theyve done an amazing job as a host
2966476 it was in kind of broken english so he could understand me i just said congratulations man thats an awesome swim i know if id done that in front of him hed have done exactly the same thing youve got to tip your hat off to somebody who goes 58 9 in an olympic final its awesome
2966477 i dont want to be the center of attention now
2966478 its like a card game and a lot of people are showing their hands
2966479 i knew i wasnt at my sharpest i wasnt at my best
2966480 i saw the ball go by me off to the right
2966481 after i saw the ball go by i realized i could make it to second but when i turned to go to second base randy was right there i really had nowhere to go i just talked to him to see if he was ok and he said he was watching the ball as well so it was one of those things
2966482 but i dont want to keep plugging through it and make it worse were just giving it a couple days to let the inflammation out the doctors looked at it its no cause for alarm we just want to make sure we nip it in the bud
2966483 my shoulder was feeling sluggish a little before and after the all star game i dont know if it contributed
2966484 in the video game industry if you sell a million copies you throw a ticker tape parade
2966485 if youre selling five to six million copies of the same title every year youve just won the super bowl world series and stanley cup combined
2966486 people who want to play with their favorite quarterback or their favorite team
2966487 hard core players can do hundreds of hours of labbing playing all the different teams to find an edge
2966488 theres a crazy amount of dedication to finding out ways to win this game
2966489 then its a race to figure out the game the players change but mostly its what ea does with the game the new features
2966490 mostly practice and reaction time and getting everything down so you dont have to think about it while youre playing
2966491 randy moss has a big advantage over any defensive back
2966492 just throw the ball up and hell go get it
2966493 im very competitive and i like to match wits with other opponents
2966494 i love to talk trash thats the best part of the game for me
2966495 if youre playing a good defensive back like antonio cromartie why would the ball go through his hands and hit him in the face
2966496 ea does it because they dont want the backs to have outrageous interception stats but its really annoying
2966497 it should balance out between someone with twitch skills and someone who knows football strategy
2966498 i thought matt passed the test in terms of poise and execution
2966499 i thought for the first time in an nfl game he was very impressive
2966500 we wanted to get him in early to play against the best and i thought he handled it extremely well
2966501 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2966502 like i said plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress
2966503 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2966504 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everything is set up for him here so he can be successful
2966505 im going to gradually feed him back in i just want to see how hes doing thats my primary focus right now then well see about those other things well see where they fall in
2966506 he made it through this much of camp without a problem which he hasnt done in the past it has always happened sooner than this i guess im looking for a positive in the situation i expect him to get out and be ready to go here in the next little bit
2966507 enjoys starting at guard but if you asked him his choice hes going to tell you tackle
2966508 thats what he sees himself as hes doing a heck of a job right now at guard too hes having his best camp so far
2966509 with tra out there id rather play guard but if tra isnt out there id rather play tackle
2966510 i feel like its a little easier on your body and you get to use a little more of your athleticism at tackle instead of brute force i was a little rusty at it today
2966511 i think he could step in and be one of the better left tackles in this league he just hasnt had a chance to work there
2966512 ive been anxious ever since we got to camp to see shawn
2966513 the first cargo with humanitarian aid has arrived at its destination
2966514 a number of regions have proposed using their facilities to house and teach south ossetian young people
2966515 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
2966516 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
2966517 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
2966518 this employee was terminated for behavior that violated the firms code of conduct and policies
2966519 he seems to be an extremely well known person across the trading community and we thought it would be
2966520 behavior that violated the firms code of conduct and policies
2966521 the last time i had five dunks i was like 17 thats all because of the energy
2966522 the one thing about us were not used to seeing open looks
2966523 what did you do to have your players kill their super egos
2966524 well im going to tell them you think they have super egos
2966525 we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like what kind of slap in the face is this they are 12 14 years old and they get lined up and the government backs them and the federation runs away
2966526 there is an age limit and it cant be controlled
2966527 a fortune teller told me if i changed my name i would go far so i changed it because i wanted to go to the olympics
2966528 por un lado est n los pr stamos que se pueden llegar a negociar con las entidades bancarias llegando a nuevos acuerdos de plazos de pago pero con los proveedores no se puede negociar te plantean sus necesidades inmediatas
2966529 hay pendiente una reuni n con el gobierno de canarias para hablar de la deuda principalmente referida a los proveedores que resulta un agobio diario de llamadas que no podemos atender como es debido y son peque as empresas que se encuentran luchando en este momento de crisis
2966530 el certificado de estar al d a con la seguridad social y desde hace unos quince d as tambi n tenemos el certificado de estar al corriente de pagos con la administraci n de hacienda lo que supone que podemos plantear alg n proyecto para betancuria al poder acceder a subvenciones que son fundamentales en un municipio con muy pocos recursos
2966531 el 95 por ciento del territorio del municipio se incluye dentro de un parque rural sin un documento que lo regule se esta redactado un nuevo plan que espero que a fin de a o este aprobado definitivamente y a partir de ah poder poner en marcha proyectos tur sticos enfocados a una oferta convencional y especialmente al turismo rural apoyando a los propietarios de casas antiguas para que sean rehabilitadas
2966532 we shall name the opponent at the last minute to avoid changes but we are targeting a kenyan or a tanzanian
2966533 he is good but i now know exactly what to do when i play him
2966534 sunghwan is good in the air and net shots but i will try my best i have come here to compete nothing will scare me
2966535 i am confident of his abilities to take on the best in the world
2966536 its about patriotism in case he has no one to help i will offer myself so that he concentrates on the technical advise
2966537 its is not that easy man you have too many things to do and you cannot concentrate if you are alone
2966538 i know i have the slowest time but i have come to compete and i will do basically that i will not let my time tie me down
2966539 i know my time is not good enough for a medal but i am prepared to win my heat
2966540 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2966541 its the perfect time to make mistakes to get the nerves out we have our world title from last year and we feel like we are the world champions and we want to show the world that
2966542 i am totally surprised its some type of nerves i just have no explanation
2966543 both of us have hoped and prayed that when this day came we would be one and two
2966544 whether it was her first or me first it didnt matter going into the all around final its going to be great knowing that no matter what ill have my teammate right there and shell be helping me and ill be helping her
2966545 of course there will be pressure the only thing i can do is overcome it
2966546 i hope the pressure can become the motivation and that i can be very calm
2966547 it was not as relaxed and easy as it looks because we actually worked very hard every day training from morning until night
2966548 the last dive may not have been perfect but it was not a failure
2966549 but im sure china will come up with someone new
2966550 el presidente saakashvili ha aceptado pr cticamente todas las propuestas que le hemos hecho
2966551 ive said it before there were times i didnt know if i was going to be playing anymore i honestly didnt know
2966552 there were some scary times too those are all behind me now hopefully i came out of it feeling good and im just really really happy now
2966553 whether you are a believer or not no one is allowed to enter the church when president bush comes tomorrow where can we do our sunday service
2966554 president bush is coming to preach the gospel to those who dont believe in the lord referring to those police officers and officials we are already believers so we certainly dont have to come here tomorrow
2966555 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing china you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2966556 and i want to thank the pastor for his hospitality and i want to thank this beautiful choir for singing amazing grace and edelweiss it was a touching moment its been a joy to worship here again i want to thank you sir and god bless you god bless you

2966558 think about it if you know about a malicious piece of software that invades your privacy how irresponsible is it to let the application continue to run
2966559 either it is an anti malware solution and has a switch somewhere to vaporise any app or its not an anti malware solution and is really designed to kill applications that interfere with apples business model
2966560 we were very close to being in the quarterfinals and now we are very far
2966561 before the game nobody gave us a chance and i think we played pretty good you can look at this as half empty or half full
2966562 when i scored that goal we went and picked it up
2966563 when i came in they said they werent sure and so i said ill take it
2966564 you just blast it on goal and see where it lands
2966565 if you look at the replay it goes right under the wall
2966566 unfortunately we were the better team for 70 minutes we let two points get away from us
2966567 maybe its based on me canceling my appointment with her the other day

2966590 education is particularly important notably for women community based programmes and health services can reduce malnutrition usually without food distribution this has been seen in tanzania through the iringa and child health and development programmes during the and the community nutrition project in senegal in 1996
2966591 accelerating globalisation of food production trade and marketing threatens the food security of poor communities in africa
2966592 without greater attention to nutrition increased child mortality morbidity and impaired intellectual development are inevitable

2966602 im just proud of the effort my team put in tonight and actually all year long
2966603 obviously you want the money but we really wanted the bonus points because the big money comes in the championship series
2966604 a petty reason why novelists more and more try to keep a distance from journalists is that novelists are trying to write the truth and journalists are trying to write fiction
2966605 in the month of august 1827 i was hired by joseph smith jr to go to pennsylvania to move his wifes household furniture up to manchester where his wife then was
2966606 joseph wept and acknowledged he could not see in a stone now nor never could and that his former pretensions in that respect were all false he then promised to give up his old habits of digging for money and looking into stones
2966607 joseph told me on his return that he intended to keep the promise which he had made to his father in law
2966608 it will be hard for me for they will all oppose as they want me to look in the stone for them to dig money
2966609 emma wrote to me inquiring whether she could have her property consisting of clothing furniture cows amp c i replied that her property was safe and at her disposal in short time they returned bringing with them a peter ingersol l and subsequently came to the conclusion that they would move out and resided upon a place near my residence
2966610 smith stated to me that he had given up what he called
2966611 joseph secured the services of a neighbor peter ingersoll to assist and accompany him in acquiring emmas property in august 1827 eight months after their marriage joseph and emma returned with ingersol to face isaac ingersol reported that isaac exclaimed in a flood of tears you have stolen my daughter and married her i had much rather have followed her to her grave you spend your time digging for money pretend to see in a stone and thus try to deceive people
2966612 yet on that visit there was an attempt to reconcile joseph and his father in law for an invitation was extended to joseph and emma to make their home in harmony
2966613 smith stated to me he had given up what he called glass looking and that he expected and was willing to work hard for a living
2966614 you have need of many things in this world food clothing and shelter for your family and yourself the common comforts of life and the things that shall be conducive to refinement to development to righteous enjoyment
2966615 the things that shall be conducive to refinement to development to righteous enjoyment
2966616 you desire material possessions to use for the assistance of others
2966617 we feel that every member of the church should be entitled to make his own decision as to what he thinks he owes the lord and to make payment accordingly
2966618 reduced to the utmost penury so that she had nothing coming in
2966619 have you ever found a landlord on earth who was willing to make that kind of equitable contract with you
2966620 i feel in my heart that i could scarcely raise my countenance to heaven if i tried to defraud god out of that which is rightfully his
2966621 pay ten percent across the board regardless of your income
2966622 and after that those who have been thus tithed shall pay one tenth of all their interest annually and this shall be a standing law unto them forever for my holy priesthood saith the lord
2966623 verily i say unto you it shall come to pass that all those who gather unto the land of zion shall be tithed of their surplus properties and shall observe this law or they shall not be found worthy to abide among you
2966624 wherefore abram paid unto him tithes of all that he had of all the riches which he possessed which god had given him more than that which he had need
2966625 for your guidance in this matter please be advised that we have uniformly replied that the simplest statement we know of is that statement of the lord himself that the members of the church should pay one tenth of all their interest annually which is understood to mean income no one is justified in making any other statement than this we feel that every member of the church should be entitled to make his own decision as to what he thinks he owes the lord and to make payment accordingly
2966626 the simplest statement we know of is the statement of the lord himself namely that the members of the church should pay one tenth of all their interest annually which is understood to mean income no one is justified in making any other statement than this
2966627 one tenth of all their interest annually which is understood to mean income
2966628 one tenth of all their surplus properties annually which is understood to mean surplus income
2966629 the book of abraham translated from the papyrus by joseph smith a translation of some ancient records that have fallen into our hands from the catacombs of egypt the writings of abraham while he was in egypt called the book of abraham written by his own hand upon papyrus
2966630 let me give you the definition in brief your endowment is to receive all those ordinances in the house of the lord which are necessary for you after you have departed this life to enable you to walk back to the presence of the father passing the angels who stand as sentinels being enabled to give them the key words the signs and tokens pertaining to the holy priesthood and gain your eternal exaltation in spite of earth and hell
2966631 unfortunately there is no historical evidence to support a continuous functioning line from solomons temple to the present we know what went on in solomons temple its the ritualistic slaughter of animals
2966632 the message and the messenger latter day saints and freemasonry
2966633 masonry while claiming a root in antiquity can only be reliably traced to mediaeval stone tradesmen
2966634 it is clear that freemasonry and its traditions played a role in the development of the endowment ritual
2966635 an in depth study of this matter is being prepared
2966636 w lang whose law firm the excommunicated oliver cowdery joined wrote the plates were never translated and could not be and were never intended to be this suggests that cowdery still believed that there were actually plates
2966637 rigdon got the original at the job printing office in pittsburgh
2966638 apparently cowdery had admitted the hoax to lang but took all the credit for it
2966639 this is not consistent with cowdery being the servile follower of smith that he had been had cowdery given smith the completed manuscript furthermore losing the first 116 pages of the dictated translation would have scarcely been a problem cowdery despite his apparent boasting to lang can be considered a collaborator at best but a conspirator at least
2966640 dear sir your note of the 1st inst i found upon my desk when i returned home this evening and i hasten to answer once for all i desire to be strictly understood when i say to you that i cannot violate any confidence of a friend though he be dead
2966641 this i will say that mr cowdery never spoke of his connection with the mormons to anybody except to me we were intimate friends
2966642 the plates were never translated and could not be were never intended to be what is claimed to be a translation is the manuscript found worked over by c cowdery he was the best scholar amongst them rigdon got the original at the job printing office in pittsburgh as i have stated
2966643 i often expressed my objection to the frequent repetition of and it came to pass to mr cowdery and said that a true scholar ought to have avoided that which only provoked a gentle smile from c
2966644 without going into detail or disclosing a confided word i say to you that i do know as well as can now be known that c revised the manuscriptand smith and rigdon approved of it before it became the book of mormon i have no knowledge of what became of the original never heard c say as to that
2966645 how the heck did joseph smith put chiasmus writing styles in the bom
2966646 knowing that you know that you know you know its true
2966647 just make it to the philippines itll be awesome there
2966648 why is nephi preaching the doctrine of grace which wasnt used in pauls sermons until 600 years later
2966649 why is he telling specific details about a baptism that hasnt happened yet
2966650 wahoo we split their family and now they are in our religion yippie
2966651 i had struggles too and all my areas sucked until now
2966652 the church is true the church is true the church is true the church is true
2966653 im not sure but i think you may have depression lets call the doctor i have a few doctor friends

2966659 our in field representative is busy there was a hurricane blah blah blah
2966660 ill let you know how would you like to be a with a companion who is just on fire well go ask the lord if the bom is true
2966661 its a very serious process when a missionary decides to turn down a call from god but the wheels have started to turn do you love your new companion and area

2966676 at minimum ce interconnection standards should rely on a low cost widely adopted and universally implementable interface ethernet over rj45 being the obvious choice
2966677 the commission should urge ce manufacturers even as they implement the mou to take steps now to future proof their devices and ensure compatibility with video providers
2966678 this is essentially in order to ensure that the technological shift towards ip does not end before it reaches the television set
2966679 to make mandatory the availability of set top boxes using an ip based interface that facilitates home networking such as ethernet
2966680 we would like to believe in video platforms or internet protocols but we havent seen proof that they exist yet
2966681 the reason none of lost jockey has been released on cd is that it would have had to be re released and the group split up with no legal constructions to enable such releases
2966682 last year woky radio switched its format to 60s and 70s music they also began a weekly segment called throwback thursday that features milwaukees best remembered and loved sixties bands
2966683 host gregory jon invited me on to talk about the ricochettes gregory reported many milwaukee 60s bands were reforming the skunks el rey and the nightbeats big louie and the renegades etc he thought it would be a wonderful idea if the ricochettes reformed thus this reunion
2966684 cyo dances were the main meeting place for all milwaukee teens throughout the 60s
2966685 they became a proving ground as well for all milwaukees bands and the ricochettes played cyos from cudahy to menomonee falls and port washington to new berlin
2966686 we became regulars at george devines million dollar ballroom in the eagles club we also opened for many of the british invasion bands in milwaukees auditorium and arena and traveled to chicago to play the aerie crown theatre and opera house and auditorium
2966687 our greatest thrill was opening for the rolling stones at milwaukees auditorium
2966688 however our bragging rights are a tad moot as we have no proof it seems pictures were taken backstage of us and the stones celebrating my and jerry wollenziens birthdays by a milwaukee journal photographer however in our excitement no one bothered to get copies of the pictures
2966689 the new amalgamation continued to play successfully throughout the next several years
2966690 eventually life the army and vietnam marriage children and other musical pursuits intruded
2966691 the band still has an extensive roster of beatles tunes however other british invasion acts like the hollies tremolos fortunes etc have provided repertoire for the group
2966692 but ar kriegel and jim milewski have continued to hone their individual songwriting chops and the band will continue to perform several of their original tunes

2966696 twenty five years thousands of volunteers it is an extended family with everyone celebrating weddings births deaths irish fest is a team effort brought together by hard working friends many of whom have spent years as volunteers some sing low some sing high on the irish fest wire to paraphrase the old song but through it all there is a tight bond and all their efforts accomplished so much hey families have fun they laugh they cry they moan they goof around they celebrate
2966697 but probably the culmination of all that the fest means was when irish president mary mcaleese walked out on the stage in 2005 for her initial festival appearance storm clouds were roiling on the horizon it had rained a bit then on cue of course as the opening program was about to conclude a rainbow appeared over the lake applause hugs and general high fives ensued irish fest had made it
2966698 to ensure that there are replacements for the old guard youth development is an ongoing process at irish fest young people have been mentored and trained on the job both for the all important grunt duties as well as management there are numerous examples of second and now third generation families active at the festival this will ensure a strong corps of volunteers in the future that sort of spirit simply wont die out
2966699 lets hope that every milwaukee ethnic festival can stay strong because these events water our community roots youve got to know where you came from before you know where you are and where you are going regardless of ethnicity

2966742 my next post is going to be superb long interesting and everyone will start flocking back to my blog
2966743 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2966744 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2966745 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2966746 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2966747 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2966748 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2966749 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2966750 when there is no enemy within the enemies outside cannot hurt you
2966751 we really want to have someone here who can speak that language who can really relate to that community
2966752 i would like a handful but one would be a great start
2966753 brazilians are very warm people it is easy for us to get used to other backgrounds other cultures
2966754 the women see the telenovelas and the brazilian magazines and they want those styles they like to look good and theyre not afraid to spend money
2966755 with the shops and the restaurants it gives a little bounce
2966756 we want to participate and give something before we ask for anything
2966757 we want to change peoples ideas of what immigrants are like
2966758 if youre a victim of a crime your immigration status is not going to come into play
2966759 we are trying to overcome this lack of trust because it hurts the people
2966760 will be the best advertisement and there will quickly be more
2966761 i would hope to see a portuguese speaking officer in my time here

2966771 wir wollen versuchen dass in london 2012 nur noch u 23 spieler dabei sind und es keine ausnahmeregeln mit lteren spielern mehr gibt
2966772 meiner ansicht nach sollten wir das olympia turnier bei der heutigen qualit t der u 23 spieler als u 23 turnier belassen die abstellung dann aber zur pflicht machen und das gewohnheitsrecht durch einen entschluss ersetzen
2966773 das ist nicht m glich weil in diesem kalender nur die a l nderspiele oder die turniere der konf derationen oder die fifa turniere aufgef hrt sind

2966797 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2966798 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2966799 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2966800 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2966801 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2966802 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2966803 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids
2966804 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2966805 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2966806 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2966807 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2966808 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2966809 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2966810 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2966811 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2966812 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
2966813 isaac hayes was a wonderful human begin and his spirit will live long in the form of his music

2966817 acting on this really wonderful feedback give the students a show for themselves where they can just perform and show what they can create
2966818 so on sunday august 31 the students will actually perform
2966819 do i shine so brightly that people who meet you are hungry for what you have do i truly lift everyone up who comes into contact with me do i lift up the planet and all of life by the power of my words and thoughts
2966820 when i look into my dogs eyes and stroke her i think that my love for her is flowing through all dogs in the world and when i stroke my pigs stomach i think that this ease and light is flowing through all pigs in the world especially to the pigs at the slaughter houses including all people who work there or when i fill the trough for my horses with water i send light in this water and think that my light is flowing through all waters on the earth another thing is i bless the earth everyday when i walk with my dog through nature i bless the earth and give thanks with every step when my feet touch the earth i send blessings and thanks deep in the earth and a few weeks ago i suddenly felt that the earth began to give me thanks back now i touch the earth with my right foot and send my blessings and thanks and when i touch the earth with my left foot the earth sends me thanks and power it feels like a power circulation and a special connection with the earth
2966821 after a snowfall i walk through the fields with my dog and write in the fresh snow with my finger peace love wisdom freedom joy and i think when the sun is shining the snow water brings the energy from these words into the earth
2966822 the privacy act was introduced before the advent of supercomputers the internet mobile phones digital cameras e commerce sophisticated surveillance devices and social networking websites all of which challenges our capacity to safeguard our sensitive personal information
2966823 with this tool we are able to monitor individual transmission lines and place the system as a whole in the context of potential impact on population transportation and critical infrastructures
2966824 only be addressing these barriers will we get people to recycle more things more often
2966825 good communication about their councils recycling service is vital but it will not persuade people to use services which are unreliable or too complicated
2966826 companies want to build here because we have made the uk one of the most attractive places to invest in wind power by the end of 2009 a further 626 mw of offshore wind power will be plugged in to the grid making us world leaders

2966828 products that come into contact with food and beverages must undergo stringent safety testing and review prior to clearance for use
2966829 we are pleased to have health canada join the list of governmental agencies that have deemed this innovative product acceptable from a chemical safety standpoint for use in specified food contact applications
2966830 it is becoming increasingly apparent that we need a sea change in the way that many parents and their children fund university
2966831 one way to stave off the financial nightmares of the current university generation could be to start saving now
2966832 its great to see that todays teenagers are aware of the costs involved with going to university and are taking steps independently to try and avoid the high levels of debt that are now common amongst graduates
2966833 we would encourage parents and the wider family to consider saving as early as possible to help fund their childrens university aspirations mr white advised stumbleupon
2966834 one of the pictures is depicting movement is showing a man climbing a tree probably to go hunting a possum or something like that
2966835 the depiction of movement is quite rare in historic art around the world
2966836 thats what so important about it yes its important to culture yes its important aesthetically and for other reasons but from an international perspective its the greatest concentration of rock art in the world
2966837 no rock art was damaged or destroyed during this process and the relocated boulders are now indistinguishable from the surrounding landscape
2966838 youre removing a percentage of the rock art and therefore reducing the significance of it youve got to think of it as the aboriginal people think of it as a whole they see it as a place they dont see it as individual rock art
2966839 there has been no management for this archaeology to date
2966840 anywhere with this level of significance heritage of this significance you would have management in place in my opinion somewhere equivalent like stonehenge or kakadu all of those places have management in place
2966841 people take these rocks away if theres a small rock with an engraving on it people have been stealing them
2966842 western australia has one of the lowest population densities in the world we have oodles of land we have enormous stretches of coastal spinifex plains that are completely unoccupied
2966843 and what do we do we put the biggest industrial development in the country at the same site as the biggest cultural heritage site in the country its incredible
2966844 the only rock art the only petroglyphs that you are going to see 100 years from now are those very very deeply carved and they of course are a small minority
2966845 im very worried about it all my people are worried about it because its destroying all the aboriginal art
2966846 generations of people from the uttoxeter area have worked at foxs and it would be a tragedy if we were to lose the factory
2966847 if you were there you would have seen for yourself
2966848 didnt want to give me a reason to blame you eh
2966849 thats called loading right you have to listen to your own load and not let yourself get too heavy
2966850 i know and she knows shes just mad at herself and has to direct it somewhere else cheers thanks for stopping by
2966851 so the idea of pilates after loading comes flowing through a progressive pattern of movement no
2966852 why dont you do the side bending and ill support you
2966853 ive got something in mind that combines the two do you mind if i show you
2966854 let me repeat that back to you and see if i heard you right
2966855 could you guys do this somewhere else some of us have to pee
2966856 im blind in texas the lone star is hot tonight im blind in texas the cowboys have taken my eyes
2966857 i make so much less than that at my last job i was making about 20 000 per year and doing okay financially even though i wasnt so great emotionally now im even less than that i did the math and im only going to be making about 8500 per year even at 1 more per hour than im making now with a full 40 hours a week i will get barely 15000 a year and its not just gas prices going up everythings going up yeah theres a minimum wage increase but the increase in everything else is going to outstrip that quickly and taxes taxes on income taxes on food taxes on clothing taxes upon taxes upon taxes and theres nothing we can do about it oh we try with our votes but that does nothing we vote for who we think will serve us better when the plain truth is nobody in government gives a shit about any of us look at this
2966858 i am a bit surprised really but my logic would be that in the last 10 or 15 years we played in lots of divisions
2966859 and when we go to these grounds in the second third or fourth division then we bring an awful lot of supporters to away games and i think that this table is possibly a sign of resentment against us
2966860 plymouth have said that burnley is their most hated side and they are 300 miles away
2966861 that could be because we relegated them once on the last day of the season and then spoiled their glory days when we beat them in the play offs in another season
2966862 the same thing applies to stockport i think there is a little bit of jealousy there
2966863 we go to a lot of clubs now and there is no trouble never an ounce of bother
2966864 i find it quite amusing its just like the song no one likes us we dont care
2966865 ellos a la verdad para recibir una corona corruptible pero nosotros una incorruptible
2966866 the more people you stay with the more you learn about the world from their words
2966867 were talking about the death of a man its a big investigation
2966868 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all
2966869 he was a good guy he was far from being a gang member he was far from dangerous
2966870 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around 7 p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
2966871 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
2966872 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
2966873 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of noncombatants in the buildings at that time
2966874 all of a sudden this big gush of grey stuff came up and it ignited when it ignited it was like a tidal wave with fire
2966875 you could feel the heat coming at you it was amazing right out of a movie i couldnt believe it
2966876 ive got a really bad back i cant run when everyone started to turn around and run i thought oh great im going to get swallowed by a fire ball because i cant run
2966877 i just wanted to run as fast as i could
2966878 everything sounds okay why does it seem something is not right
2966879 no i get it listen to the sounds of the you hear it
2966880 no no i am not judging it i am only saying that the sound indicates
2966881 he is not visiting us hes stalking us why is he here i havent invited him for three weeks
2966882 i am a bit surprised really but my logic would be that in the last 10 or 15 years we played in lots of divisions
2966883 and when we go to these grounds in the second third or fourth division then we bring an awful lot of supporters to away games and i think that this table is possibly a sign of resentment against us

2966887 we go to a lot of clubs now and there is no trouble never an ounce of bother
2966888 i find it quite amusing its just like the song no one likes us we dont care
2966889 i am a bit surprised really but my logic would be that in the last 10 or 15 years we played in lots of divisions
2966890 and when we go to these grounds in the second third or fourth division then we bring an awful lot of supporters to away games and i think that this table is possibly a sign of resentment against us

2966902 i find it quite amusing its just like the song no one likes us we dont care
2966903 my problem is that you cant take no jokes loser
2966904 those who have had the honour of knowing master cpl roberts describe him as the embodiment of a brother in the truest sense of the world
2966905 truth honour and loyalty were not mere words to josh but the unspoken creed which he lived his life by
2966906 sadly the sun has set on the life of another true canadian son dear friend and soldier let us never forget his sacrifice
2966907 josh was a soldier he had always wanted to be a soldier and he loved what he did
2966908 he felt strongly in what he was doing and the family is hopeful canadians will understand and appreciate the sacrifice josh has made for all canadians and the sacrifice of all families of military personnel serving in afghanistan
2966909 hes the kind of guy we would describe as a soldiers soldier and i know thats a coined phrase but in actual fact he was one of those real guys
2966910 always carrying his share and more and always looking out for his buddies and comrades any which way quite often they may not have realized it but he was looking after them one way or another
2966911 you will see the food industry being supportive of government action
2966912 weve seen whats happened over the last eight years of government inaction
2966913 we have to allow this agency to mature into an effective 21st century agency to protect families
2966914 hell be in the nfl next year sekeres said of bowman who starred for the oklahoma state cowboys for the past two seasons

2966921 a conclusive cause of death will have to await further tests
2966922 sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well but its actually not the case
2966923 i played well hit some great winners got some good balls back i was playing very solid
2966924 i felt like i should have had today off but it was good practice
2966925 i wanted to go to the market today but we have to play so many matches
2966926 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium we just tried to ignore the times and race the final
2966927 i dont think either of us are natural sprinters we dont do the 100m free so we are naturally suited to the back half of the race
2966928 we didnt panic when we were a little bit behind i didnt see anyone past katie i didnt know what was going on
2966929 i couldnt see what there was on the other side of the pool i saw katie and just tried to catch her
2966930 i dont think either of us expected it and especially a gold and a bronze its absolutely amazing
2966931 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy
2966932 were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2966933 the wicket flattened out it was quite slow and took bounce out of the equation its still a very good wicket
2966934 we knew we didnt want them to get away from us its a very quick scoring ground at the oval with the square being so large but we didnt want ab de villiers to get away and the new ball comes a bit harder
2966935 we set defending fields with the aim of keeping them to a total of about 320 and thats what they got
2966936 we are pleased to have 10 wickets in hand going into the final day
2966937 this is a different win i was comfortable with my game in winning the open this week i havent been as confident and comfortable
2966938 here i hit some of the wildest golf shots ever hit on a golf course on friday but i knew i had the ability to win if i got a chance in the end it was a lot of sheer willpower that won it
2966939 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage you have to get focused and give it a go
2966940 if a couple of things had gone differently we would have been talking differently
2966941 it is hard to put an exact date on it but my recovery and rehab is going well so i hope to be back by december and there is no doubt in my mind i can come back just as strong and fast as before
2966942 now that i am out of the protective boot im working really hard with prav mathema my club physio to continue to strengthen my ankle through intensive rehab and training sessions as well as with margot wells to maintain my fitness
2966943 i work with margot to maintain my fitness levels and complement the work that i am doing to strengthen my ankle
2966944 we obviously didnt dive very well as you could probably tell it was disappointing but it was a great experience
2966945 i really enjoyed myself and had so much fun out there that is all you can ask for getting the experience of it
2966946 we prepared like a normal competition and we treated it like a normal competition it was just the fact it wasnt our day today we just had a bad day
2966947 we put 100 effort into every dive we did we just didnt pull it off
2966948 i played a very good week and today i played unbelievable
2966949 i dont think roddick was 100 but i played unbelievable to win i beat tommy robredo last year but to beat roddick in the united states i think is the best win of my career
2966950 marc crosas will be a star at celtic the kid has the quality to triumph abroad if he can succeed in lyon he can triumph in scotland
2966951 this season bar a have many players in midfield this was the obstacle for crosas but i believe that he will return to the club after a big year in celtic
2966952 this is a kid with a winners mentality and with a great control of the ball
2966953 i was frustrated at the beginning and you do think here we go again but all credit to my guys we got back to doing what we have been doing well and we controlled the ball well in the second half
2966954 ryan mcgoldrick has been doing a really good job for us but everyone contributed and thats what pleased me most
2966955 everyone knows that we can play footy but its a case of knowing when to do it and when to be conservative
2966956 we didnt even speak about the past it was just about us getting back on board with a win
2966957 we fell apart drastically and theres a lot of self examination thats got to be done by everyone at the club
2966958 its pointless blaming other people its now time for responsibility from everyone from myself down to the water carrier
2966959 our defence was atrocious and theres no doubt about that
2966960 ho scoperto che tutta linfelicit degli uomini deriva da una sola causa dal non saper starsene in pace in una camera
2966961 weve been here 30 years we expect to be here another 30 years
2966962 when youre here this long people know what you are and what youre about
2966963 everyone is really struggling financially and the idea that the supermarket will open with really high prices is not what people are looking for
2966964 my administration has been engaged with both sides of this trying to get a ceasefire
2966965 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
2966966 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are a crime of course primarily a crime against their own people
2966967 the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2966968 the vice president told president saakashvili that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2966969 i think the u s is the most powerful country in the world
2966970 i think the u s has lots of leverage and i think there are lots of diplomatic means that it could be done through
2966971 de todas formas nos parezca mejor o peor el papel que desempe la inquisici n est claro que la historia ha de servir entre otras cosas para aprender de ella y si bien es cierto que la inquisici n cometi errores tambi n lo es el hecho de que evit muchos males mayores

2966979 keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me and the god of peace will be with you
2966980 possible exception of cyprus in 1974 the council of europe has never had to tackle a situation where two member states were at war
2966981 the reasons cited by the russian authorities do not justify military action in the territory of georgia regardless of whether the action is taken in the province of south ossetia or in other parts of georgia
2966982 we have seen powers before claiming that the violations of the rights of holders of their passports or their nationality by a previous germany in eastern europe or a previous serbia in former yugoslavia justify them sending their armies into these countries

2967000 my point is a little more refined than that i am saying that islamic commercial banking is not islamic and this is because commercial banking is a combination of usury and misrepresentation the practice of usury is obvious and involves the advancing of money now in return for more money later while the misrepresentation is less obvious and involves the creation of money out of nothing most of the time the money that commercial banks lend is money that they themselves have created since neither usury nor misrepresentation can be islamised and since the business model of commercial banking requires both there cannot be such a thing as islamic commercial banking for the same reason there cannot be such a thing as an islamic central bank historically the muslim world has had neither commercial banks nor central banks though of course it did have institutions that fulfilled permissible functions such as payment transfer in our rush to create an islamic banking and finance industry we have forgotten to ensure that the money we are using is itself islamic islamic finance cannot be practiced with money that is un islamic we therefore need a very fundamental reform of the institutional framework in islamic banking and finance but unfortunately the industry is simply refusing to address the issue
2967001 globally the banking and finance sector is earning as much as two trillion dollars of gross profit a year a lot of this profit arises from the receipt and payment of interest within the financial system since islam is the only major ideology to challenge that practice in todays world the interest based institutions face two basic choices either they openly oppose the islamic banking and finance movement or they try to neutralise it from within i believe they have chosen to do the latter this helps to explain why critical issues are being swept under the carpet and why the core practices of islamic banking and finance are beginning to look indistinguishable from interest then there are the financial realities of life to contend with graduates in are more likely to choose to work for a major global financial institution on a starting salary of 60 000 pounds a year than with tarek el diwany for 10 000 pounds a year theyre not necessarily bad people but money talks and can often change a persons outlook on life this is one reason that the modern system of usury is so difficult to overturn too many of the worlds most influential people are earning a good living out of it so the issue remains that we need to reform the system and we cant rely on existing commercial forces to do that for us why would the dominant financial institutions of today want to change a system that has made them so profitable would institutions that depend upon interest for their continued success help to establish a paradigm that aims for the abolition of interest
2967002 many people and a few institutions are beginning to listen and campaign for financial reform in various ways these include the members of other religions for example the christian council for monetary justice in which has been campaigning for four decades against usury and the creation of money by the banking system one also occasionally finds mainstream politicians supporting some key policies of monetary reform american congressman dennis kucinich has argued for the adoption of interest free finance in public projects and the former prime minister of mahathir mohammed has promoted the use of gold in international monetary transactions vincent cable the liberal democrat shadow chancellor in the has argued for controlling inflation by raising bank reserve ratios instead of raising interest rates all of these are policies that i have argued for
2967003 naturally the scholars who are promoting the current version of islamic banking and finance wont agree with what im saying how could they i think that much of what they are doing is a gigantic mistake but i dont say that they are bad muslims one must presume that they are sincere in their thinking and everyone is entitled to his own opinion of course if we could only discuss our opinions on a level playing field we might start to make some progress in this industry unfortunately what has happened is that a rather narrow set of opinions from a small group of scholars has been used to define the nature of modern islamic banking and finance when in many cases there is little or no consensus to support those views some of the scholars that i work with and many of the bankers and lawyers say that the islamic banking game is a scam
2967004 two basic types of contract that can be used in trade and finance are contracts of investment and contracts of exchange the current islamic banking industry has based almost all of its products on contracts of exchange such as sale on a deferred payment basis or the leasing of some kind of asset these contracts are not controversial on their own though their purpose is easily distorted when several of them are combined into a single transaction for example i might buy some metal from an islamic bank for one hundred and ten pounds payable next year and then sell it to someone else for one hundred pounds payable in cash now if the bank organises these two transactions for me then i am effectively borrowing cash at 10 interest through the detailed contractual documents for some of these products makes one wonder what connection they have with all the lofty talk of risk sharing that one hears on the conference circuit in the event of a big recession well quickly see that the financiers are sharing little or no risk in most of these deals the bottom line is that contracts of exchange are intended for use by traders of goods and services not by banks if a bank wishes to trade cars let it become a car dealer if it wishes to rent property let it become a landlord and if it wishes to lend money for a profit let it not use the word islamic to describe the process
2967005 of the two main contract types it is the contract of investment that is the more suitable basis for funding businesses in islam since it involves a sharing of risks and rewards that cannot be achieved with a contract of exchange profit sharing securities issued by individual companies or funds comprising such securities are much more in line with the principles of risk sharing that islamic commercial law proposes this is the kind of product that islamic investment managers should develop and build upon there is a whole world of genuinely islamic products to develop if we stick to our principles here why not develop revenue sharing securities or true property partnerships between investors and developers why not launch an islamic education fund to develop muslim schools and colleges in the private sector there is so much we can do if we have some vision and confidence in ourselves the alternative is that we continue to copy the methodologies and product ranges of interest based finance and that will lead us nowhere in the long run
2967006 we develop financial products that avoid controversial legal techniques and that promote the core principles of islam

2967030 when you play a team like the all blacks you need to consider victors big strengths and how theyd be compromised if he doesnt have the right guy next to him
2967031 he is precisely the world class player he is because of the very foil bakkies provides for him believe me ive watched bakkies own climb to fame very closely because he plays the sort of tighter game i did towards the tail end of my career
2967032 victor brings exceptional skills to the lineouts and kick offs and his general athleticism is wonderful too but he is not such a huge presence at the contact point and thats where botha thrives you can see by his smile just how much he relishes hitting the rucks and doing the dirtier work
2967033 its true that andries bekker is a great prospect but he is much more in the matfield mould and that similarity would negate victors own strengths in a match like saturdays im pretty adamant about that
2967034 look danie is a big unit and a fine player going forward
2967035 its been an interesting few years for omnicare and this latest acquisition gives us an outstanding opportunity to continue to grow

2967038 everyone believes that we live in a consolidated city government but its not as consolidated as you think there are lots of redundancies and lots of services that happen all over the place that if we consolidated them then maybe we would receive some savings so this budget will also outline some of those things as well

2967047 i definitely want to do a duet its just about finding the right thing and the right time i miss singing so i am planning to do some more next year i did a duet with kylie on her tour last year we sang kids which was amazing
2967048 every time we watch it back we fall about laughing especially when we are swinging each other around because we used to do that on roller skates when we were young
2967049 to us thats us as kids and as sisters minus everything else it was nice to share that people think i dont like talking about kylie but that couldnt be further from the truth i understand why people ask about her
2967050 she is incredibly famous and loved by everyone so people want to know what it is like being her sister thats normal we are really different people so there has never been any competition
2967051 i would for the right man i curse my parents though i say to them its your fault im single they gave us such a great childhood my mother stayed at home while my dad went to work and i have such high hopes to recreate that
2967052 i told him that i dont sleep around but he kept insisting on having sex with me he later loosened his belt and unzipped his trousers to expose his private parts
2967053 on screen they light your body for hours so that you dont see every lump and bump and they spray your butt so it looks really nice but it doesnt look like that in reality you dont see all the stretch marks on film
2967054 i feel like i am fine with who i am and im fine with cellulite and i know its normal im not under any delusions of perfection and i dont feel glamorous at all
2967055 itll be interesting to see how he does its been quite quiet for him he had a after the final last year but i dont think its reasonable to expect to find a lewis 2006s winner every year thats too big an ask

2967073 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america

2967223 despite the current economic downturn the digital media sector is in a very healthy state and looks set to enjoy sustained growth over the coming years
2967224 because so many new companies chose to join the digital hub and because a number of our existing tenant companies expanded considerably in size we were presented with challenges in relation to providing the type of flexible office space and working conditions essential in the digital media sector
2967225 in addition to reaching 100 companies earlier this year another important milestone for the hub was achieved last week when the appeals to two revised planning applications under review by an bord plean la were withdrawn
2967226 this means the development of a significant amount of office and community space can now proceed and we can guarantee our companies that we will be able to continue to meet their needs as their businesses expand
2967227 it is quite clear that the board is under resourced and works under considerable pressures itself
2967228 however this situation means that the work of important publicly funded projects can be hugely held up if a set timeframe existed whereby the board was obliged to revert to developers with its planning appeals decisions within a specified time it would greatly assist state agencies public projects and all concerned in making alternative arrangements or re visiting planning applications to find new ways of meeting project needs
2967229 significant developments in relation to foreign direct investment occurred at the hub during 2007 with the addition of gala networks europe and goa games services a division of france telecom to the enterprise cluster
2967230 irish companies also enjoyed continued success including zamano which expanded its operations through the acquisition of red circle technologies
2967231 the employees in hub companies are very highly skilled and the companies typically operate in a flexible manner allowing them to quickly respond to changing market needs at any given time there are currently 750 high value knowledge employees working in the digital hub and i am confident this number will continue to rise over the coming years
2967232 i was positioned in the second tier of the stand in the front row on the opposite side to the main stand
2967233 i didnt see the rehearsal but i was aware that the torch bearer would run around the top of the stadium before finally lighting the olympic flame i had no idea how it was going to look but it turned out well from my position
2967234 a lot of luck is needed if li ning had lit the flame in a different spot i would have missed it completely i chose a long lens for this section of the ceremony and it paid off the projection of colour that followed the flame around the stadium really made this picture
2967235 i shot all aspects of the ceremony from the drummers at the start to the fireworks at the end and of course the teams entering the stadium
2967236 fireworks always make for great pictures but looking back at the ceremony the lighting of the flame was the highlight four years on from athens and the olympic torch finally reached its destination at the beijing olympic games

2967289 ive run it back in my mind so many times i came so close in the previous two rounds i had got up the travelator at the first attempt without stopping to compose myself beforehand
2967290 i saw joel had stopped to wipe his feet dry and rest for a second at the bottom of the travelator so i just went for it
2967291 even though my quad muscles were getting tight and felt like they were burning i was confident i would get to the top but i felt my feet slip about halfway up and there was no recovering it
2967292 that made it worse for me because by the next day the adrenaline had worn off and my legs felt heavy when you are winning you dont realise how physically tired you are but when i slipped down the travelator and saw joel reaching the top it really hit home
2967293 ian wright was always up for a bit of banter
2967294 we wanted to find a cycling trail that was fun and exhilarating for the riders i think weve found the perfect one in the follow the dog trail at cannock chase we will be branding the trail over the next couple of months with some creative and hopefully inspiring ideas we are also planning to stage some of the largest giant dirt demonstration weekends we have ever put on in the uk as well as a charity led giant bike ride
2967295 there are no facilities of this type scale or quality within an hours drive of the birches valley forest centre and so cannock chase is fast becoming established as the regions premier mountain biking venue the generous support from giant will allow the development of new purpose built trails which will encourage everyone from families and beginners to enthusiasts and experts to get more physically active
2967296 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction

2967370 but i dont remember why it the original media coverage on the justification for the us war in iraq wasnt questioned enough or how much it wasnt questioned because i wasnt here so im a little uncomfortable talking about that except to say that we would ask all of our reporters to dig as deep as they possibly can and take nothing for granted

2967373 medhas suffering preceded her narmada career she did not suffer because anti dam activism required suffering she suffered first then found a meaningful expression for it in the valley suffering became her fuel and her power and her validation the proof of her commitment to the cause and the source of her magnetism
2967374 the state level is where all the truly positive environmental action has been happening in recent years
2967375 governors occupy the executive branch which means they can push for positive environmental change whether theyve got a favorable legislature or not
2967376 we decided that since the best policies are being made at the state level thats where we should be doing our politics as well
2967377 essentially leadership at the state level is via industry calling washington to action
2967378 george bush is hands down the worst president on environmental and energy issues that this country has ever seen
2967379 its just a question of how many times a day
2967380 todays senate campaigns function as collection agencies for broadcasters you simply transfer money from contributors to television stations
2967381 the public owns the airwaves and licenses them to broadcasters broadcasters pay nothing for their use of this scarce and very valuable public resource their only payment is a promise to serve the public interest a promise that often goes unfulfilled
2967382 for 12 years the leadership in the house of representatives has stifled all discussion and debate of global warming
2967383 that long rejection of reality is over scientific evidence suggests that to prevent the most severe effects of global warming we will need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions roughly in half from todays levels by 2050
2967384 to reduce our nations dependency on foreign oil by investing in clean renewable and alternative energy resources promoting new emerging energy technologies developing greater efficiency and creating a strategic energy efficiency and renewables reserve to invest in alternative energy and for other purposes
2967385 this legislation eliminates 14 billion in giveaways to oil companies already making record profits and starts investing in clean renewable energy and energy efficiency the inclusion of the clean energy act of 2007 as part of the first 100 hours agenda sends a clear signal that the new congress is serious about creating real changes in our nations energy policy by saying no to big oil and yes to renewable energy our country is taking a significant first step toward a clean energy future
2967386 the main issue is that you have to give carbon a value and once its got a market value then people can trade it
2967387 the chronic crisis of low farm prices and high production costs during the 1980s forced off the land 24 of the rural population in the usa nebraska lost one third of its rural population since 1945 the united states has eliminated 4 million farmers land loss among blacks in the south continues at a rate of two and one half times greater than the national average at one time there were 926 000 african american farmers all of our black farmers may be gone by the year 2000 if we continue to allow this elite group of economic giants to dominate the farm and food sector we are poised to dump two billion of the 3 1 billion people who still live in the rural areas of the world into the cities there unemployment and other social political and environmental problems await them the forces rapidly pushing the world towards industrialization of agriculture are the same forces dominating u s farm and food production
2967388 if i were them democrats id be scared to death about novembers elections
2967389 you think the republicans are sure to lose big in november they arent heres why things dont look so bad to them
2967390 as long as they republicans end up keeping control of both houses they still come out the winner on election day
2967391 house republican officials contend that many of their democratic challengers are so little known that they could be buried in an ad blitz
2967392 why some top republicans think they may still have the last laugh upset in michigan
2967393 the war is going fine stand behind your fuhrer dont believe the stories you hear coming from the front
2967394 we have become a nation ruled by fear since the end of the second world war various political leaders have fostered fear in the american people fear of communism fear of terrorism fear of immigrants fear of people based on race and religion fear of gays and lesbians in love who just want to get married and fear of people who are somehow different it is fear that allows political leaders to manipulate us all and distort our national priorities
2967395 we are indeed a great nation one that has made significant contributions to humanity but our leaders are promoting delusional thinking when boasting that the united states and americans are superior to the rest of the human race we are no better and no worse
2967396 the major problems we face are all global in nature energy the environment terrorism drugs war immigration disease economic and cultural globalization these problems require global solutions that can only be addressed by concerted diplomacy and cooperation not jingoism about americas super power superiority
2967397 you can state categorically that any enterprise now supersized is likely to fail everything from the federal government to big corporations to huge institutions

2967428 most vermonters are looking for cleaner healthier and cheaper solutions to meet their heating needs coal is not one of those
2967429 our job is to keep vermonters warm in the most affordable responsible way we can and coal is not a solution
2967430 it is commendable to seek creative solutions to the heating problems that many vermonters will be faced with this winter
2967431 unfortunately this particular solution is problematic in its ability to be implemented and could have significant adverse impacts on the electric system it is not likely to be a useful option for this winter and as energy prices rise including electricity it is also not likely to be a good option in the long term

2967442 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2967443 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2967444 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2967445 der freiflug war ein fehler ich habe daraus sofort meine konsequenzen gezogen ich werde nie mehr einen freiflug nehmen
2967446 eine obergrenze die ich mir selbst gesetzt und eisern eingehalten habe
2967447 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2967448 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2967449 est consternado por el desproporcionado uso de la fuerza por parte de rusia y la falta del respeto por la integridad territorial de georgia
2967450 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2967455 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2967456 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2967489 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2967490 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2967491 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2967492 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2967493 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2967494 im not going to lie but when i flipped and saw how far ahead bernard was and hes the world record holder the thought caught my mind for a split second of theres no way but i changed that and said this is ridiculous this is the olympics im here for the united states of america and i dont care how bad it hurts so i got supercharged and took it from there
2967495 when you put a world record holder in the end of a relay and go in behind them the chance of you beating them is slim to none
2967496 theres no such thing youd better ask those who say hes going to resign
2967497 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of noncombatants in the buildings at that time
2967498 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan

2967505 my deepest sympathy to your family and friends how to put it in words i dont think i can
2967506 you are an aspiring booze intellectual and a social drinker you are curious and want to know more about the booze you enjoy
2967507 there is still a lot to experience and experiment but you are a quick learner and can soon become an alcoholic elite

2967512 it has been a very difficult time we are all deeply shocked and at the moment we are struggling to take it all in
2967513 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions the wind at the time was a south westerly force 5 7 with a moderate to rough sea state generating a heavy surf
2967514 members of the public entering the sea in these sort of conditions were putting themselves at severe risk no matter how commendable were their intentions
2967515 nu travers m frontiera de facto acesta este principiul nostru de baz

2967517 i was running and kept touching my head legs and arms to make sure i wasnt hurt because i couldnt believe i wasnt hit
2967518 i really didnt know what to expect to get a medal a the olympics im overwhelmed
2967519 now can we proceed with the extradition and the serious charges of kidnapping and rape
2967520 it will be nice to play some good ball weve been playing decent ball but i dont think weve peaked yet
2967521 were too good an offensive team to hit the way we have
2967522 all it takes is one pitch one swing one at bat to get going
2967523 i want to speak to you today regarding the miserable condition to which pakistan has deteriorated
2967524 let there be no doubt in your minds that dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destablise this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2967525 you know what i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2967526 but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2967527 yeah he wants to come back im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back up here with the guys
2967528 quite a few of the players know the situation and have been in communication with andrews
2967529 hes got some guys here that really care about him
2967530 if you want to lose your money bet on sonny
2967531 i had the referee check the gloves and it wasnt the gloves and some people say it might have been the alcohol they were rubbing on listons shoulders but it wasnt that
2967532 what it was was the monsels solution the cut man joe polino used its very caustic it burns the tissues it closes the cut turns the area black its banned now
2967533 i stuck my pinkie in my fighters eye stuck it in my eye and it burned like hell thats what it was
2967534 the kid wanted to talk to the ref because he felt something bad was going on but i didnt want that so i grabbed him by the wrists and stood him up before the 10 second buzzer and i told him to run
2967535 to never get involved with a fighters personal life or his religion had a fighter once he was complaining about his wife and i said thats women he went back told her angelo sided with him and that was that he split with his wife split with me
2967536 and then i took willie pastrano to fight chick calder in scotland we look it up we go to a catholic church to pray he gets his picture taken with a catholic priest theres no way we get a decision unless ive got a gun that was protestant territory
2967537 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2967538 never offered never considered no one even thought about it no one even mentioned it
2967539 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2967540 i talked to my wife for an hour yesterday because they had not left the states yet to come here
2967541 we talked about whether they should come or not shes a lot stronger than i am so she got on the plane anyway with the kids and ill be happy to have them here because you just have to live your life you cant live in fear or anger about what happened
2967542 this is an isolated incident that had nothing to do with anything other than what can happen in any big city around the world if it had been some other random tourist we wouldnt even know anything about it maybe
2967543 so of course she got on the plane anyway and ill be happy to have them here you know youve just got to live your life you cant live in fear or anger about what happened
2967544 bad things happen in fort wayne ind where were from every day but we still go to coney island downtown we still go get gas still go to wal mart thats how you kind of have to live your life
2967545 they have told us not to do anything like that
2967546 you know at the olympics it could be anything it could be because you guys want an interview it could be a problem with tickets or logistics or practices we didnt know not until we got our therapy done and whatnot and saw the usoc people show up and the head of usa volleyball we knew something was wrong
2967547 we had lots of questions being only a couple hours since the incident they didnt have a lot of answers thats where most of the frustration came in were trying to make decisions in the next six hours people are supposed to fly here should we tell them to come not come was it something related to usa athletes or usa volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know obviously it was
2967548 we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2967549 his call what the bleep am i supposed to do
2967550 two kind of i guess strong willed people that had a disagreement
2967551 i told him well go in my office and close the door he showed me up on the field and thats not done
2967552 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2967553 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2967554 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2967555 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2967556 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2967557 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2967558 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2967559 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2967560 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2967561 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2967562 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2967563 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2967564 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2967565 mr fawoles actions were serious and blatant and he poses an immediate risk to lenders
2967566 we have banned a number of mortgage brokers and others this year in connection with mortgage fraud and we will continue to make examples of people who commit mortgage fraud until behaviour changes

2967603 the taliban uses innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
2967604 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
2967605 we need to be cautious we need to keep our recurring basic pay low and reward workers well through variables by keeping our basic costs low we maintain our competitiveness
2967606 overall i should say employers will continue recruiting according to their needs but they will be much more conscious about the productivity of the existing employees
2967607 for the longer term they would have a wait and see mode wanting to understand better the impact of the us crisis and the european turmoil on the singapore economy
2967608 companies continue to churn in order to stay ahead and be competitive that type of restructuring retrenchment is expected to continue but the figures are not very big
2967609 we have heard stories and comments from hr of companies that new grads salary expectations remain fairly high because they have seen the data released by the universities last year
2967610 the gulf kingdom could buy up to 72 more of the multi role aircraft an adviser to the saudi government confirmed last night sunday
2967611 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
2967612 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
2967613 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
2967614 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
2967615 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
2967616 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
2967617 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
2967618 this is stuff you see other people do and you think thatd be awesome
2967619 i was an extra in the surrogates with bruce willis
2967620 i was in the background in a beauty shop scene
2967621 president obama and a democratic congress will likely dole out entitlements like free health care child care and cash payments to anyone who falls under a certain income level that means that people who drink gin all day long will be getting some of my hard earned money folks who dropped out of school who are too lazy to hold a job and who smoke reefer 24 7 will all get some goodies in the mail from uncle barack and aunt nancy
2967622 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
2967623 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
2967624 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
2967625 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
2967626 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
2967627 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
2967628 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
2967629 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
2967630 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
2967631 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2967632 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2967633 this is a truly great leader a truly great man a truly inspiring man
2967634 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
2967635 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2967636 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2967637 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2967638 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2967639 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2967640 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2967641 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2967642 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2967643 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2967644 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2967645 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2967646 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2967647 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2967648 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2967649 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2967650 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
2967651 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
2967652 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2967653 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2967654 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2967655 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2967656 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2967657 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2967658 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2967659 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2967660 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2967661 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
2967662 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
2967663 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
2967664 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
2967665 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
2967666 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2967667 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2967668 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
2967669 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2967670 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2967671 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2967672 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2967673 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2967674 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2967675 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2967676 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2967677 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2967678 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2967679 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2967680 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
2967681 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2967682 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2967683 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2967684 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2967685 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2967686 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2967687 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2967688 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2967689 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2967690 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2967691 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2967692 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
2967693 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
2967694 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2967695 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2967696 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2967697 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2967698 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2967699 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2967700 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2967701 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2967702 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2967703 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2967704 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2967705 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2967706 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2967707 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2967708 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2967709 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2967710 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2967711 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2967712 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2967713 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2967714 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2967715 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2967716 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2967717 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
2967718 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
2967719 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
2967720 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
2967721 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
2967722 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
2967723 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
2967724 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
2967725 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
2967726 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
2967727 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
2967728 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
2967729 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
2967730 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
2967731 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
2967732 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
2967733 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
2967734 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
2967735 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
2967736 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
2967737 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
2967738 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
2967739 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
2967740 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
2967741 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2967742 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2967743 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2967744 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2967745 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2967746 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2967747 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2967748 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2967749 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2967750 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2967751 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2967752 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2967753 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2967754 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2967755 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2967756 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2967757 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2967758 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2967759 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2967760 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2967761 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2967762 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2967763 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2967764 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2967765 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2967766 family members believe it is a medical condition that might have led to his death mr hayes was being treated for a number of medical issues
2967767 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2967768 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2967769 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2967770 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2967771 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2967772 just so you all know we did set a record
2967773 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2967774 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2967775 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2967776 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2967777 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2967778 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2967779 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2967780 even if he makes a marginal improvement with that huge group of voters that could ultimately be very important in certain swing states like my state of virginia where evangelicals comprise a large portion of the voters
2967781 many will either sit on their hands on election day or even if they vote for mccain they wont be out there mobilizing the base and doing the hard work that these folks have done in the past for the republican party
2967782 there are some data that young evangelicals are focusing on a variety of issues not just the social issues but i dont see a voting shift taking place just because younger folks care about the environment doesnt mean thats going to trump their concerns about the life issues
2967783 thats the minimal step he has to take to reduce the animosity against him on abortion
2967784 and if he doesnt do even that hes basically kissing goodbye the chances of making deep inroads in the white evangelical vote
2967785 he has got to come out forcibly and talk about reducing abortions in america he has to forcibly come out and talk about education and abstinence programs
2967786 we evangelicals have to face the fact that when we speak on this issue we in the church do not have enough authority to convince people of that position and have to resort to the coercion of the law
2967787 we have lost our moral authority in this society we havent been able to impact our own community to the extent that we should
2967788 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2967789 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2967790 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2967791 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2967792 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2967793 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2967794 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2967795 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2967796 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2967797 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2967798 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2967799 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2967800 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2967801 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2967802 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2967803 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2967804 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2967805 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2967806 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2967807 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2967808 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2967809 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2967810 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2967811 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2967812 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2967813 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2967814 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2967815 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2967816 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2967817 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2967818 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2967819 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
2967820 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2967821 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2967822 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2967823 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2967824 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2967825 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2967826 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2967827 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2967828 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2967829 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2967830 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2967831 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2967832 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2967833 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2967834 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2967835 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2967836 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2967837 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2967838 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2967839 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2967840 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2967841 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2967842 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2967843 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2967844 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2967845 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2967846 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2967847 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
2967848 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
2967849 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
2967850 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2967851 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2967852 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
2967853 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2967854 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2967855 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2967856 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2967857 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2967858 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2967859 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2967860 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2967861 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2967862 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2967863 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2967864 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2967865 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2967866 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2967867 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2967868 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2967869 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2967870 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2967871 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2967872 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2967873 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2967874 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2967875 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2967876 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2967877 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2967878 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2967879 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2967880 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2967881 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2967882 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2967883 would only have led to a toughening of the chinese position
2967884 stunning contrast between the sumptuous celebrations and the splendour of the olympics and the terror that continues to reign across historic tibet
2967885 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2967886 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2967887 theres something about a charismatic leader rallying huge crowds of germans in a large public square
2967888 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2967889 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2967890 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2967891 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2967892 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2967893 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2967894 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2967895 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2967896 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2967897 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2967898 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2967899 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2967900 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2967901 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2967902 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2967903 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2967904 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
2967905 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
2967906 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
2967907 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
2967908 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
2967909 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2967910 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2967911 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2967912 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
2967913 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2967914 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2967915 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2967916 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2967917 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2967918 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2967919 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2967920 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
2967921 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2967922 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2967923 its personal with him in terms of his own legacy and the race stuff really left a bad taste in his mouth
2967924 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2967925 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2967926 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2967927 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2967928 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2967929 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2967930 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2967931 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2967932 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2967933 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2967934 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2967935 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2967936 i have always had a reputation of delivering on the newsstand
2967937 its dead right now im not bringing out another issue ill just close it up
2967938 irrespective of what you may have done in the past in relation to the georgian state
2967939 are shooting at us from civilian facilities from schools and hospitals in order to try to describe the damage caused during the retaliatory fire as barbaric acts by the georgian side
2967940 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2967941 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2967942 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2967943 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2967944 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2967945 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2967946 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2967947 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2967948 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2967949 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2967950 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2967951 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

2967962 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
2967963 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
2967964 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2967965 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2967966 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
2967967 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
2967968 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
2967969 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2967970 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2967971 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2967972 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2967973 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high

2967986 the partnership with ibra we have to work a lot more but i like pairing up with him and creating spaces with certain movements
2967987 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2967988 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand

2968013 my hamstring is 100 percent now it took about four weeks for it to get fully recovered
2968014 ive basically been getting rehab on it and doing some light training in the process
2968015 id rather be a 100 percent coming into the olympics than risk being 85 percent going to a meet just to see where im at
2968016 i had a few chances in practice to see where im at and that kind of gave me a confidence booster

2968030 local and regional volleyball news stories from around the world
2968031 this game was pretty difficult from the beginning we are very happy with this victory because its not easy to win the first match of the olympic games in the first set we made many net violations so we just tried little by little to make fewer errors
2968032 the first match of the olympic games is always difficult for any team in the first set we made many errors like the captain said we made errors in our attacks and blocking and service reception it took a lot of effort to block such high attacks from poland but we were very lucky to win the game in the end
2968033 this is not the first time for me performing in the olympics but in front of such a large cheering crowd we were very excited of course we still have some pressure on our shoulders but because of the home crowd our motivation is strong
2968034 this was our first match at the games weve been preparing for four years now the day we have been waiting for has finally come so were excited we had a good performance but we also made some errors and we hope to improve upon those in the future
2968035 we had a very difficult situation i told the players to concentrate on the game the game always goes on we have to be strong and make sure we play our game and play for the usa we were lucky because there were many supporters behind us we would like to thank them for that
2968036 i think that we played a very good match because we played with good rhythm the experience of the fivb world grand prix has been very important for us we played we won we lost we have a good rhythm in play im very proud of my players because theyve been able to play a very good match with a completely new formation its important to start the olympic games with an important victory
2968037 at the beginning our coordination was poor and then we improved and played better and better in the third set our concentration was really poor and we lost that set by the fourth set we started to improve at the end the most important thing is that we won this game
2968038 im very happy because my team played in a balanced fashion we were able to maintain good focus on attack and counter attack it was very important for us to start the tournament
2968039 it will be difficult to play russia we have equilibrium with eight teams here it was important for us to start well the next one russia is strongest and then serbia then kazakhstan and then italy every team here is very strong we will focus on the next game every time

2968044 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
2968045 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
2968046 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
2968047 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
2968048 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
2968049 one of the obvious high priorities in my talks with president hugo chavez would be the fermentation of anti american sentiment in latin america
2968050 to avoid being mistaken for a sellout i chose my friends carefully the more politically active black students t he marxist professors and structural feminists
2968051 a close look at john mccains senate voting record on judicial confirmations makes it painfully clear that progressives need to ignore the rantings of the ann coulter crowd and believe john mccain when he says he will listen to sam brownback and appoint judges like samuel alito and antonin scalia
2968052 indeed one looks in vain for a judge who is too ideologically conservative for mccain he voted to confirm robert bork clarence thomas and unless ive missed something every other republican judicial nominee voted on in his 22 years in the senate
2968053 even more tellingly as part of his negotiation in 2005 of what has been dubbed the
2968054 no one thinks john mccain would nominate ethically challenged judges but there is every reason to think that he will nominate ideological conservatives to the supreme court and lower federal courts
2968055 this is important because federal courts are already dominated by republican appointees seven of the nine justices and a sizeable majority of lower federal court judges were appointed by republican presidents with the courts liberal moderate judges on average 15 years older than the courts conservatives john mccain in the white house could easily deliver the court to the right wing for a generation
2968056 we are very fortunate that our president in these challenging days can rely on the counsel of a man who has demonstrated time and again the resolve experience and patriotism that will be required for success and the hard headed clear thinking necessary to prevail in this global fight between good and evil
2968057 loves lieberman and he is on the short list because lieberman has never embarrassed anyone never misspoken the first rule is dont take someone who costs you votes

2968060 im going to open up this case im going to sue cair im bringing a lawsuit back against them its going to cost me a fortune and when judge illston rejects it again which she will do because shes a minion of the bill clinton crowd im going to take it over her head and im going to go to the 9th circuit court of appeals where again im going to hit a stonewall and then im going to take it to the supreme court until eventually i force cair to describe who their funding sources are
2968061 how theyre targeting the midwest talk radio one talk show host at a time one company at a time dont you know that cair is going to come for you
2968062 first they came for michel savage and you didnt raise your voice and you laughed then they came after abercrombie and fitch and you didnt raise your voice because you werent in the retail business tomorrow theyll come after you and your business
2968063 one day youre going to hit the wrong judge in the wrong city at the wrong time and then the american people are going to find out where your funding is coming from
2968064 individuals entities who are and or were members of the us muslim brotherhoods palestine committee and or its organizations
2968065 cairs operational budget is funded by donations from american muslims
2968066 there is nothing criminal or immoral about accepting donations from foreign nationals
2968067 the u s government corporations and non profit organizations routinely receive money from foreign nationals

2968075 the vice president praised president saakashvili for his governments restraint offers of ceasefire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country
2968076 the vice president told president saakashvili that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2968077 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2968078 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2968079 the group is based on a subdivision of paratroopers it consists of more than 9 000 troops and more than 350 armoured vehicles alexander novitsky a spokesman for russias peacekeeping forces in abkhazia was quoted by interfax news agency as saying
2968080 the strengthening of the peacekeeping force is aimed at ruling out a repetition of the situation russian peacekeepers faced in tskhinvali
2968081 our troops have to defend civilians and avert a humanitarian catastrophe
2968082 following the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia the president of the republic believes there is a real perspective of rapidly finding a way out of the crisis

2968092 we certainly will be impressing on our athletes through their sports section managers that when their competition finishes and they go downtown it would be wise to be branded
2968093 we really should be insisting they should wear their team gear i think that might be a small precaution i think there is more likelihood of people keeping an eye out for you security and volunteers if you are in olympic gear
2968094 we ask our athletes when they are in official venues or canada olympic house to wear their hbc clothing and that is the only clothing edict we have

2968152 biggest one day jump against the euro in eight years
2968153 the magnitude of the dollars moves and the breaking of key technical levls suggest that a major shift in the outlook toward the dollar is occurring as massive positions are adjusted
2968154 the deteriorating market and economic conditions in the us continue to be the chief causes of the broad decline in the us currency
2968155 as long as these continue the dollar will fall regardless of any jawboning by policy makers which would be perceived as bluffing rather than communicating real policy intentions
2968156 the euro is rising not because it is a glorious currency but because people are desperate to get out of the dollar
2968157 for every day these individuals are outside of prison theyre escaping their sentence theyre cheating justice and theyre endangering north carolina citizens possibly

2968161 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2968162 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2968163 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2968164 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance but could still be squandered by hasty withdrawals or arbitrary timelines
2968165 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2968166 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
2968167 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go

2968197 the fact that russia is now going even beyond abkhazia and south ossetia bombing sites near to the georgian capital of tbilisi the fact that russia has mobilised at least part of the black sea fleet off the coast of georgia is entirely deplorable russian military behaviour

2968211 to come back from 1 0 down to go 2 1 up i thought we would have enough about us to see the game out

2968213 were still a million miles from where we want to be
2968214 with the economy slowing and energy bills on the rise it is totally unacceptable that hard pressed businesses are left so open to exploitation by energy suppliers
2968215 energywatch is currently providing a crucial service to thousands of businesses who are confused and frustrated by energy suppliers
2968216 if a super consumer group is to be established as the government plans there is little doubt in my mind that this service will be all but lost leaving companies at the mercy of the suppliers an obvious solution would be establishing a separate watchdog dedicated to assisting businesses

2968227 as you may be aware the town of stoneham is struggling like many other communities and we have been looking for ways to pull ourselves out of our financial problems without looking to the state for funding that is difficult to find
2968228 the secretary is sensitive to the concerns expressed by selectman rotondi on behalf of the town of stoneham but the secretarys duty is to make sure that all environmental impacts of developments like this one are avoided minimized or mitigated to the greatest extent possible
2968229 we do know that they the gutierrez co would like to sell

2968238 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2968239 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2968240 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2968241 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2968242 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2968243 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2968244 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2968245 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2968278 its quiet in gori people are continuing to leave the town and surrounding villages its more and more like a ghost town
2968279 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
2968280 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
2968281 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2968282 that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2968283 our task is clear we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides
2968284 we must move quickly this is not a diplomatic exercise its an exercise of survival
2968285 also expressed his concerns about the disproportionate use of force and lack of respect for the territorial integrity of georgia
2968286 the european union is prepared to play a role in stabilising this region on condition that the parties involved in the conflict cool down their emotions and end this escalating conflict
2968287 rather than acting as a neutral peacekeeper russia has escalated the hostilities through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside the conflict zone
2968288 we agreed that japan and the united states will cooperate in trying to stop the violence and to secure the territorial integrity of georgia
2968289 the rumors are out there in the market that there may be more regional banks in trouble thats obviously a concern for the market and this has driven people into more hard asset based investments like gold
2968290 i think well still get support coming in around the 950 00 level on the top side i would suggest that it might be somewhere around the 985 00 986 00 level

2968319 dat mensen die het hele jaar hebben gespaard om op reis te gaan hierdoor worden getroffen is wraakroepend

2968321 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

2968324 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
2968325 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2968326 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2968327 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2968328 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2968329 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2968330 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2968331 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2968332 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2968333 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2968334 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

2968350 we want to win games and to do that you need to keep clean sheets we have a defensive coach in wally downes who does a lot of work with us

2968352 we did concede a lot of goals last year but we want to put that right this year
2968353 you saw against forest that sonks and ivar ingimarsson headed everything away and hunty came in and did a great job at left back but its not just about the back four its about
2968354 i am very sorry to have to make this announcement and assure you we will proceed as quickly and sensitively as we are able
2968355 it is a possibility there will be that number of redundancies
2968356 but we have two other stadiums one at swindon and one at poole and obviously there will be offers of jobs wherever possible
2968357 at this stage we cant say how many redundancies there will be of course it is possible that the part time staff on the tote and behind the bars wont want to go to swindon or wherever
2968358 people here have known this has been on the cards for some time
2968359 it is sponsored by the bookmakers and i will be talking to them in the next few days to make a decision on it
2968360 the withdrawal of our casino operator and the credit crunch
2968361 we all knew this was going to happen but i dont think there is anyone here who believes that there will be a stadium here again in 2010

2968365 it is a great honour for me for celtic to come and play in this match
2968366 with my dad being a life long fan the club has always featured very strongly in our family
2968367 it was a massive game for us it was a like a cup final and we got the win
2968368 but we need to carry on from here there are still five games to go and by no way shape or form are we safe
2968369 i do hope to get someone in for the weekend but i have options and the easiest one for me is for stephen hunt to be in there relaxed as if he has been playing there for half a dozen years
2968370 but its a massive sea change for him to do that so i have to reflect on that and see what happens in the market

2968380 it is a strong possibility that we reduce it to two venues karachi and lahore said haroon logart chief executive of the international cricket council
2968381 that didnt provide us an opportunity to check the security arrangements so there was no way we can formulate an opinion on rawalpindi logart said
2968382 its not proper for me to single out any one person in the meeting he said
2968383 we all share the same concerns we have to ensure the safety of the players the media and the concerns were all common

2968385 my husband said he doesnt like me as a non smoker because i am being mean and fussing at him i probably have been but i am trying not to
2968386 if anything im going to try to be the predator now i would hope that teams would respect our situation now that the season has started the last thing any manager wants is a last minute rush
2968387 i read somewhere that i was happy that shorey went but i would have loved him and many other players to come in this season and say you know what we shouldnt have
2968388 i understand human nature though and it doesnt work that way shorey has been saying for over a year that he wants to go he has gone now and its history
2968389 i really need to do something about the left back position if hunt got injured wed end up having to play a right back at left back
2968390 perhaps the build up and anxiety over five weeks for both sets of teams didnt deliver the kind of performance we would like to have seen
2968391 we gave this young man a fixed penalty fine of 80 for wasting police time
2968392 what he did cost the emergency services and the hospital thousands of pounds from the police investigation the trip to hospital in an ambulance the scan in hospital
2968393 naturally we are all disappointed there were 300 runs to be made out there and so we were pleased to keep devon below that
2968394 i thought we could still do it but losing some early wickets didnt help
2968395 but while i and paul carter were at the wicket we appeared to be back in it and capable of going on to win
2968396 but when i was out then it just wasnt going to happen
2968397 the athletes village was like a big square a place to hang out a lot of people beautiful girls beautiful people it was amazing the village was right next to the cafeteria the cafeteria was so big it had all the foods in the world i always ate there i was living there
2968398 it was the best cafeteria i have ever seen they had everything there i still remember it and it was 20 years ago i still remember everything how it looked there
2968399 i didnt have much time to see the other sports to see other sports you had to drive everywhere everything was played in other places you had to have tickets and you had to order tickets
2968400 seoul was beautiful they had great street markets they had beautiful leather jackets there the funny thing was if they didnt have the size of you for a suit or shirt they took the measurements and the next day they had the size for you usually it takes two or three days there it only took a few hours
2968401 that day we didnt have to qualify the country is the one who sent you over there
2968402 kostya tszyu was there roy jones jr riddick bowe lennox lewis was there i was shocked when i saw bowe because three years before he was a light heavyweight i saw him in europe at a tournament and he was 175 pounds then he skipped over heavyweight all the way to super heavyweight he must have ingested gained so much weight
2968403 we got there a week before for the time change to acclimatize every day you had to watch your weight i had to lose five pounds

2968408 swimming is truly a sport for life and recent performances like those of 41 year old dara torres at the us olympic trials have demonstrated that swimmers can continue to compete at an elite level later in life
2968409 the regional masters meet was a great example of the tremendous interest were seeing in masters competition it was exciting to witness swimmers achieving at all levels from those who swam in their first competition to those who broke world records
2968410 a most fascinating phenomenon but one which leaves the mind facing a myriad of possibilities alternatives and conclusions which are at best strictly hypothetical with no sound basis in fact
2968411 the world is watching us so lets show them what we are made up of
2968412 we have trained long and hard for this day it is time to showcase our professionalism
2968413 availability of a large air to air range with threat replication contributes to the tremendous training value of the exercise the replication of the air war would witness iafs su 30 aircraft participating in suppression of enemy air defence air to air and air to ground missions

2968419 it was a massive honour just to actually be given the shirt when i came here
2968420 ill miss playing in it but its been retired in the right way and in honour of somebody who is a legend at the club and for football in general its a big honour for me
2968421 it was interesting a very different work out for us
2968422 it probably wasnt the most realistic game we could have had before playing wigan at home but it was a good spectacle and it was a good way to retire the shirt and honour bobby moore
2968423 it was intense people were tackling properly at this stage of the season you need to be comitted you cant be half hearted with all the pre season friendlies youve got to start putting your foot in at some point and people wanted to win the players wanted to win so it was a proper game

2968436 cymdeithas yr iaith gymraeg believes that if the housing crisis in wales is to be tackled then the thinking that has controlled housing policy since the days of margaret thatcher needs to be challenged and radically changed we must once again put the emphasise on the right to rent rather than continue with thatchers obsession with the right to buy
2968437 however in this case and in such a rural area the number of dwellings proposed is well above the allocation which will have an effect on the ability of the settlement and the community to absorb such a number of dwellings therefore it is considered that the development in terms of its size and scale is greater than that which is required in terms of local need which is reflected in the number of dwellings allocated in pontweli as a total
2968438 this makes a total nonsense of the whole planning system
2968439 as the welsh assembly government prepares the lco that will lead to a welsh language measure it is important that we emphasise that such a measure is wide ranging and comprehensive
2968440 cymdeithas yr iaith demands that welsh be given official status the rights of welsh speakers are recognised the private sector is included in the legislation and that a language commissioner is established in order to make sure that the new measure is adhered to
2968441 this is a critical time with a lot of camps starting
2968442 i tell them you wouldnt think of playing football without your helmet or pads well youre an athlete and food and fluids are part of your equipment
2968443 when i came here in january 2007 we were a fat football team
2968444 you cant flex fat fat cannot produce force fat will slow you down a high percent of body fat will exhaust you faster youre supposed to be an athlete
2968445 you play the game with your body take care of your body
2968446 nutrition is not that hard apple twinkie its not that difficult
2968447 so many young players think they can get in shape at the last minute which most of them do
2968448 the problem with that is that all of a sudden theyre trying to get in shape at the same time theyre learning their drills and most dont juggle all those things well
2968449 you cant wait until camp and say ok im going to change my body it doesnt work for high school it doesnt work for college and it doesnt work for pros
2968450 because youve got 75 80 percent of your kids going both ways playing offense and defense youve got to be in tip top shape to do that especially when youre playing in august and early september in western pennsylvania when it can get into the 90s during games
2968451 we try to tell our kids to eat the right foods take your protein shakes and your protein bars just so they can replenish any fuel that leaves their body during a workout we change their eating habits a little bit and they buy into it and so do the parents so that helps
2968452 the name of the game now when a college recruiter comes in they want to see how the kid moves
2968453 a kid who weighs 320 pounds and cant move it hurts him
2968454 i put on five 10 pounds because my mom is like a food nazi
2968455 maybe a little more because i couldnt run coach saw me and said get moving
2968456 but weight is not really a concern for me i can lose 10 pounds in a week i just do some running and eat healthy for a week and it comes right off
2968457 occasionally ill go up against a real big kid like a freak
2968458 but the bigger guy doesnt always win id rather face a big fat sloppy kid than a small quick kid you can use positioning and get in a fat players way theyre not real coordinated and just trip over themselves
2968459 we have kids who get weighed every day trying to get bigger
2968460 the key is you have to be able to run id rather have a kid that is undersized and can move than a kid who is huge because you cant even get some of those big kids to move some of these guys are just so big and it takes away from their performance
2968461 weve had big kids last year our two tackles were 6 6 295 and 275 but they were lean kids i would say we very rarely have heavy kids on our team kids who are big and heavy are going to wear down they cant perform in the fourth quarter and theres the risk of injury
2968462 were not trying to build big kids were trying to build football players
2968463 everybody asked me what do you think of this one compared to 1984 but 1984 was in l a so not many people were there today here i feel like im back home everybody calling me name they still remember me im so happy to be here in beijing
2968464 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around 7 p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
2968465 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
2968466 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation

2968473 this is the first book to combine lifestyle inspiration with a practical guide to the fast expanding universe of scuba diving
2968474 based on merit only and none of them paid to be included
2968475 we got four points in two matches we were 90 percent good 10 percent we maybe had some problems
2968476 i hope my team can do a better job and bring us a satisfying result in the group stage and play on into the quarterfinals
2968477 i think if we can make it to the second stage no matter which team we face we will play 100 percent
2968478 topping the group would allow china to play a third place team and likely avoid facing 2007 world cup champion germany or runner up brazil in the quarterfinals meanwhile argentina lost 2 1 to canada and 1 0 to sweden
2968479 the argentina team is a fast progressing very tough team
2968480 from the two matches they played against canada and against sweden we have seen that they are technically and mentally very good for us we must respect them
2968481 its true that we do have a little bit of pressure especially being the home team
2968482 sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well but its actually not the case
2968483 i played well hit some great winners got some good balls back i was playing very solid
2968484 i felt like i should have had today off but it was good practice
2968485 i wanted to go to the market today but we have to play so many matches

2968611 u s consumers are not buying but i think the great opportunity for us internationally is business that never touches u s shores
2968612 but we always look at different things and try to fit into the puzzle
2968613 you could say ups china should really have 25 000 employees the business is out there
2968614 if china were to follow the consumption patterns of the united states it would demand the available biocapacity of the entire planet an outcome that is likely to be a physical impossibility for china and for the other nations of the world
2968615 china has traditionally been forward looking in recognizing that its resource constraints pose a serious potential threat to its long term progress
2968616 chinas leaders are painfully aware that they can only secure their populations well being within the limits of what the planet can provide
2968617 education is particularly important notably for women community based programmes and health services can reduce malnutrition usually without food distribution this has been seen in tanzania through the iringa and child health and development programmes during the and the community nutrition project in senegal in 1996
2968618 accelerating globalisation of food production trade and marketing threatens the food security of poor communities in africa
2968619 without greater attention to nutrition increased child mortality morbidity and impaired intellectual development are inevitable
2968620 this is a critical time with a lot of camps starting
2968621 i tell them you wouldnt think of playing football without your helmet or pads well youre an athlete and food and fluids are part of your equipment
2968622 when i came here in january 2007 we were a fat football team
2968623 you cant flex fat fat cannot produce force fat will slow you down a high percent of body fat will exhaust you faster youre supposed to be an athlete
2968624 you play the game with your body take care of your body
2968625 nutrition is not that hard apple twinkie its not that difficult
2968626 so many young players think they can get in shape at the last minute which most of them do
2968627 the problem with that is that all of a sudden theyre trying to get in shape at the same time theyre learning their drills and most dont juggle all those things well
2968628 you cant wait until camp and say ok im going to change my body it doesnt work for high school it doesnt work for college and it doesnt work for pros
2968629 because youve got 75 80 percent of your kids going both ways playing offense and defense youve got to be in tip top shape to do that especially when youre playing in august and early september in western pennsylvania when it can get into the 90s during games
2968630 we try to tell our kids to eat the right foods take your protein shakes and your protein bars just so they can replenish any fuel that leaves their body during a workout we change their eating habits a little bit and they buy into it and so do the parents so that helps
2968631 the name of the game now when a college recruiter comes in they want to see how the kid moves
2968632 a kid who weighs 320 pounds and cant move it hurts him
2968633 i put on five 10 pounds because my mom is like a food nazi
2968634 maybe a little more because i couldnt run coach saw me and said get moving
2968635 but weight is not really a concern for me i can lose 10 pounds in a week i just do some running and eat healthy for a week and it comes right off
2968636 occasionally ill go up against a real big kid like a freak
2968637 but the bigger guy doesnt always win id rather face a big fat sloppy kid than a small quick kid you can use positioning and get in a fat players way theyre not real coordinated and just trip over themselves
2968638 we have kids who get weighed every day trying to get bigger
2968639 the key is you have to be able to run id rather have a kid that is undersized and can move than a kid who is huge because you cant even get some of those big kids to move some of these guys are just so big and it takes away from their performance
2968640 weve had big kids last year our two tackles were 6 6 295 and 275 but they were lean kids i would say we very rarely have heavy kids on our team kids who are big and heavy are going to wear down they cant perform in the fourth quarter and theres the risk of injury
2968641 were not trying to build big kids were trying to build football players
2968642 our customers saw the lowest bill increases of all water and wastewater companies when prices were set back in 2005
2968643 we have improved our efficiency and rank among the top water and wastewater companies in england and wales
2968644 we are determined to keep price increases as low as we can between 2010 and 2015 by prioritising our investment and being efficient
2968645 we believe that this proposal represents good value for money for our customers
2968646 this relatively modest increase in customers bills will allow us to deliver a significant investment programme to maintain high levels of service and improve the security of supply in spite of rising costs and the long term challenges we face
2968647 we recognise that anglian water is facing steeply rising energy costs and needs to carry out a lot of work by 2015 to ensure a safe reliable service for a growing number of consumers

2968911 mit seiner operation in s dossetien hat russland drei dinge bewiesen 1 seine armee kann erfolgreiche operationen ausf hren woran ausl ndische beobachter gezweifelt haben 2 die russen k nnen die von den us milit rinstrukteuren getrimmten kr fte besiegen 3 russland hat bewiesen dass sich die usa und die nato nicht in der situation befinden die f r sie ein milit risches eingreifen in diesen konflikt erm glichen k nnte
2968912 au erdem galten diese signale polen und tschechien die das amerikanische raketenabwehrsystem bei sich aufstellen sollen russland bedroht nat rlich niemanden mit einer intervention es fordert aber alle auf die meinung ber das kr fteverh ltnis in der region zu revidieren
2968913 russland k nnte dies nur erreichen wenn es zu einem angriff bereit sein wird w hrend georgien berpr fen wird ob moskau blufft oder nicht folglich k nnen sich die russen keinen bluff leisten
2968914 moskau k nnte sich mehr w nschen und sogar kr fte einsetzen um das zu erreichen
2968915 je mehr diplomatische initiativen es aber geben wird die sich nicht auf st rke st tzen desto sicherer wird sich russland f hlen

2968917 propaganda tricks inszenierte aufnahmen diese kunst haben sich die georgischen propagandisten nicht schlecht angeeignet und allem anschein nach lernen sie weiter das kann niemanden irref hren

2968919 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2968920 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2968921 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2968922 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2968923 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2968924 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies

2969045 to succeed in this research venture will require the integration of our scientific capability with the best research and development groups worldwide and strong industry partnerships
2969046 most projects within the collaboration cluster also have industry support and as new projects are developed industry is getting more involved
2969047 the proximity to industry will be what allows our technology to be implemented
2969048 the whole industry needs to explore deeper and more remotely to access new oil and gas and to make this viable costs need to be lowered reducing the size and cost of platforms and eventually eliminating them is a sensible way of doing this
2969049 we need to provide industry with the ability to evaluate and plot the best route for the pipeline
2969050 that is which route will be the most economical but also minimise any risk from landslides strong currents seabed movement and other geo and environmental hazards
2969051 in some areas such as those exposed to certain geohazards current technology can only provide a qualitative assessment of the level of risk we aim to develop state of the art numerical analysis models to quantify it
2969052 in other words instead of having simply a high or low risk associated with specific hazards you can say for example there is a 0 1 per cent risk of failure within the lifetime of the pipeline such precise modelling reduces uncertainties and risks leading to less conservative assumptions and design limits and consequently lower costs and greater feasibility
2969053 we need to ensure that the tools we provide to industry can build monitor and maintain a pipeline to withstand the rigours of the harsh marine environments and avoid this disaster scenario altogether
2969054 although the technologies arising from this cluster are designed to help with issues specific to australian conditions they will help build a local knowledge industry and many will be applicable worldwide and available for export along with the accumulated knowledge
2969055 the clusters research needs to increase the attractiveness to industry of such investment otherwise competing opportunities overseas could be of more interest to these companies

2969133 germany will be an important rally for everyone as it will set the tone for teams performance on the remaining asphalt rounds of the championship in spain and corsica its even more crucial for us however as its the tarmac debut for the new impreza
2969134 but testing has been very encouraging petter solberg and chris atkinson have traditionally been fast in germany and we now have the experience of three rallies to build on
2969135 i think its been a solid start to the year
2969136 i wouldnt say i am overly happy with it but i wouldnt say i am disappointed with it either there are four races left and there is the chance to get some good results in but i have made progress and have improved on last year
2969137 the situation changes every year in terms of how quick and how good your car is but i have done a better job than last year for me it is great to have gary paffett as a team mate given he is a past champion and a
2969138 i think it always been my aim to score points but you have to realistic about your chances of achieving that there are a lot of 07 cars that have scored points and i have been close and put in some good performances for sure i want to score points and its what ill be working on
2969139 out of my research on this has come a list of tools technologies and other artifacts of my generation that will probably disappear within the next generation just as fax essentially disappeared less than 20 years after it first became popular and just as cds which my generation thought were the last word in music storage are disappearing even faster
2969140 corporate websites i recently co judged a competition of nominated best of class business websites and i was aghast at how unnavigable and useless most of them were my own research has indicated that most people who visit these sites are job seekers the media and competitors a combination of marketing pr hype just in case recycled internal junk and self congratulation most corporate websites are devoid of useful content and those that do have useful stuff have it buried where it cant be found you just cant put a filing cabinet up online and expect people to wade through it and your relationship isnt with company x its with individual y at that company individual ys blog with lots of contact info timely casual style articles and useful links and instant connectivity options is to the corporate website what your personal company rep is to walking into the company cold and asking for help next gen blogs by individual employees personal casual chatty accessible hosted but uncensored by the employer will soon blow even the best corporate websites out of the water

2969142 he is a good boy a real mummys boy and his last words to me before the accident were to tell me he loved me an hour later he was in intensive care
2969143 it was heartbreaking to see him in such a state and it is touch and go at the moment but he woke up asking for me and for his little sister on saturday night so that has given us a little bit of hope
2969144 were a really close family and were all supporting each other through this my boys have been great but its very hard for all of us were still in shock we cant believe what has happened
2969145 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
2969146 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
2969147 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
2969148 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
2969149 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
2969150 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
2969151 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
2969152 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
2969153 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
2969154 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
2969155 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
2969156 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
2969157 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
2969158 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
2969159 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
2969160 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality
2969161 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
2969162 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
2969163 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
2969164 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
2969165 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
2969166 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
2969167 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
2969168 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
2969169 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
2969170 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
2969171 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it
2969172 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2969173 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2969174 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2969175 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2969176 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2969177 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2969178 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2969179 we think people take political information from all sorts of sources in their daily life
2969180 and for some people oprah is clearly one of them
2969181 peluncuran iphone 3g dari apple pada 11 juli lalu memberikan dampak yang hebat pada penjualan ponsel dunia pada bulan juli dan juga juni
2969182 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2969183 if nothing else with four children i should probably play the lottery
2969184 its really unfortunate no one is happy when the whistle went one of our opponents hit one of our players in the back of the head
2969185 were now not going to play clubs in the future well definitely not this club we will rather forfeit the points
2969186 we need to acknowledge that we have a serious problem
2969187 im personally a very competitive person and clearly we are passionate abut the teams we support
2969188 but just as our country has taken a path of reconciliation and peace so too in this wonderful game we have to take uncompromising steps
2969189 we will deal very harshly with any player parent or spectator who doesnt actively promote tolerance sportsmanship and accept referees decisions and outcomes
2969190 its so vicious so nasty its killing the game at club level
2969191 im glad that theres support from a legislative level wed be very keen to speak to mr dugmore

2969200 and when you reap the harvest of your land you shall not reap your field right up to its edge nor shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest you shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner i am the lord your god
2969201 selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as he had need

2969205 these are the appointed feasts of the lord which you shall proclaim as times of holy convocation for presenting to the lord food offerings burnt offerings and grain offerings sacrifices and drink offerings each on its proper day 38 besides the lords sabbaths and besides your gifts and besides all your vow offerings and besides all your freewill offerings which you give to the lord
2969206 on the fifteenth day of the seventh month when you have gathered in the produce of the land you shall celebrate the feast of the lord seven days on the first day shall be a solemn rest and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest 40 and you shall take on the first day the fruit of splendid trees branches of palm trees and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook and you shall rejoice before the lord your god seven days 41 you shall celebrate it as a feast to the lord for seven days in the year it is a statute forever throughout your generations you shall celebrate it in the seventh month 42 you shall dwell in booths for seven days all native israelites shall dwell in booths 43 that your generations may know that i made the people of israel dwell in booths when i brought them out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god
2969207 command the people of israel to bring you pure oil from beaten olives for the lamp that a light may be kept burning regularly
2969208 you shall take fine flour and bake twelve loaves from it two tenths of an ephah shall be in each loaf 6 and you shall set them in two piles six in a pile on the table of pure gold before the lord 7 and you shall put pure frankincense on each pile that it may go with the bread as a memorial portion as a food offering to the lord 8 every sabbath day aaron shall arrange it before the lord regularly it is from the people of israel as a covenant forever 9 and it shall be for aaron and his sons and they shall eat it in a holy place since it is for him a most holy portion out of the lords food offerings a perpetual due

2969235 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead the central bank said in its quarterly monetary policy statement released today
2969236 we shouldnt be surprised that the global oil shock and the global credit crunch together with eight official rate rises in three years are impacting on our economy treasurer wayne swan told the global foundation
2969237 like the rest of the world we havent been immune from these global difficulties
2969238 in a globalised economy we dont expect a smooth rise but we are better placed than most other countries to withstand the fallout
2969239 this could lead to a significant deterioration in the outlook for the australian economy and commodity markets the rba said
2969240 past experience suggests that once the bank has made up its mind it tends not to wait too long before acting especially when it probably discussed cutting rates this month abn amro chief economist kieran davies said
2969241 this suggests that the public would support government intervention that would regulate the industry and protect the general public against rate rises by banks essential said
2969242 their need to do so is underlined by the reserve banks observation that their wholesale funding costs are easing mr turnbull told reporters in sydney

2969287 bullying of this kind can be quite insidious it can just be a look that a child is given

2969289 young people are image conscious and a lot of bullying is based on appearance
2969290 advertising and marketing have made our society increasingly image conscious and our children are suffering the consequences
2969291 schools and colleges should be places where all children feel equal but it is virtually impossible for schools to protect their pupils from the harsher aspects of these commercial influences
2969292 advertising and marketing are just a small part of a much wider range of influences on children in todays consumer society
2969293 childrens attitudes and values are primarily formed by the culture they live in and their personal contacts their families and friends
2969294 the advertising industry in the uk takes a responsible approach and there are strong and effective advertising controls that require special care to be taken as regards children

2969344 die entscheidung des georgischen pr sidenten michail saakaschwili zur milit rischen intervention in s dossetien war ein tragischer fehler der staatschef durfte trotz aller provokationen der separatisten das recht nicht in die eigene hand nehmen das gewaltsame vorgehen gegen ossetien ist nicht zu rechtfertigen die entscheidung bedeutete obendrein aber auch einen politischen fehler und daraus versucht russlands ministerpr sident wladimir putin nun kapital zu schlagen seine berzogene reaktion macht deutlich dass er die absicht hat russlands hegemonie in der region zu st rken
2969345 gesamtheit der beziehungen zwischen russland und westen in der waagschale
2969346 wladimir putin hat das verstanden schlie lich hat er bei der r ckkehr von der er ffnung der olympischen spiele im kaukasus halt gemacht zum einen wollte er damit die russischen soldaten ermutigen die an der schlacht teilnehmen aber vor allem wollte er george w bush und den europ ern zeigen welche bedeutung moskau dem derzeitigen geschehen in georgien beimisst weil es an der spitze europas steht befindet sich frankreich in einer schl sselposition f r eine vermittlung die f r die zukunft der ost west beziehungen entscheidend ist
2969347 milit risch hat georgien die erwartete schmerzhafte lektion der russen bekommen
2969348 der krieg in s dossetien ist eine stunde der wahrheit f r polen und europa f r polen weil wir nato und eu durch unseren beitritt auf ereignisse im kaukasus au erordentlich sensibilisiert haben f r europa weil es jetzt eine chance hat sich zu rehabilitieren f r die jahrelange politik die darin bestand die augen f r probleme der v lker zu schlie en die ein objekt der neoimperialen politik moskaus gewesen waren der grund war die erhaltung guter kontakte zu russland der moment ist g nstig den eu vorsitz hat mit frankreich ein gro es europ isches land das niemals einen hehl daraus machte dass die eu zum player in der weltpolitik werden soll
2969349 die russischen absichten zeigen sich auch in den bombardierungen von zielen in georgien selbst ziele sind st dte aber auch l einrichtungen fabriken und milit rbasen ganz offensichtlich kommt russland nicht um seine br der zu retten sondern ergreift die gelegenheit um der infrastruktur des wirtschaftlich ziemlich erfolgreichen georgiens einen schweren schlag zu versetzen
2969350 die verh ltnism igkeit des jetzigen russischen eingriffs kann infrage gestellt werden ansonsten ist es aber eine ebensolche humanit re intervention wie jene der nato 1999 im kosovo gegen jugoslawien saakaschwili aber lebt in einer welt in der doppelmoral die norm ist daher konnte er kaum kalkulieren die unterst tzer des georgischen pr sidenten die an druck auf russland interessiert waren und saakaschwili st ndig best rkten waren nicht hilfreich saakaschwili hat daher ein eigentor geschossen
2969351 man kann sich des gedankens nicht erwehren dass saakaschwili ein eingreifen des westens herausfordern wollte er hat es noch nicht verwunden dass eine mehrheit beim nato gipfel im april seinem land die mitgliedschaft in dem milit rb ndnis verweigerte
2969352 der wehrlose saakaschwili hat den westen um hilfe gebeten keine gro macht hat diesen appell beantwortet mehr noch wahrscheinlich atmen die westlichen staaten auf erleichtert dar ber dass georgien beim nato gipfel in bukarest kein gr nes licht f r einen nato beitritt bekommen hat denn sonst w ren frankreich deutschland und sogar rum nien verpflichtet das georgische territorium im fall eines russischen angriffs zu verteidigen der georgische pr sident hat auch an dieser front verloren und das nato treffen im dezember bei dem der kaukasische staat zur vorbereitung eines beitritts in den membership action plan h tte aufgenommen werden sollen wird verschoben oder annulliert werden denn auch europa kann sich keinen krieg gegen russland leisten
2969353 w re georgien schon nato mitglied wie es vor allem die usa wollten dann h tte die allianz jetzt einen verteidigungsfall amerikaner deutsche kanadier spanier sie alle m ssten den georgiern zu hilfe eilen und die anlaufende invasion der kaukasusrepublik zu beenden versuchen man kann es aber auch weiterdenken w re georgien mitglied der nato kommenden dezember wollten die nato minister ber den beitrittsplan beraten w re es gar nicht erst zu dem krieg gekommen russland h tte nicht gewagt georgien anzugreifen und michail saakaschwili h tte es sich zweimal berlegt mit freundlicher nachhilfe des westens ob er die anderen nato staaten in einen konflikt um eine winzige separatistenprovinz ziehen darf
2969354 eine erkl rung des internationalen olympischen komitees die nach dem ausbrechen des krieges zwischen georgien und russland verbreitet wurde fasst sehr gut die epoche in der wir leben und den geistigen zustand der diese charakterisiert zusammen ein zustand der aus blindheit ignoranz militanter dummheit und unverantwortlichkeit gemacht ist
2969355 das ist nicht das was die welt in diesem moment sehen m chte

2969360 carrying on business as a social club without a business licence

2969363 police had visited approximately 10 times and never told him the door should be unlocked
2969364 was told to pee in a cup by a police officer
2969365 police have stated they feel there are criminal activities at this premise however they have given no proof of such activities and have used suspect tactics and rationale for gaining access to the premises
2969366 he submitted that a business licence cannot be denied based only on the fact that the police do not like the business
2969367 the police may have their reasons for watching a particular restaurant or premise
2969368 the concern of the city was it was licensed as a restaurant but they werent acting like a restaurant they werent serving food and they werent open to the public

2969396 music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life
2969397 if a composer could say what he had to say in words he would not bother trying to say it in music
2969398 there is nothing in the world so much like prayer as music is
2969399 music is the mediator between the spiritual and the sensual life
2969400 i have my own particular sorrows loves delights and you have yours but sorrow gladness yearning hope love belong to all of us in all times and in all places music is the only means whereby we feel these emotions in their universality
2969401 music cleanses the understanding inspires it and lifts it into a realm which it would not reach if it were left to itself
2969402 music is the wine which inspires one to new generative processes and i am bacchus who presses out this glorious wine for mankind and makes them spiritually drunken
2969403 music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent
2969404 its language is a language which the soul alone understands but which the soul can never translate
2969405 music expresses feeling and thought without language it was below and before speech and it is above and beyond all words
2969406 silence is the fabric upon which the notes are woven
2969407 the discovery of song and the creation of musical instruments both owed their origin to a human impulse which lies much deeper than conscious intention the need for rhythm in life the need is a deep one transcending thought and disregarded at our peril
2969408 it is incontestable that music induces in us a sense of the infinite and the contemplation of the invisible
2969409 music is well said to be the speech of angels

2969457 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2969458 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies

2969460 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2969461 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2969462 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2969463 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2969464 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2969465 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2969466 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2969467 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2969468 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2969469 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2969470 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2969471 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

2969477 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2969478 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2969479 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

2969485 whos the black private dick whos a sex machine to all the chicks
2969486 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2969487 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2969488 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2969489 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2969490 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2969491 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2969492 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2969493 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2969494 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2969495 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2969496 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2969497 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2969498 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2969499 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2969500 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2969501 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2969502 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2969503 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2969504 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2969505 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2969506 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2969507 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2969508 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2969509 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2969510 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2969511 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2969512 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2969513 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2969514 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2969515 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2969516 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2969517 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2969518 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2969519 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2969520 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2969521 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2969522 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2969523 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2969524 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2969525 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2969526 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2969527 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2969528 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2969529 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2969530 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2969531 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2969532 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2969533 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2969534 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2969535 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2969536 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2969537 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2969538 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2969539 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2969540 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2969541 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2969542 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2969543 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2969544 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2969545 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2969546 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2969547 who are open to doing something on the production side
2969548 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2969549 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2969550 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2969551 what natural disaster happened now maybe another woman said she slept with john edwards
2969552 we can do this the easy way or the hard way
2969553 everyone feels the same when they come in here but it will be over quite quickly
2969554 hahahaha well if you dont have your health what do you have
2969555 you need to stay in shape more than i do
2969556 hey hold on a minute i went to get it yesterday
2969557 i know you did mikey but i have things i need to do
2969558 like what what the hell is there to do in this place except for stare at the walls
2969559 i have exercise to do im really getting into it at the moment
2969560 no it cant because i will tire myself out walking over to the av building
2969561 fine i will go today but tomorrow its your turn you lazy bastard see ya in about an hour
2969562 im gonna ask the questions from now on you were following me out there on the rooftops so who the hell are you
2969563 whoa whoa whoa hang on buddy i dont want any trouble i just want some answers i was following you because i dont know how the hell i ended up in this damn city
2969564 my names nick i think i cant remember my real name ive been here for 3 months and cant remember anything
2969565 well nick forgive me for not feeling sorry for you but ive been here in this city for fifteen years
2969566 so you must know something about why we are here then
2969567 i probably dont know any more than you do my friend ive been here for fifteen years and still cant piece together a decent memory
2969568 youre here for a reason you have something that they want maybe its your good looks hahahaha
2969569 you sure ask a lot of questions kid but im afraid i dont have all the answers over the years ive seen people come and go from this place like tourists every few months the place fills up with people just like yourself and then the next year they are gone as if they never existed
2969570 there you go again with the questions why dont you listen for a change like i was saying people come and people go i dunno what happens to them maybe they are on vacation or maybe they are part of some special training program hahaha i rememeber when i first woke up in this place they called me up to that damn building and that old bastard made me swallow that crap god only those what it was that they put in my mouth the only thing i can remember is some guy coming into my room at night and sticking a needle in me
2969571 yeah i do remember it its one of the only damn things i can remember
2969572 well kid welcome to the family you better get used to it because cos you might be here for a while
2969573 not a damn thing why is he your daddy haha
2969574 no i saw the name scratched into the wall whats the deal with that wall
2969575 will you stop asking me questions i dont know the answer to
2969576 i had a name once but it died out the moment i came here all i have now is the damn name they gave me
2969577 well eric you seem to have given up all hope on finding anything out in this place so thats where the similarities between us end
2969578 hahahaha youre very confident kid you want answers do ya
2969579 okay then get up off that bed and come with me
2969580 so erm do you remember the old guy who put the stuff in your mouth eric
2969581 you mean the surgeon yeah i remember him why do you ask
2969582 well nick it seems to me like you have an awful lot of anger inside of you did you ever think that the surgeon might have been giving you an antidote when he made you swallow that stuff
2969583 i dont know but me and you cant remember anything so maybe before we came here we were all terminally ill and they have just cured us by making us swallow an antidote we cant be sure of anything really
2969584 i dont believe that crap for a second if we were ill then why have some guy come to us in the night with a needle huh
2969585 do you think you could stop calling me son and kid please
2969586 well until you find out well stick with kid hahahaha
2969587 i remember it alright its a damn television set oh my god where did you find this
2969588 haha well ive been here fifteen years so ive picked up some bits and pieces over the years let me explain something to you kid ive never given up hope that i might one day get to escape from this place ive covered every inch of ground in this city searching for bits and pieces and it took me two years to assemble this thing chubb get out here
2969589 no not this time kid theres somebody i want you to meet
2969590 well the kid wants some answers chubb so i think hes just the guy we need to help us out with our little mission
2969591 well ill let you in on a little secret eric and myself have been here over ten years and we are finally on to something here it took us years to put this tv together and we didnt assemble it so we could stay up late and watch movies
2969592 if youre gonna help us you have too listen real close
2969593 well smart ass me and eric have been trying too find a way out since we met here and weve come across bits and pieces over the years that have helped us put things together right now there is a micro cam corder on this rooftop looking over at the av building you wouldnt believe the kinds of crap we have found lying around places over the years our plan is to someway attach the micro camera to one of the cyborg units so that we can see what goes on in the av building
2969594 oh i think i see where youre going with this one let me get this straight you guys think that im gonna put my ass on the line and go out there and get myself killed whilst trying to connect some dumb piece of machinery to another dumb piece of machinery well screw that
2969595 hold up kid youve got it wrong we have a plan we can destrow those metal monstrousities easily
2969596 are you kidding me those things are monstrous you would need a bazooka to take one of those things out
2969597 these machines are built to look intimidating but the fact is they are crudely made
2969598 because they are made from dead human bodies they may have some pretty heavy weapons but one gun shot to the head and they go down trust me
2969599 beacuse i recognise every single one of them everytime someone is killed on the streets by one of those machines i have watched it and when you look into the eyes of someone dying you never forget their face
2969600 well did it ever occur to you that there plan for us may be to melt us down and make us into cyborgs
2969601 but the truth is we wont know what their plan is until we follow through with our plan so enough with the questions wiseguy are you going to help us or what
2969602 its a map of the city every single inch of it is marked on that map
2969603 they each patrol a specific area and the red dots are the points in which they start from
2969604 we have reason to believe that the cyborgs get to the streets through a series of underground tunnels that come from the av building and lead onto the streets if we can find out where they come out from we can find out how to get into the building
2969605 what if they dont even come from the av building they could just be hiding in other buildings and then come out to the streets at night
2969606 i keep telling you that i have been over every bit of the city i have explored every building and there no cyborgs hiding in any of them trust me
2969607 my room mate he will be back from the av building now and will be wondering where i am
2969608 wait a minute how can you have a room mate
2969609 i dont know hes been there since ive been here
2969610 yeah but i didnt when i first came here though
2969611 maybe but then again you have said that after almost every question i have asked you both so i think im due a sensible answer
2969612 when i first came here there was about 200 people living in the city all of us were here for about a year before they decided it was time for us to go one night the cyborgs came for us they took people from their rooms i could hear the sound of people screaming it was so loud it was almost deafening they came and took people back to the av building i saw a huge door open up on the front of the bulding and the cyborgs began to drag the people inside i panicked and tried to hide i could hear something moving in my room it was so dark though i couldnt see but i knew i had to get out of there i made a run for it and when i got outside my front door i headed up to the top of the building when i made it to the top i was confronted by eric and he brought me down here and said that we were safe
2969613 yeah but i think now theyve forgotten about us pal hahaha
2969614 i have an idea what if i could lead one of the cyborgs up onto the roof i could begin to lead it across the boards and then knock it off so it falls down to the ground would that destroy it do you think
2969615 hmmmmmmmm well i dont think anything could survive a fall like that
2969616 would we beable to get it in here if it falls to the ground though
2969617 it leads out onto the street at the moment its covered up by a dumpster but if we could knock the cyborg off the roof so it lands near this door then we can get it down here in a mere matter of seconds
2969618 mikey or whatever his name was you said he was your room mate
2969619 so whats the deal with him does he know where you are
2969620 no he doesnt he went to get our food from the av building and then i went to check out that wall
2969621 so erm he went to get the food for both of you
2969622 yeah i guess so he went yesterday aswell and thats when i discovered the wall
2969623 oh i see do you think he is getting suspicious or worried about where you are
2969624 i doubt it i trust the guy and he trusts me
2969625 think about it you have no memory at all so this guy could be one of your enemies from the past
2969626 anyway lets get back to the matter at hand i wanna give ya something kid
2969627 i aint talkin about the map kid i want you to have this
2969628 yes to both questions the ugly son of a bitch put a big hole in the floor outside he came crashing straight through were about to cut it open
2969629 whats gonna happen now are we gonna hook the camera up it
2969630 not yet you idiot firat we wanna examine the ugly son of a bitch see what goes on inside its system
2969631 hmmmmm the fall has caused quite a bit of damage to the exterior
2969632 can you guys do anything to fix it because i think that the guys over in the av building will notice that this sucker i only half there
2969633 yeah i should beable to patch things up might have to cover some parts up with some metal sheets but it will look ok
2969634 eric nick you guys might wanna stand back cos im about to take the face off
2969635 these are not ordinary goggles kid come here and take a look
2969636 infa red kid instead of seeing what we see it picks up the heat from our bodies and makes us easier to see
2969637 when i was out there though it seemed like it couldnt see me at times even when i was standing right infront of it whats that all about
2969638 i cant concentrate with you asking all these questions kid so can you just chill out for a few minutes
2969639 whats that supposed to mean where the hell are we
2969640 welcome to abruptus vacuo buddy dont suppose you remember who you are do you
2969641 i i dont remember anything whats going on am i dead
2969642 im afraid i cant answer all your questions buddy i just woke up here about an hour before you i was hoping you would pull through do you have a name
2969643 hey hey come on man dont cry well figure this shit out and in the mean time what do you want me to call you
2969644 you look like a nick to me hahaha you can make up a name for me until i figure out my real name
2969645 hey did you by any chance have a nightmare about a guy with a needle before you woke up thats the only thing i can remember is some guy coming at me in the dark with a needle
2969646 hmmmmm sounds spooky but i honestly dont remember anybody with a needle im afraid buddy anyway looks like were stuck here for a while take a look out there
2969647 it seems that way whoever or whatever it was that put us in here they obviously dont want us to leave
2969648 what the hell have you done chubb this will take hours to put back together
2969649 well do one of you wanna fill me in then
2969650 this is hooked up to a device that detects signal when an alarm goes off the alarm is transmitted from another machine most likely something from the av building
2969651 it comes from the aerial unit i remember when i was out there i was trying to get the attention of the cyborg but it couldnt see me but when the aerial unit was aware of my presence the cyborg started chasing me
2969652 the cyborgs are controlled from the aerial unit atleast i think they are because look at these
2969653 the cyborg can pick up sounds and the sounds it picks up must be transmitted back to the aerial unit
2969654 well thats just great shit they probably know about the entire plan now what the hell are we gonna do
2969655 we found this to it should tell you all you need to know
2969656 and we can hook it up to the tv monitor and see whats on it then we might beable to now what goes on inside their metal heads
2969657 how do you know how to do all this if you have no memory then how the hell do you know what youre doing
2969658 well to tell you the truth kid i dont know but let me put it like this do you remember how to read
2969659 well then before you came here you obviously knew how to read before i came here maybe i knew how to put things like this together thats the only explanation i have for ya son old memories creeping through thats all it is when i asked you about the tv monitor you knew what it was so maybe just maybe you had seen one before you came here
2969660 okay guys here we go someone better go and get some popcorn because its movie time hahaha
2969661 8 00am compulsary target settings 9 00am infra red monitoring
2969662 as if we really give a rats ass about what these things do in their spare time
2969663 we can do this the easy way or the hard way
2969664 everyone feels the same when they come in here but it will be over quite quickly
2969665 hahahaha well if you dont have your health what do you have
2969666 you need to stay in shape more than i do
2969667 hey hold on a minute i went to get it yesterday
2969668 i know you did mikey but i have things i need to do
2969669 like what what the hell is there to do in this place except for stare at the walls
2969670 i have exercise to do im really getting into it at the moment
2969671 no it cant because i will tire myself out walking over to the av building
2969672 fine i will go today but tomorrow its your turn you lazy bastard see ya in about an hour
2969673 im gonna ask the questions from now on you were following me out there on the rooftops so who the hell are you
2969674 whoa whoa whoa hang on buddy i dont want any trouble i just want some answers i was following you because i dont know how the hell i ended up in this damn city
2969675 my names nick i think i cant remember my real name ive been here for 3 months and cant remember anything
2969676 well nick forgive me for not feeling sorry for you but ive been here in this city for fifteen years
2969677 so you must know something about why we are here then
2969678 i probably dont know any more than you do my friend ive been here for fifteen years and still cant piece together a decent memory
2969679 youre here for a reason you have something that they want maybe its your good looks hahahaha
2969680 you sure ask a lot of questions kid but im afraid i dont have all the answers over the years ive seen people come and go from this place like tourists every few months the place fills up with people just like yourself and then the next year they are gone as if they never existed
2969681 there you go again with the questions why dont you listen for a change like i was saying people come and people go i dunno what happens to them maybe they are on vacation or maybe they are part of some special training program hahaha i rememeber when i first woke up in this place they called me up to that damn building and that old bastard made me swallow that crap god only those what it was that they put in my mouth the only thing i can remember is some guy coming into my room at night and sticking a needle in me
2969682 yeah i do remember it its one of the only damn things i can remember
2969683 well kid welcome to the family you better get used to it because cos you might be here for a while
2969684 not a damn thing why is he your daddy haha
2969685 no i saw the name scratched into the wall whats the deal with that wall
2969686 will you stop asking me questions i dont know the answer to
2969687 i had a name once but it died out the moment i came here all i have now is the damn name they gave me
2969688 well eric you seem to have given up all hope on finding anything out in this place so thats where the similarities between us end
2969689 hahahaha youre very confident kid you want answers do ya
2969690 okay then get up off that bed and come with me
2969691 so erm do you remember the old guy who put the stuff in your mouth eric
2969692 you mean the surgeon yeah i remember him why do you ask
2969693 well nick it seems to me like you have an awful lot of anger inside of you did you ever think that the surgeon might have been giving you an antidote when he made you swallow that stuff
2969694 i dont know but me and you cant remember anything so maybe before we came here we were all terminally ill and they have just cured us by making us swallow an antidote we cant be sure of anything really
2969695 i dont believe that crap for a second if we were ill then why have some guy come to us in the night with a needle huh
2969696 do you think you could stop calling me son and kid please
2969697 well until you find out well stick with kid hahahaha
2969698 i remember it alright its a damn television set oh my god where did you find this
2969699 haha well ive been here fifteen years so ive picked up some bits and pieces over the years let me explain something to you kid ive never given up hope that i might one day get to escape from this place ive covered every inch of ground in this city searching for bits and pieces and it took me two years to assemble this thing chubb get out here
2969700 no not this time kid theres somebody i want you to meet
2969701 well the kid wants some answers chubb so i think hes just the guy we need to help us out with our little mission
2969702 well ill let you in on a little secret eric and myself have been here over ten years and we are finally on to something here it took us years to put this tv together and we didnt assemble it so we could stay up late and watch movies
2969703 if youre gonna help us you have too listen real close
2969704 well smart ass me and eric have been trying too find a way out since we met here and weve come across bits and pieces over the years that have helped us put things together right now there is a micro cam corder on this rooftop looking over at the av building you wouldnt believe the kinds of crap we have found lying around places over the years our plan is to someway attach the micro camera to one of the cyborg units so that we can see what goes on in the av building
2969705 oh i think i see where youre going with this one let me get this straight you guys think that im gonna put my ass on the line and go out there and get myself killed whilst trying to connect some dumb piece of machinery to another dumb piece of machinery well screw that
2969706 hold up kid youve got it wrong we have a plan we can destrow those metal monstrousities easily
2969707 are you kidding me those things are monstrous you would need a bazooka to take one of those things out
2969708 these machines are built to look intimidating but the fact is they are crudely made
2969709 because they are made from dead human bodies they may have some pretty heavy weapons but one gun shot to the head and they go down trust me
2969710 beacuse i recognise every single one of them everytime someone is killed on the streets by one of those machines i have watched it and when you look into the eyes of someone dying you never forget their face
2969711 well did it ever occur to you that there plan for us may be to melt us down and make us into cyborgs
2969712 but the truth is we wont know what their plan is until we follow through with our plan so enough with the questions wiseguy are you going to help us or what
2969713 its a map of the city every single inch of it is marked on that map
2969714 they each patrol a specific area and the red dots are the points in which they start from
2969715 we have reason to believe that the cyborgs get to the streets through a series of underground tunnels that come from the av building and lead onto the streets if we can find out where they come out from we can find out how to get into the building
2969716 what if they dont even come from the av building they could just be hiding in other buildings and then come out to the streets at night
2969717 i keep telling you that i have been over every bit of the city i have explored every building and there no cyborgs hiding in any of them trust me
2969718 my room mate he will be back from the av building now and will be wondering where i am
2969719 wait a minute how can you have a room mate
2969720 i dont know hes been there since ive been here
2969721 yeah but i didnt when i first came here though
2969722 maybe but then again you have said that after almost every question i have asked you both so i think im due a sensible answer
2969723 when i first came here there was about 200 people living in the city all of us were here for about a year before they decided it was time for us to go one night the cyborgs came for us they took people from their rooms i could hear the sound of people screaming it was so loud it was almost deafening they came and took people back to the av building i saw a huge door open up on the front of the bulding and the cyborgs began to drag the people inside i panicked and tried to hide i could hear something moving in my room it was so dark though i couldnt see but i knew i had to get out of there i made a run for it and when i got outside my front door i headed up to the top of the building when i made it to the top i was confronted by eric and he brought me down here and said that we were safe
2969724 yeah but i think now theyve forgotten about us pal hahaha
2969725 i have an idea what if i could lead one of the cyborgs up onto the roof i could begin to lead it across the boards and then knock it off so it falls down to the ground would that destroy it do you think
2969726 hmmmmmmmm well i dont think anything could survive a fall like that
2969727 would we beable to get it in here if it falls to the ground though
2969728 it leads out onto the street at the moment its covered up by a dumpster but if we could knock the cyborg off the roof so it lands near this door then we can get it down here in a mere matter of seconds
2969729 mikey or whatever his name was you said he was your room mate
2969730 so whats the deal with him does he know where you are
2969731 no he doesnt he went to get our food from the av building and then i went to check out that wall
2969732 so erm he went to get the food for both of you
2969733 yeah i guess so he went yesterday aswell and thats when i discovered the wall
2969734 oh i see do you think he is getting suspicious or worried about where you are
2969735 i doubt it i trust the guy and he trusts me
2969736 think about it you have no memory at all so this guy could be one of your enemies from the past
2969737 anyway lets get back to the matter at hand i wanna give ya something kid
2969738 i aint talkin about the map kid i want you to have this
2969739 yes to both questions the ugly son of a bitch put a big hole in the floor outside he came crashing straight through were about to cut it open
2969740 whats gonna happen now are we gonna hook the camera up it
2969741 not yet you idiot firat we wanna examine the ugly son of a bitch see what goes on inside its system
2969742 hmmmmm the fall has caused quite a bit of damage to the exterior
2969743 can you guys do anything to fix it because i think that the guys over in the av building will notice that this sucker i only half there
2969744 yeah i should beable to patch things up might have to cover some parts up with some metal sheets but it will look ok
2969745 eric nick you guys might wanna stand back cos im about to take the face off
2969746 these are not ordinary goggles kid come here and take a look
2969747 infa red kid instead of seeing what we see it picks up the heat from our bodies and makes us easier to see
2969748 when i was out there though it seemed like it couldnt see me at times even when i was standing right infront of it whats that all about
2969749 i cant concentrate with you asking all these questions kid so can you just chill out for a few minutes
2969750 whats that supposed to mean where the hell are we
2969751 welcome to abruptus vacuo buddy dont suppose you remember who you are do you
2969752 i i dont remember anything whats going on am i dead
2969753 im afraid i cant answer all your questions buddy i just woke up here about an hour before you i was hoping you would pull through do you have a name
2969754 hey hey come on man dont cry well figure this shit out and in the mean time what do you want me to call you
2969755 you look like a nick to me hahaha you can make up a name for me until i figure out my real name
2969756 hey did you by any chance have a nightmare about a guy with a needle before you woke up thats the only thing i can remember is some guy coming at me in the dark with a needle
2969757 hmmmmm sounds spooky but i honestly dont remember anybody with a needle im afraid buddy anyway looks like were stuck here for a while take a look out there
2969758 it seems that way whoever or whatever it was that put us in here they obviously dont want us to leave
2969759 what the hell have you done chubb this will take hours to put back together
2969760 well do one of you wanna fill me in then
2969761 this is hooked up to a device that detects signal when an alarm goes off the alarm is transmitted from another machine most likely something from the av building
2969762 it comes from the aerial unit i remember when i was out there i was trying to get the attention of the cyborg but it couldnt see me but when the aerial unit was aware of my presence the cyborg started chasing me
2969763 the cyborgs are controlled from the aerial unit atleast i think they are because look at these
2969764 the cyborg can pick up sounds and the sounds it picks up must be transmitted back to the aerial unit
2969765 well thats just great shit they probably know about the entire plan now what the hell are we gonna do
2969766 we found this to it should tell you all you need to know
2969767 and we can hook it up to the tv monitor and see whats on it then we might beable to now what goes on inside their metal heads
2969768 how do you know how to do all this if you have no memory then how the hell do you know what youre doing
2969769 well to tell you the truth kid i dont know but let me put it like this do you remember how to read
2969770 well then before you came here you obviously knew how to read before i came here maybe i knew how to put things like this together thats the only explanation i have for ya son old memories creeping through thats all it is when i asked you about the tv monitor you knew what it was so maybe just maybe you had seen one before you came here
2969771 okay guys here we go someone better go and get some popcorn because its movie time hahaha

2969846 is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2969847 regime change is an american expression we do not use such an expression

2969856 your achievement today should inspire confidence amongst all indian sportspersons that they can achieve the pinnacle of any sport at the international level it should also be an inspiration for more of our youth to take up sports as a full time career
2969857 your achievement is even greater as not only has india won a gold medal at the olympic games after a very long gap of 28 years but also because you have become the first ever indian to win a gold medal at the olympics in an individual event
2969858 we will continue to support the agitation as long as it takes to get our demand for the restoration of land to shri amarnath shrine board fulfilled

2969864 not another security pundit talking at me about why i should do something i already do
2969865 you dont learn from mistakes if you think youre the exception
2969866 daniel perez was assassinated by jeremiah ordonez i walked into his house and shot him once in the chest with a shotgun i know where the shotgun is and who gave the order
2969867 were now into our fourth day and were very concerned
2969868 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2969869 it s nice for me too because at my age it s handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
2969870 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and i
2969871 my wife and i have traveled to reside in england
2969872 if i still have luck i would come back and die on thai soil like every other thai person
2969873 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2969874 world politics would be very different today were it not for winston churchill
2969875 victoria is a more interesting one she was not the most important figure of the victorian era but she was its greatest symbol
2969876 i think it is most astonishing that winston churchill has been omitted
2969877 i did lobby for wales i dont think you can talk about britishness without including wales

2969881 we were taken to the police holding facility and interrogated for several hours before we were deported
2969882 i feel good considering the calendar this year which was terrorizing its been a good year but a difficult one
2969883 if maybe i am a player who doesnt have any grand slams maybe a grand slam would still do more for my own career but because i have 12 already for me an olympic gold ranks high
2969884 honestly my olympic gold even though it was in doubles is my favorite trophy i have
2969885 it has been beyond my dreams to play the olympics
2969886 ive obviously experienced a lot in my 16 year career and i have to say friday night was probably the greatest night ive had professionally in my whole career
2969887 talk about being in the right place at the right time it was like wow
2969888 its great to play in a final against goran but its unfortunate it had to end on an injury its better for him to take care of his knee
2969889 i always get injured at the wrong time im getting older so i have to be careful now
2969890 we had one intent and that is to build the event
2969891 if i continue in this way i have a chance to be in the top 10 i dont know when if i am still beating andy roddick and top 10 players for sure i will be but you never know what may happen

2969900 durch die reduzierung der veranstaltungstage sollen bei der wm mindestens sieben entscheidungen pro abend zu sehen sein
2969901 dabei sollen die finals nicht mehr zur gleichen zeit entschieden werden
2969902 sie k nnten in den jeweiligen kontinenten und regionen oder drei tage vor einer wm stattfinden
2969903 dann w rden bei der wm nur noch halbfinals und finals ausgetragen
2969904 es ist eine politische entscheidung ob alle der 210 mitgliedsverb nde der iaaf mit mindestens einem athleten bei der wm dabei sind

2969912 das ist nicht m glich weil in diesem kalender nur die a l nderspiele oder die turniere der konf derationen oder die fifa turniere aufgef hrt sind
2969913 das k nnen wir nicht machen olympia m chte alles haben m chte die nationalmannchaften haben aber das k nnen wir nicht geben
2969914 es war es nie und wird es auch nie sein es wird nie eine zweite wm mit 16 mannschaften ist das sowieso nie m glich
