4070056 i had been with john for about three years he was a really nice guy and i enjoyed being with him but there wasnt a ton of passion most everyone we knew had gotten engaged and though john would have proposed in a second whenever he brought it up id change the subject i took a trip to australia for work and while i was gone i got together with a co worker to whom id always been insanely attracted i had a fantastic trip probably because for the first time in a long time i experienced that excitement id been missing i broke up with john soon after i returned home and began dating the guy from the trip even though im not super proud of my actions things ended up for the best after dating for a few years the guy from the trip and i got married and were incredibly happy together
4070057 right before i was going to break up with my ex sean he found out that he had to put his beloved dog to sleep he was so broken up about it that i didnt have the heart to end things so i waited a month or so until he was in better shape when things seemed to be better and i was ready he lost his job so i felt like i was back to square one by that time i had met someone else that i really wanted to start seeing so i went ahead and did it i eventually ended things never telling sean about my extra curricular dating i think i rationalized that i was trying to spare his feelings
4070058 my boyfriend greg and i decided to do the long distance thing after i was accepted to a graduate program 200 miles from where we lived the first few months were fine but i soon found myself becoming extremely attracted to my lab partner henry what began as innocent flirting eventually wound up with us in bed after the program was over i returned home to greg being with him was really difficult but i didnt break up with him initially because i was still attracted to him too i visited henry a few times and realized that he was really more of a fling probably born out of boredom and that greg was the one for me i eventually stopped communicating with henry i never told greg about what happened which occasionally makes me feel guilty but i chalk my cheating up to being young and silly he and i are still together four years since my program ended
4070059 i began dating eric shortly after i had been dumped by dave my boyfriend of two years i was devastated and eric was definitely a rebound thing after eric and i had dated for five months dave came back and wanted to give things another shot i still really missed him so i began seeing him but never ended things with eric i think i sort of kept eric around for insurance purposes just in case things didnt end up well with dave dave and i didnt make it on round two and after eric discovered through mutual friends that i had been seeing him again he ended things with me i definitely learned my lesson about dating two guys at the same time not to mention trying to rekindle a relationship thats just plain over
4070060 when i was younger i dated a guy named ethan who was really critical of me he constantly made little snide comments about my weight how stupid i was and how clumsy i was for whatever odd reason i was into him despite the fact that all of my friends and family hated him one weekend when he was away i met will at a party and we completely hit it off he was the complete opposite of ethan kind sweet and generous yet completely cool and fun too we hung out all weekend and it was like a light bulb went off in my head this is how mature relationship worthy guys act i hooked up with will the night before he left and broke up with ethan soon after will and i dated for three years and now were married
4070061 im from florida so i adore going to the beach and boating but my former boyfriend chris a total city boy hated it we always argued about where wed take trips and he always won about eight months into our dating i took a trip to key west with my friends and we chartered a boat for the day the captain of the boat was this totally hot complete beach guy for life type and i spent the whole day flirting with him we met him out that night and he and i got together i never told chris about it after i got home and i never felt guilty i think part of me felt like thats what chris got for being so stubborn chris and i didnt make it and after we broke up i made sure any future boyfriends loved the beach
4070062 my last boyfriend was a total player before we got together i thought i could change him but i was wrong i always heard rumors that he was hooking up with other girls while we were dating but he always denied it one night i got a call from a girl he had been seeing and she detailed their three month long relationship to me and told me about another girl she had discovered he was seeing as well i was so mad that i went out with my friends that night dressed to kill and went home with the hottest guy i could find i felt like it was the least he deserved i loved seeing the look on his face when i told him about what i did and that i knew about the other girls and then i dumped him
4070063 my ex was a terrible kisser the worst i really liked everything else about him but whenever it came time to get physical i just cringed one night when i was at a party without him a bunch of people started this old school yet fairly intense game of spin the bottle and i felt like i had to join as i hadnt had a decent kiss in a long time i probably kissed about 10 guys that night all of whom were so much better than my ex i ended things pretty quickly after that experience which made me realize that the physical part of a relationship is truly important

4070112 this project is near and dear to me because of what it stands for as the co founder of the aranmolate foundation for deformed children and a young man who strives to help the less fortunate when i read linda katzs letter i was touched and empowered by her resilience and it further affirms the reason why the foundation exists to be a resource to families such as the katzs
4070113 when linda exhausted her reasonable options she reached out to me in tears needing help to make her home more functional for her family i was immediately touched i just knew i had to help
4070114 when i worked as a kitchen designer i met an elderly women that needed to buy a toilet she was going into the hospital to have her leg amputated and needed to purchase a new toilet i visited her home to get a better idea of her needs and what a surprise she needed so much more than just a toilet it was then i realized people were in need of healing in their homes thru functional design and thus 24 7 project was born
4070115 toen het in de groepsfase zo goed ging kwamen er wel jongens naar me toe dat ik mijn beslissing moest heroverwegen dat ik moest doorgaan na die duels met itali en frankrijk ging dat wel even door mijn gedachten maar vervolgens gingen we eruit tegen rusland in de kwartfinale en had ik meteen iets van het is mooi geweest
4070116 weet ik niet ik bekijk het van jaar tot jaar maar ja zolang het goed gaat
4070117 als iedereen tevreden is ok maar als je wordt geconfronteerd met blessures en je mist lange periodes dan kijk je er anders tegenaan het ligt er dus aan speel ik nog een heel constant seizoen en gaat het goed of gaat het zo dat de club niet meer tevreden is in december kijk ik hoe ik ervoor sta dat is een mooi moment om te beslissen

4070124 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4070125 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4070126 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4070127 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4070128 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4070129 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4070136 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4070137 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4070138 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4070139 it was difficult for us to find the way to the goal
4070140 there were too many shots to the post the defence worked well the goalkeeper was good and only 22 goals against you should be enough
4070141 this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure
4070142 called me just 20 minutes before the bronze competition begging me to compete
4070143 i decided that i had come this far and didnt want to let them down so i wrestled
4070144 the 2014 soccer world cup is very very important its the basis for the success of our organization
4070145 we organized the best pan am games ever at the olympics level
4070146 this continent hasnt had the chance to organize the olympics and paralympic games now its time were ready now its the moment
4070147 we are still a society with inequalities and the olympic games will help to reduce that
4070148 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4070149 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4070151 the sudanese yuriy and kamel have run 1 42s this season and i think that is pretty good
4070152 the race will be competitive and the winner may be the runner who controls the mind games better
4070153 the olympics are tricky mental toughness is important the race is not won by the best time or how strong an athlete is but how relaxed one is how well one executes his judgment
4070154 you make the right decision at the right time and you win you make a slight mistake and you are cooked and mistakes dont win medals
4070155 i lost the gold in sydney when i was at my best because of those simple mistakes
4070156 i was confident but my judgment was not right when an athlete kicks is paramount to his winning the race
4070157 not really but i have always believed that if you never give up a good result will follow i am glad it worked out well
4070158 i was in a very bad situation i thought i wont be able to get a medal but after that i tried to talk to myself to perform as always
4070159 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4070160 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4070161 it is factually incorrect to term all the people in the camps in eastern nepal bhutanese bhutan cannot accept a blanket reference to all the people in the camps as being refugees from bhutan
4070162 the lack of a screening procedure when the camps were first established in 1991 allowed persons of all antecedents to congregate in the camps the camps were opened by the government of nepal which sought unhcr un refugee agency assistance in 1991 when there were only 304 people claiming to be bhutanese refugees
4070163 it is a highly complex issue with its genesis in illegal immigration in a region marked by vast population movements porous and open borders poverty environmental degradation and political instability
4070164 bhutan stands committed to finding a durable solution to the problem of the people in the camps in keeping with the agreements reached with the government of nepal
4070165 there is so much frustration among refugees that they have started to fight between themselves
4070166 participants in the expert consultation in december 2007 described how in 1985 the citizenship law of bhutan stripped an estimated 100 000 individuals of ethnic nepali origin of their citizenship rights a factor leading to their forced expulsion from the country
4070167 according to the participants the bhutanese of nepali ethnic origin are allegedly prevented from returning to their own country denied the right to a nationality in their country of residence and are de facto stateless those remaining in bhutan are also denied citizenship and consequently continue to live in a precarious legal limbo and fear similar expulsion from the country
4070168 disappointed with the selective and simplistic reproduction in the report of the independent expert of assertions that emerged during the so called expert consultations of december 2007 of which the royal government was neither aware nor invited to participate in references to bhutan contained in paragraph 58 of that report were regrettably rife with factual inaccuracies and fell far short of the minimum standard of objectivity expected of united nations reports

4070178 cardiovascular diseases is britains number one killer therefore it is of public interest that nice initiates a review of this guidance there is important new evidence available particularly in the area of stroke which means that the existing guidance needs to be re assessed we now have the opportunity to ensure the guidance is kept up to date and in line with new evidence
4070179 the review of tag90 announced by nice today is timely the current guidance looks at patients in isolation for example patients who have only had a stroke or patients who have only had peripheral arterial disease pad however according to the reach registry the largest registry of 68 000 patients with cardiovascular disease around the world one in six of these patients have multivascular disease and are at even higher risk of further events heart attack stroke hospitalisation these multivascular patients are currently overlooked in the guidance we look forward to participating in this review with nice as it gives us the opportunity to ensure these patients treatment needs are addressed and that they are offered the most effective treatments
4070180 we believe that a pay offer of 4 95 per cent is very competitive especially when compared with the uk average rise of 3 7 per cent
4070181 we are disappointed the rmt is taking this stance and passengers have every right to feel angry over the proposed action
4070182 there are differences between our offer and metronets deal they are in the third year of an agreement but the metronet pay is not substantially more than what we are offering
4070183 the rmts vote against the offer and the length of their proposed action defy reason and perhaps suggests there is an ulterior motive behind the rejection they have made no secret of their desire for tube maintenance to return to public ownership
4070184 rmt members on tube lines do the same work as colleagues on metronet and they have made it clear they are not prepared to be left worse off
4070185 our members are facing the reality of a five per cent inflation rate and soaring energy and food bills and if tube lines wants to avoid a crippling strike it should get back around the table with an offer that meets their needs
4070186 its too early to say exactly how things will work out
4070187 not everyone will be on strike so well see what happens

4070242 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4070243 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4070244 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4070245 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4070246 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4070262 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
4070263 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
4070264 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
4070265 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
4070266 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
4070267 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of arsenal
4070268 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
4070269 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half

4070276 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4070277 for certain events the most important thing is to learn the result instantly
4070278 thats exactly the case with mobile tv and the olympics
4070279 tv will become a standard feature for cellphones in china by the end of this year just like cameras
4070280 the original plan was to distribute the phones after the games
4070281 however china mobile decided to do it before the games kicked off because they think the development of mobile tv technology has already reached a satisfactory level
4070282 nowadays peoples attention and time is segmented so they want multi functional converged handsets
4070283 so copying tv content to mobile phones is attractive to many people
4070284 if you have a boom people will have money to spend so you have customers
4070285 when you have a downturn you have more customers because they have nothing to do
4070286 it is definitely only a problem for the us and canadian markets
4070287 in this situation bmw recommends customers not to use the front passenger seat and have the vehicle serviced immediately at the present time we are unaware of any accidents or injuries as a result of this issue

4070299 while criminal activity in the workplace can never be condoned the tuc is concerned that this register could lead to people being excluded from the job market by an employer who falsely accuses them of misconduct or sacks them because they bear them a grudge
4070300 i do expect that many of the current negotiations will be translated into new members
4070301 the employer reporting data to the register should be sure that there will be an adverse effect between what the individual has done and their employment in a similar capacity in other words does it render them unsuitable for employment dishonesty theft fraud etc are all obvious factors which may be relevant
4070302 if the employer is at risk this is entirely valid

4070309 a unified streamlined system to respond to the enormous challenge presented by so many young and not so young men and women returning from war in desperate need of assistance
4070310 it would be very difficult to pull this information together
4070311 brendas last published study using this data set was released in 2000 after she moved to her present facility in 1995
4070312 immediately after that publication one of my colleagues requested a break down of details which had only been superficially summarized in one her tables one of her grad students replied on her behalf with the additional summary statistics we had requested within 48 hours so it clearly wasnt at all difficult for her team to access the data plus with modern electronic data bases and multiple backup procedures in place at universities like hers it is nearly impossible to lose such data
4070313 i know of a number of experts in the field who have requested the data even within the last six months but she simply doesnt respond to their calls emails or letters
4070314 this is very troubling on two counts first it the apas own ethics rule 8 14 requires research psychologists to share their data for verification of findings secondly she is the chair of the apa abortion task force which is at least in theory supposed to bring full and clear light to this issue but how can we trust the objectivity of a report prepared by a task force composed exclusively of pro choice psychologists especially when the chair and lead author has a history of withholding data and findings which may undermine her ideological preferences
4070315 there is no doubt that she has selectively reported her findings
4070316 in my view it is irresponsible not to report the significant findings associated with individual symptoms for example she found that a number of women reported that they tried to cope with negative feelings about their abortions by drinking more or taking drugs but she has never not fully shared the details on these reactions in any of her published studies and by refusing to share her data for reanalysis by others she has prevented anyone else from reporting these findings either
4070317 even the modifier that there is no credible evidence of mental health risks in the ideal case of a low risk abortion patient is an admission that there is indeed some evidence that a single abortion can pose a risk to the mental health of a emotionally stable adult woman
4070318 in fact the report itself identifies a whole host of studies providing such evidence but it mutes a clear presentation of the findings of these studies by focusing on the limitations of each studys methodology which all studies have in order to justify ignoring their clear implications
4070319 by failing to call on therapists to be alert and sensitive to the negative emotional experiences women attribute to their abortions the task force has allowed ideology to trump sensitivity
4070320 instead they are ignoring the reality of how and why abortions take place and are instead focused on drawing conclusions regarding the safety of abortion for an emotionally stable pro choice adult woman who is freely choosing a wanted abortion without any moral qualms but that doesnt reflect the reality of most abortion situations
4070321 the fact is that coerced abortions are more common than wanted abortions studies show that over 60 of american women are having abortions often against their moral beliefs because they feel pressured into it by third parties these women need therapist and family members to be open to and responsive to their pain not dismissive of it as an anomaly sadly this is an ideological report that simply ignores the concerns and needs of those women for whom abortion has been a heartache rather than a triumph

4070330 this new offset credit banking facility enables foreign industry and their indian offset partner to have long term arrangements to discharge offsets and will thus enhance the capacity of the indian industry to absorb offsets
4070331 perhaps the most significant aspect of the new dpp that provides the opportunity to a foreign vendor to partner with the indian industry and more importantly facilitates them to do business with the private sector
4070332 we have learned a lot of lessons from the past and we dont want to repeat the mistakes that is why every now and then we are trying to improve the defense procurement policies
4070333 we are very clear that we will not allow middlemen in defense deals
4070334 partnering with indian vendors would become faster and easier for foreign vendors
4070335 armed forces all over the world are in a process of speedy modernization and restructuring
4070336 and india cannot lag behind in this trend we want a highly modern armed force and we need to do that fast
4070337 the bad part of this dpp is that it hasnt addressed the foreign direct investment issue
4070338 during the quarter we have made significant progress on several management and operational areas important to restarting mining concentrate production and shipping submission of our draft plans marked a major step forward in the approval process in the current third quarter we received responses to these plans from all relevant government agencies and the incorporation of these comments into our plans is almost complete this will allow final plans to be submitted to the minister in compliance with his requirement for us to meet his stringent conditions for his formal approval to allow shipping of our product through fremantle we are confident our plans which have been subjected to extensive review comment and consultation will meet the ministers expectations good progress was also made in formalizing our commitment to contribute to esperance and the lead related clean up in order to allow the community to move forward from the events of 2007
4070339 we recognize it has been a long process but our future method of shipment is completely different and requires substantial review planning and high level approval we believe we are on the home stretch and every effort is being made to complete this in the most efficient and timely manner

4070464 pico d is an exceptionally smart looking product but after you carry it in your pocket and use it for a while you realize that theres much more to it than handsome looks very few other usb drives can measure up to the pico d in features performance and quality
4070465 our engineers and manufacturing people fussed over minute details for months before we took pico d to production so the finished drive has an unmatched feel of quality to it
4070466 we are fielding a relatively young side with a lot of our new players included

4070484 it is clear that the air force is busy collapsing apart from the concern about the pilots the true crisis is the huge number of technicians which have been lost without technicians airplanes can not be maintained or flown
4070485 this situation makes south africa vulnerable against other african countries such as zimbabwe
4070486 minister lekota acknowledges in his reply that poor salaries and the perception that whites have restricted career opportunities in the air force are some of the main reasons as to why members of the air force are leaving the freedom front plus has warned lekota since 2005 that affirmative action and a restricted budget will lead to the air force collapsing lekota is now reaping what he sowed

4070489 i was at a league managers association meeting down in london on tuesday so i had to go down quite early therefore i didnt get a chance to speak to gareth which i would have done
4070490 john robertson and steve walford spoke to him just after training he was ready willing and able to play which is great
4070491 last week i think he felt that the liverpool move was going to take place now we dont know whats happening so dont think anybody is in any sort of triumphalist mood but he wants to play and that is exceptionally good news
4070492 were an ambitious club and were not going to get anywhere by selling our best players
4070493 we dont need to sell them and theyre not for sale so in the nicest possible way naff off
4070494 weve sold players but that was because mick mccarthy felt they didnt fit into his plans going forward
4070495 as people know i do try to keep a low profile because i leave the talking to mick and the lads on the pitch and anything on the commercial side to jez
4070496 at the time i just felt there was too much speculation and a lot of it unfounded and stories being invented in the press that i wanted to say something
4070497 there were a number of managers and scouts coming to look at our players and the message i wanted to get out was quite simple
4070498 its great to see kights back and indeed to see all of the new players as well as the existing ones theres a good feeling about the squad and im very excited

4070502 no supondr menos garant as medioambientales y se seguir exigiendo las mismas condiciones que hasta el momento
4070503 la mejora de la eficiencia de la tramitaci n ambiental tendr una repercusi n econ mica tremenda ya que afecta a pr cticamente todas las infraestructuras del pa s e inversiones industriales importantes
4070504 pensemos que podemos estar hablando de tener colgados en la red 2 000 3 000 proyectos pero a lo mejor uno de ellos es un tramo del ave o de un gasoducto
4070505 el objetivo principal es acelerar la tramitaci n lo m ximo posible para no frenar las inversiones ya que hoy en d a conllevan

4070507 la evaluaci n de impacto ambiental va a perder sentido y credibilidad
4070508 la evaluaci n de impacto ambiental es el nico sistema que permite analizar y garantizar que los proyectos no vayan a tener unos impactos ambientales elevados agilizar este proceso equivale a convertirlos en un mero tr mite que hay que hacer lo m s r pido posible no es una decisi n pol tica que se pueda hacer en un d a el estudio de impacto ambiental necesita un tiempo y una valoraci n basada en criterios t cnicos no pol ticos la sensaci n que da la ministra es que quiere agilizar los tr mites lo m s r pido posible para dar salida a muchas obras que posiblemente est n paradas por tener una evaluaci n de impacto negativa los proyectos se tienen que someter a un proceso para ver si son o no viables
4070509 si el proceso se tramita con prisas pondr en duda el sentido y la credibilidad de las declaraciones de impacto ambiental hacerlo m s r pido quiere decir que se haga con menos control con menos cuidado lo que puede implicar que salgan declaraciones positivas en proyectos que tengan unos impactos ambientales importantes consideramos que es algo inadmisible y muy grave por parte del gobierno estas medidas no tienen ning n sentido de cara a la crisis nuestro pa s est a la cabeza de europa en n mero de autopistas y autov as por habitante y se est n construyendo proyectos de carreteras que son innecesarios se est n saltando estos criterios de necesidad para poner en marcha proyectos que muchas veces no son necesarios y que tienen impactos ambientales muy importantes
4070510 el medio ambiente se convierte en una v ctima m s de la crisis econ mica
4070511 esta decisi n est n demostrando que la pol tica medio ambiental se interpreta como un obst culo al crecimiento econ mico los estudios de impacto ambiental son un tr mite fundamental para salvaguardar los valores naturales presentes en nuestro territorio rechazamos la forma en que se est haciendo todo estamos en agosto cuando m s gente est de vacaciones para evitar discusi n donde no hay discusiones ni debates ni es el momento ni es la forma para una propuesta de este calibre est claro que el objetivo de esta medida es reducir los criterios ambientales de los proyectos con lo que desde greenpeace somos muy cr ticos con esta acci n convierte al medio ambiente en una v ctima m s de la crisis econ mica de esta manera se va a forzar cualquier decisi n por encima de cualquier entorno medio ambiental o espacio natural y encima no esconde ni el prop sito es una aut ntica traici n del gobierno a su programa electoral
4070512 cuando paga el medio ambiente tambi n paga nuestra econom a
4070513 nos parece una medida que no va a ayudar a la situaci n econ mica de nuestro pa s y va a poner en cuesti n todo lo que es la normativa de protecci n de medio ambiente que debe ir acompa ando a cualquier obra p blica no entiendo hasta qu punto la relajaci n de las medidas establecidas para las declaraciones de impacto ambiental pueden ayudar a solventar una crisis tan grave como la que tiene nuestro pa s ahora resulta que los responsables del par n econ mico son los requisitos que se exigen para las declaraciones de impacto ambiental de las obras p blicas considero que esta medida es una manifestaci n m s de un gobierno despistado absolutamente desorientado que est intentado sacar de una crisis muy profunda de nuestro pa s a base de ocurrencias y no de una pol tica global que es la que requiere este momento
4070514 a zapatero ya se le puede quitar la chapa de la lucha contra el cambio clim tico uno de sus grandes objetivos de su programa electoral el tema medioambiental s lo lo trata como marketing tenemos que tener claro que cuando paga el medio ambiente tambi n paga nuestra econom a nuestro medio ambiente es una etiqueta para el resto del mundo como pa s tur stico que es espa a el poner en cuesti n el valor de nuestro patrimonio cultural repercute negativamente en nuestra econom a con todo nos parece muy desacertado lo que est haciendo este gobierno

4070527 brazils central bank believes that it has underestimated the strength of its economy and has moved its previous forecast of 4 5 per cent gdp growth for 2008 up to 4 8 per cent
4070528 having studied figures just released which show brazils current gdp to be 749 billion in 2007 up 5 4 per cent on 2006 the official number crunchers decided that theyd been too cautious brazil does seem to be resilient to the turbulence in the northern half of the americas a turbulence which has sent shockwaves across europe and while the spanish property market is currently down on its luck brazil has the very same to thank for making a major contribution to its current fortune
4070529 judging by the figures from its sister resort pousada dos girassois in pipa which enjoys 80 per cent occupancy per year you could stand to make a lot more
4070530 girassois is one of the most successful developments in pipa and the value of property for sale in pipa has doubled in just two years
4070531 the property market in natal is in its relative infancy and the coastline is almost development free supply currently lags way below demand
4070532 new development is springing up alongside sporting and leisure facilities but the authorities are paying great attention to the environment before granting licenses aesthetics and stability are of greater importance to them than squeezing every last penny out of every last square metre
4070533 prices of property for sale in natal are incredibly low right now but outside investment in infrastructure such as golf courses and a new airport will increase demand for property and inevitably trigger natural price hikes
4070534 being the closest part of brazil to europe thus drastically cutting down flying times to between seven and nine hours from most european cities natal has phenomenal beaches a permanent summer and with year round rental potential suits both audiences the pure investor and the holiday home hunter
4070535 the investment in the general infrastructure and tourism in the north east of brazil has been significant over the past few years and is set to continue for the foreseeable future
4070536 the government is committed to developing the area and with the new airport just a couple of years away we feel that property in the natal area and along this coastline of brazil offer some of the most exciting investment opportunities we have seen in a long time

4070556 in a biological context when two rather similar species i e energy transduction mechanisms compete for the same source of energy e g food the one with even slightly more effective mechanisms e g claws teeth feet etc captures more than the other
4070557 gradually the population of the more effective species will increase at the expense of the other
4070558 let us assume that a mutation happens to improve the speed of a cheetah
4070559 consequently this cheetah will catch more food i e more energy will channel through this individual the path has become steeper likewise a deleterious mutation will reduce the flow via the particular path that has turned less steep in this case the non mutated paths are the healthy rivalries and will enjoy correspondingly larger flows due to the diminished competition
4070560 a system evolves to reach a stationary state with respect to its surroundings
4070561 that is to say when the surrounding environment is high in energy then the system will evolve to a high energy stationary state matter on earth has evolved over eons in increasing its energy content to match that of the solar radiation density during this process mechanisms of energy transduction have improved but presumably there are still ways to catch more of the sunlight to power activities that are presently fueled by non renewables

4070702 the inspector has said that the energy policy outweighs the landscape at the same time the government is telling us our future economy is based on tourism
4070703 they are trying to tick so many policy boxes but they are in direct conflict with one another
4070704 what this decision does is open up the entire landscape and increases its market value because some people who own farms will see this as a licence to print money
4070705 what is disturbing is that the permission for middlemoor has now been submitted as a core document in favour of a wind farm application in tynedale this could also prove to be a green light to justify other applications such as wandylaw
4070706 a political decision has been taken where the landscape impact has been practically ignored and the whole area is going to be blighted
4070707 its bad news for tourism and all those local businesses which have expanded to support the visitor industry
4070708 the buck has effectively been passed to the ministry of defence which made it clear at the inquiry that unless the laws of physics can be changed you cannot put turbines this close to a radar station
4070709 the objections are nimbyism at its worst we need an alternative energy provider soon
4070710 catss will attend the public inquiry and will present evidence objecting to the erection of wind turbines at shipdham by which time this process will have been ongoing for seven years
4070711 we are very surprised because we thought the historical setting and the impact of the turbines on the landscape would have been sufficient for it to be refused
4070712 it seems the planning inspector has completely missed the point the turbines will be clearly visible from beauty spots such as bamburgh newton by the sea and ros castle but the inspector doesnt seem to have grasped that
4070713 renewable energy technologies such as wind are essential to cutting uk carbon emissions and given our excellent resources the uk can become a world leader securing our energy supply and creating many thousands of new uk jobs
4070714 of course we will continue to work with local communities and are committed to substantial efforts to protect and where possible enhance the environment
4070715 we are delighted that john hutton and malcolm wicks have decided that we can construct and operate the middlemoor windfarm
4070716 the renewable energy background to the proposal is so strong and the potential benefits so great that the harm identified to visual aspects and the settings should not prevent the proposal from proceeding
4070717 the cumulative effect of the middlemoor wind farm were the wandylaw scheme already in place would be to increase the harm arising in both these spheres compared to that arising from the middlemoor development on its own
4070718 nevertheless i consider it still insufficient to halt the proposal although serious consideration should be given to regrouping the schemes array of turbines into clearly separated blocks to lessen the impact
4070719 what seems remarkable to me is that the inspector almost seems to be giving a decision on wandylaw as well
4070720 its particularly galling that the decision comes at this time just as we are preparing our proofs for the wandylaw inquiry which have to be submitted by the end of next week

4070727 enhancing the participation of speaker of the house of representatives hon dimeji bankole the disadvantaged groups in university education in nigeria
4070728 permit me to observe that in our society there seems to be a poor appreciation of the economics of distance learning in this non formal type of delivery enrolment figures are often not the issue because they could be as elastic as prevailing realities dictate
4070729 in order to complement the need to solve the problems of access for the disadvantaged groups government needs to adequately fund not only the formal public universities but also the national open university of nigeria
4070730 against the background of the cold reality which our experience with the joint admission and matriculation board jabm has shown we must look beyond the four walls of university education
4070731 in this era of ict we also need to facilitate the emergence of intellectual platforms to enable educational institutions to collaborate and share facilities and resources
4070732 other challenges include the imperative to balance the contending factors of cost quality easy access and public perception of the certificates issued on graduation
4070733 the bushmen of nigeria who have no basic education have not gotten a hope of university education too
4070734 planning application number 05 2008 8885 land adjacent to brightenber hill bd23 3pa
4070735 this new breed of teachers will be the forebearers of the inclusion educators
4070736 if the federal government had offered necessary focused and sincere leadership the teacdhers strike that shut down the nation witnessed in recent times was preventable or would not have lasted for so long on the contrary the federal government chieftains subjected critical issue of education to the unhelpful academic politics of the federation any federation rests on minimum standards on critical indispensable issues like education health labour pay etc
4070737 rather self defender of untenable position that worsens a crisis
4070738 the lesson for the future is that mr president and his ministers must live up to their promises of service delivery in education sector it is remarkable that where the federal government woefully failed the governors forum has tried to resolve the matter with the recent agreement reached with teachers
4070739 regardless of the details of the agreement what is clear and commendable was allowing the spirit of collective bargaining and social dialogue to work thereby putting an end to the unnecessary crisis the lesson in this is that never again should we allow our schools to close for one day talkless of the 4 weeks closure witnessed in the recent time

4070742 i think it will be dangerous people driving on the motorway will be distracted and they are approaching one of the most dangerous flyovers in the country do we want to put this in their line of vision
4070743 what we are very concerned about the fact that residents who live over looking this field have not been notified
4070744 people living in red house lane and the hill have a right to be told about this
4070745 as part of the planning application process the council has statutory obligations to fulfil when consulting with the public and often exceeds these
4070746 in this case the council has met all its requirements including notifying the local parish council erecting a sign nearby and contacting the resident who lives adjacent to the proposed location
4070747 i believe the blimp along with the photo montages produced of how the turbines would look on coldingham moor were not accurate and misleading they have caused confusion and mispresent how the windfarm would appear
4070748 my view is the windfarm would cause an adverse effect is not neccessarily an unacceptable one you will be able to see 22 turbines from the a1107 and the impact will be significant i have never denied that
4070749 nearly all windfarms in scotland have an adverse effect i believe this site has a good capacity as a simple moor of large scale that inherent scale makes it capable of absorbing substantial change
4070750 we think siting is the only issue that the county need address
4070751 this can be accomplished easily by regulating the tower only which is a structure that the county has authority to regulate
4070752 people do not need or want the county to make us safe from ourselves on our own property
4070753 i am not against good use of taxpayers money and i am not against the dental clinic
4070754 i think we should have a written contract and a time table for payment as well as a line item so we know when it has been paid back we need a record
4070755 i want to go on record that my vote was not against the dental clinic

4070858 this general evenness and smoothness of sedimentary layers throughout the geologic column is rather odd especially considering the fact that the current weathering rate for the continents of today averages about 6cm thousand years for the continental shelves this means that in less than 10 million years the entire continental shelves of today would be washed into the oceans to be replaced by new underlying materials

4071256 recently a report was published by dr richard cravatts of boston university who analyzed the results of a survey on the worlds most hated countries the survey which was administered on college campuses around the globe revealed that israel is
4071257 theyre going to start having relationships with them or at least those with intimacy issues
4071258 i feel the need to stay away from a discussion of specific cases
4071259 so while im happy to talk about stare decisis and the importance of precedent i dont think i should get into the application of those principles in a particular area
4071260 i do feel compelled to point out that i should not agree or disagree with particular decisions and im reluctant to do that thats one of the areas where i think prior nominees have drawn the line when it comes to do you agree with this case or do you agree with that case and thats something that im going to have to draw the line in the sand
4071261 well i think that gets to the application of the principles in a particular case and based on my review of the prior transcripts of every nominee sitting on the court today thats where theyve generally declined to answer when it gets to the application of legal principles to particular cases
4071262 well again i think i should stay away from discussions of particular issues that are likely to come before the court again
4071263 what im saying is that that issue or issues related to that could well come before the court and thats why i have to resist answering a particular hypothetical question
4071264 senator thats a question that i dont think can be answered in the abstract you need to know the particular circumstances and exactly what the facts are and what the legislation would be like because the argument on the other side and as a judge i would obviously be in a position of considering both arguments the argument for the legislature and the argument for the executive
4071265 again i dont want to express conclusions on hypothetical questions whether as applied in a particular case where there would be a challenge in that respect those cases come up all the time and i do need to avoid expressing an opinion on those issues
4071266 and i dont know what arguments parties will be raising in those cases so an abstract question you need to know obviously whats the claim whats the issue and decide it according to the rule of law
4071267 and since those questions might well come before the court i do need to exercise caution on that
4071268 well that is in an area where i think i should not respond
4071269 let me explain very briefly why its because if these questions come before me either on the court on which i now sit or if i am confirmed on the supreme court i need to decide those questions with an open mind on the basis of the arguments presented on the basis of the record presented in the case and on the basis of the rule of law including the precedents of the court not on the basis of any commitments during the confirmation process
4071270 senator my answer is that the independence and integrity of the supreme court requires that nominees before this committee for a position on that court not forecast give predictions give hints about how they might rule in cases
4071271 well i dont want to comment on any particular case but i think i can speak more generally about the approach
4071272 i think nominees have to draw the line where theyre comfortable
4071273 while im happy to talk about stare decisis and the importance of precedent i dont think i should get into the application of those principles in a particular area
4071274 id have to consider all those before reaching a conclusion in any of those particular areas
4071275 and so thats an area that i do not feel it appropriate for me to comment on
4071276 well again and of course without getting into the particulars
4071277 and i dont think that i should go further to elaborate upon whether or not it applies in those particular situations
4071278 but in terms of a separate determination on my part whether this decision is correct or that decision is correct my review of what other nominees have done is that thats where they draw the line and thats where ive drawn the line
4071279 but i dont think its appropriate for me given the fact that cases arise on both of those questions to go further
4071280 those are issues that come up again and again before the court and consistent with what i understand the approach to have been of other nominees i dont think i should express a view on that
4071281 well senator that is exactly one of the questions that is before the court and i cannot answer that in the abstract an abstract opinion that would prejudge that case would be inappropriate for a nominee to express

4071294 acid rain is one of several pollution problems in asia that need solving in the coming decades but we need to appreciate the potential consequences of that clean up one of which could be an increase in methane emissions as the effect of the acid rain wears off
4071295 we had similar results when exposing natural wetlands to simulated acid rain but this could be more important since natural wetlands are mostly located far from major pollution sources whereas for rice agriculture the methane source and the largest source of acid rain are both in the same region asia
4071296 this might paradoxically have the effect of reducing a source of food for the methane producing microorganisms that live in the soil
4071297 there is also likely to be competition between these microorganism and sulphate reducing bacteria normally in these conditions sulphate reducers win which results in less methane
4071298 our paper clearly shows that wildlife has been affected by climate change over the last 25 years some nature reserves in southern britain now have an almost mediterranean feel to them
4071299 many scientists have used models to predict the future changes in distribution of species responding to climate change but our paper shows that wildlife has been responding to a changing climate for a quarter of a century at least
4071300 this discovery has profound consequences for some of our most threatened and declining wildlife and shows that climate change is likely to continue to have an overwhelming impact on the threatened species

4071366 it allows you to go out faster and go out longer
4071367 the public has a right to be suspicious of doping
4071368 theyre swimming a little more aggressively taking a risk a little bit and finding out they can maybe do a little bit more than normal
4071369 the thing that i think has changed so dramatically is that peoples expectations are just higher of whats possible

4071392 the world is the devils hunting ground and children are his choicest game
4071393 the marvel of marvels is not that god in his infinite love has not elected
4071394 to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards out of men
4071395 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available
4071396 a lot of these young people are not married or in relationships so we want to make sure they have the information and tools to protect themselves if they have sexual encounters
4071397 a blog where you can have an opinion not get one
4071398 there is much to work on over the next two days but importantly a win was achieved and qualification for the group phase is in their own hands
4071399 well it was because he had to play with that guy

4071416 el roscograma se refiere a que el procurador nombra a los familiares de la corte la fiscal a nombra a los de la corte los de la corte nombran a los directores de fiscal a el clientelismo judicial que es evidente y claro
4071417 no s lo atento sino ansioso de acudir a un llamado de un juez o un fiscal ecuatoriano en el proceso que quieran promover por injuria o calumnia
4071418 ahora como se ha vuelto habitual o costumbre cada vez que le abrimos investigaci n a alguien y tenemos que absolver unas dudas resultan denunciando a los fiscales a los jueces e incluso al fiscal general
4071419 el presidente est buscando o que me maten o que me yo me tenga que ir del pa s y del pa s no me voy a ir la responsabilidad sobre mi seguridad y sobre mi vida le corresponde al presidente

4071428 the structures of the compounds made by electric discharge differ from those formed by uv photolysis so the hydrolysis time could be very different some of the photochemical products when uv light is used are hydrocarbons that do not react with water
4071429 was meant to mimic charged particle interactions which ferris admits is a process at work on titan
4071430 uv light radiation produces tholins that look more like titans haze
4071431 some if not most of the products we make also dont react with water
4071432 tholins formed at low pressure seem to look more like titans haze than those formed at higher pressures you can make tholins at low pressures using uv light you cannot make tholins at low pressure using plasma discharge and to make the amount of tholins we needed for the experiment we needed to use the discharge technique uv photolysis only produces small amounts

4071441 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries across the oceans across the mountains across the prairies because we are made of sugar candy
4071442 in 1979 a large passenger jet with 257 people on board left new zealand for a sightseeing flight to antarctica and back unknown to the pilots however someone had modified the flight coordinates by a mere two degrees this error placed the aircraft 28 miles 45 km to the east of where the pilots assumed they were as they approached antarctica the pilots descended to a lower altitude to give the passengers a better look at the landscape although both were experienced pilots neither had made this particular flight before and they had no way of knowing that the incorrect coordinates had placed them directly in the path of mount erebus an active volcano that rises from the frozen landscape to a height of more than 12 000 feet 3 700 m as the pilots flew onward the white of the snow and ice covering the volcano blended with the white of the clouds above making it appear as though they were flying over flat ground by the time the instruments sounded the warning that the ground was rising fast toward them it was too late the airplane crashed into the side of the volcano killing everyone on board it was a terrible tragedy brought on by a minor error a matter of only a few degrees

4071453 i understand they have put puryear in the controversial category
4071454 its very rare for a district court nominee to become controversial usually they just fly through
4071455 groups can attack a nominee but youll never see the nominee respond to anything except at hearings
4071456 as far as his qualifications go he was at the top of his class in law school he clerked on the u s court of appeals he has legislative experience in the u s senate he manages litigation for a big fortune 500 company and the aba american bar association rated him as qualified
4071457 gus realizes this is a lame duck year in politics
4071458 its true for all nominees whether youre in the deal or not is beyond your control
4071459 at the end of the session its who wants a bridge in vermont

4071461 kami melaporkan incumbent calon bupati h aang ke kpk karena merasa tindakannya sudah melebihi batas tidak lagi memerhatikan kepentingan kepentingan desa dengan tidak mencairkan add termin ke dua sebagaimana mestinya pencairan yang dilakukan kabag keuangan hanya 20 persen padahal seharusnya dicairkan seuruhnya
4071462 sisa add yang seharusnya dicairkan 2 agustus kemarin seluruhnya tidak dilakukan dengan alasan pemkab tidak ada dana namun setelah saya selidiki add digunakan untuk pembuatan spanduk baliho dan stiker kampanye calon bupati cabub jelas hal itu merupakan penyelewengan anggaran sehingga kami secara kolektif melakukan laporan ke kpk
4071463 if the fsa adopted limits on speculation you would see the price of gasoline drop in the united kingdom

4071465 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf

4071467 you have to be there it is a major sales event it is advertising
4071468 you want to be there to be a conduit for information because clearly we have controversial issues in canada and the last thing that we want to be is shy we stand behind our technology
4071469 what we need now is an objective discussion and accountability and this doesnt seem to be creating the proper context for what needs to be a very frank and open debate
4071470 it is our intention to show at trial that mr nugent caused the death of baron pikes by tasing him multiple times unnecessarily and in violation of louisiana law and by failing to get him medical attention when it was apparent he needed it

4071487 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4071488 nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4071489 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
4071490 as asian pacific americans support u s olympic athletes some of whom are asian american it is disturbing to oca that spains basketball team would introduce such divisive imagery into the olympics
4071491 if they havent realized their mistake yet they probably will hear about it when the nba season comes back around
4071492 it was a gesture of affection and identification with the chinese people
4071493 ultimately there is a very good relationship between the chinese and spanish governments and there is no kind of conflict at all between the two peoples

4071506 we believe that he is the best man for ghana out of all the ministers we have had under this present government it is very clear that major courage quashigah has excelled in terms of honesty discipline and foresight he is liked by all ghanaians
4071507 it is time for ghanaians to eschew certain cultural and historical habits we elect people based on tribe and political affiliation ghana belongs to all of us it does not belong to any tribe political party or religion for that matter if we are to vote we have to look at the competence of the person his fairness and honesty we are advocating that he goes as an independent candidate
4071508 in ghana you and i agree that there is a lot of favoritism whom you know and all that this man has been able to stand out we have credible people who can run this country better but because of political parties and their memberships they have not been able to contribute meaningfully to the development of the country
4071509 we do not think it is an issue it is a matter of principle that if he indeed thinks what we are saying is true then he must listen to us as we all know he always listens to the masses
4071510 it would not be the first time a minister would be renouncing his party to contest as an independent candidate
4071511 we have sent a copy of our findings to him he is currently going through and we are very confident that he will respond in the affirmative

4071539 what happens is that every minimum wage law raises the lowliest jobs on the lowest rung of the ladder higher and higher until for some people the poorest of the poor the least educated and the least skilled cant jump high enough to grab that lowest rung what the congresscreeps have done in the name of compassion and fairness is to raise the bar of opportunity to a height where it cant be reached the fair caring sensitive compassionate progressive and socially responsible congresscretins have always known the results of their actions if raising the minimum wage actually works why stop at 70 cents why not go for two bucks or 20 or 50
4071540 the notoriety that was brought to bear on one particular juror whose name and background have been widely publicized in the media

4071575 but we know god knows what is best thats why he put you to rest
4071576 you dont need red bull to give you wings you have your own now
4071577 remember me the way i was and love me the way i am
4071578 the horses trotted well today they all look healthy and fit and happy were looking forward to starting the process tomorrow
4071579 kirks horse had arguably been our first or second horse until recently so while losing daniels experience was a blow by bringing kirk back in we dont lose a lot
4071580 daniel is a fantastically experienced rider kirk is not so experienced but has been there at crucial times in the past couple of years for new zealand and performed very credibly
4071581 so i think the net effect on the quality of this team is not a very big effect at all
4071582 these guys are seasoned competitors and although katie hasnt spent as much time outside of new zealand as the rest of them shes ridden on an awful lot of teams competitions and feels pretty comfortable being part of the team
4071583 shes going to be our no 1 rider shes going out first i have a lot of respect for her and feel very comfortable sending her out in that trailblazing role
4071584 but i am confident of our build up bruce won a grand prix just before coming into quarantine and sharn has had some very strong results in the us
4071585 katie has been the one that has struggled the most of recent and i attribute that to the travel and acclimatisation aspect
4071586 all happy people are grateful ungrateful people cannot be happy we tend to think that being unhappy leads people to complain but it is truer to say that complaining leads to people becoming unhappy
4071587 i think we need to face the fact that that place doesnt quite have many of the tourists attraction much of the tourist attractions will be in the civic district the town area you see so this hotel site will be a bit further away but it would be more affordable for budget tourists from china and india
4071588 we are pleased to announce the formation of the epix technology advisory board and welcome the additional experience and knowledge of these accomplished thought leaders which should be additive to our current and future in silico discovery and development efforts
4071589 we believe the tab is a vital strategic asset for our continued growth and we look forward to collaborating with the members of our tab as we continue to pursue new discovery targets develop our lead therapeutic product candidates and expand our proprietary technology footprint
4071590 volunteers are the backbone of our work carrying out a host of different roles to support people affected by ms
4071591 the shining star awards recognise really outstanding contributions and valerie is undoubtedly one of our most deserving winners
4071592 her many years of committed volunteering have helped to make a positive difference to the lives of people affected by ms in the west lothian area and i am delighted that we can acknowledge her dedication with this award
4071593 everyone in the west lothian branch is very proud that valerie has been recognised in this way
4071594 her commitment and hard work have been an inspiration to everyone and she is highly valued by her colleagues
4071595 but i also know that she will be the first to say that she couldnt have done it without the support of all the other volunteers in the west lothian area who give their time for the society
4071596 we would also be pleased to hear from anyone who would like to support our work by becoming a volunteer

4071601 the first time i asked was when pearse flynn was still at the club but he couldnt let me go as he was leaving
4071602 the chairman has told me motherwell have put a bid in and the spl is where i want to play so id be keen to join
4071603 they play excellent football are in the uefa cup and were third in the league last season so itd be a great move if it came around
4071604 if it happens it happens but if not ill knuckle down and get on with it
4071605 the manager has been great with me ive told him my reasons why and he understands
4071606 ill always give livingston 100 and he is happy with my performances
4071607 a win is a win and its good to be in any quarter final although wed rather have a run in one of the other cups
4071608 we are into the last eight and with st johnstone and dundee both out we must be among the favourites now
4071609 forfar were a decent side and they made it hard for us but it was closer than wed have liked
4071610 they were very unlucky in the first half with their effort which came back off the post but we missed some chances of our own
4071611 its not the sex that wrecks these guys its staying up all night looking for it
4071612 all i can advise is before a big race stick with your usual routine whatever that may be
4071613 this is an important medical issue and an economic issue
4071614 doctors see the impact of air pollution on our patients every day
4071615 some of the worst pollution is in rural areas because theyre downwind
4071616 criminalization is a poor tool for controlling hiv aids there is no public health rationale whatsoever for invoking criminal law sanctions against those who unintentionally transmit hiv or expose others to it
4071617 jean cuenca hasnt scored any goals for us yet but he works very hard for the team and for griffiths
4071618 he is only 17 and very young but if he wants to improve he has to try and play for the team a bit more he sometimes tries too much such as dribbling past three or four defenders but thats him
4071619 there are many players like this such as filipo inzaghi or pavel nedved who play alone and they are superstars i think griffiths has a big future in football
4071620 mcpake and mackay are both still our players and im very happy to have them
4071621 but i dont know what will happen if the chairman gets a very big offer for them
4071622 everyone has a price at the end of the day and although milan dont want to sell kaka they will do so if chelsea make them a 100m offer
4071623 until now there hasnt been a suitable offer for either of them and im delighted to have them
4071624 i approached the council and was eventually told the situation was being assessed but no one was able to say how long that would take
4071625 will it take somebody being killed before the council takes this seriously
4071626 i am going to start up a petition to get a safe crossing as this area has lots of families with young children and there are also a lot of elderly people around as well
4071627 we agreed a three year investment programme for new crossings in may this year and this site did not feature on the list
4071628 it was not identified as a priority as we did not receive any requests for a crossing at this time there have been no reported accidents involving injury to pedestrians in the last five years and there are crossing points at the adambrae roundabout as well as an existing overbridge nearby
4071629 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4071630 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4071631 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4071632 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4071633 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4071634 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4071635 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4071636 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4071637 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4071638 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4071639 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4071640 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4071641 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4071642 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4071661 in the past 12 months take up of broadband through a landline grew from 52 per cent of households to 58 per cent mainly as a result of consumers upgrading from dial up access to always on broadband
4071662 it directors are reasonably confident about the outlook over the next 12 months despite lingering economic uncertainty
4071663 it departments savaged headcounts after the dot com and y2k booms but we appear to be a long way from a repeat of that scenario
4071664 since the market collapsed in 2001 02 it directors have been much more restrained in their hiring so it departments do not have a skills surplus
4071665 there appears to be no end to the candidate market in sight with skills acquisition and retention still a pressing concern for it directors
4071666 we are still seeing acute shortages of candidates with net proficiency for example and project management experience remains highly sought after
4071667 faith is believing in something when common sense tells you not to

4071670 no no it cannot be we had the rifle whole time under control it was besides us he was carrying the rifle in a soft case and it may have touched a little somewhere maybe he touched a wall or something and some screw may have become loose it happens sometimes
4071671 there was some screw loose or something one screw was loose maybe there are hundreds of screws in a rifle but he bindra was reacting cleverly he made the clicks quickly to get into the centre then he shot like a machine
4071672 but i was not worried about the final he is very good at it
4071673 this is not a drama he has the medal and who cares
4071674 we did not know it but after the final he told us that he found his gun sight altered but he is a very cool boy and has lot of patience he did not panic but he maintained his cool and went on to win the gold
4071675 i dont think that blame game helps actually you cannot blame anyone its your duty to take care of your gun he was the only indian to qualify so there were shooters from other countries in that room
4071676 we will definitely be taking part it is disappointing its not happening in september october but pleasing it is taking place this year

4071681 that was the first time chinese people as a whole stood up to the world
4071682 its good for chinese people that incident proves that when chinese are upset they can find their voice
4071683 no less jingoistic than those who have never gone abroad
4071684 a significant proportion of them believe that using force to promote chinas national interests is acceptable
4071685 it means the post 1989 policy to imbue youth with nationalism through patriotic education has succeeded
4071686 to be honest when we go abroad we do find people asking strange questions like whether china has modern buildings or cars
4071687 sometimes its hard not to feel they have some bias
4071688 young chinese feel they have the right to speak out about anything

4071690 running on a regular basis can slow the effects of ageing a study by us researchers shows elderly joggers were half as likely to die prematurely from conditions like cancer than non runners they also enjoyed a healthier life with fewer disabilities the stanford university medical center team found experts said the findings in archives of internal medicine reinforced the importance that older people exercise regularly

4071841 she must publicly apologize to the speaker and his brother which i know she will not do knowing her character
4071842 any self respecting member of the legislature should know the responsibility that goes along in congressional inquiries you cannot get to the bottom of things on these inquiries if legislators like jamby have no regard for facts

4071852 well the purpose of the surge was to provide a secure space a time for the political change to occur to accomplish the reconciliation that didnt happen whatever the military success and progress that may have been made the surge didnt accomplish its goal and some of the success of the surge is that the goodwill of the iranians they decided in basra when the fighting would end they negotiated that cessation of hostilities the iranians

4071917 the wild coast was recently included in south africas network of marine reserves with the country pledging to protect 20 of its coastline including estuaries a proposed highway along the wild coast was stalled by the ministry of environmental affairs as a potential threat to the ecology of the region and with strict controls over the sardine industry it really looks as if south africa despite its many socio economic problems is prepared to show the rest of the world how to manage its marine resources
4071918 the latest salvo of spam hitting inboxes is likely to trick unsuspecting e mail users with its topical headlines and the seemingly trusted source

4071920 wimax will face stiff competition from mobile networks although it will still have a greater impact on those developing countries in which it is given a reasonable head start over mobile broadband networks

4071922 yet there are still niche markets out there for cdma and wimax and companies can still sell them as an alternative to dsl and eliminate the need for copper wires

4072039 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4072040 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4072041 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4072042 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4072043 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4072044 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4072045 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4072046 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4072047 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4072048 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4072049 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4072050 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4072051 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4072052 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4072053 it was a lot of subjects to carry at once but i really enjoyed them so i kept them all going

4072105 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry wales said today at the global brand forum in singapore
4072106 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies

4072122 this really is a very exciting time in the world of sports science it has just been truly inspirational to see the way the chinese have completely dominated the medal count from day one of the beijing games
4072123 i know that in the past the chinese have not had much success in doping and that a lot of people still remember that during the 1990s they had more than 30 swimmers fail drug tests at international meets
4072124 but this time around the local pharmaceutical community has really stepped up to the plate and delivered a spectacular home run to use a softball analogy in fact some of the new chemical compounds the chinese have come up with could turn eric the eel into michael phelps almost overnight
4072125 yes a lot of people still remember those massive lats and shoulders on the chinese girls back in the 90s but this time they really got the science right
4072126 and they had a whole shadow squad training away in the background while the rest of the team was paraded around the world not causing any fuss with their mediocre times
4072127 what was also really clever was that they outed a couple of sacrifical lambs in the lead up to the games to show theyre serious about drug testing
4072128 factor in some friendly judging and a whole hearted public relations effort and youd have to admit that the chinese really couldnt have done a better job at trying to win these olympics

4072145 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
4072146 larry and i will have a bowl of mueslix and a small shot of prune juice and be in bed by 9 oclock
4072147 well let people file by the bed and watch us go to sleep i think we can hang with the best of them until midnight
4072148 my position is that i am very pleased to be the manchester city manager and there is no change in that respect
4072149 the football operation is completely the same as it was when i first signed as manager at the club and i am looking ahead to a very important uefa cup game
4072150 i had a meeting with the players the other day and basically we need to make the group aware that im in charge and will make decisions that affect the players
4072151 it has been a difficult week in many respects but it has happened very early in my tenure and from this point onwards we can move on and work much better there have been circumstances that needed to be understood and learned from but that has now happened and its not an issue from my point of view from this point onwards
4072152 our sympathy goes to her husband billy and to their son mark merle never got over what happened
4072153 it is very emotional because it is the same christmas present every year a bunch of flowers you dont have to think about what you are going to buy her its not fair really she was such a lovely child
4072154 im really happy at liverpool and i want to stay here for as long as the club wants me
4072155 i am really settled here and i like the city the most important thing is i like the club and ive really enjoyed the two seasons ive been here the only thing i am missing is some trophies and hopefully that will come in the next year
4072156 ive never had any intentions of leaving this club sometimes things are said in the press but the boss said to me that is not relevant and he wants me here with liverpool
4072157 i am happy that steve finnan has agreed to return to international football
4072158 he is an experienced player and he still has a lot to give to the team i respect andy obriens decision and i thank him for letting us know stephen ireland has told us he is not yet ready to make himself available but has indicated that he may do so in the future as i have said before my door remains open
4072159 we will have several days together which will be very important we have a lot of work to do but i am looking forward to it
4072160 losing steven is a massive blow he has been one of our most influential players during last season and especially this pre season its a big disappointment not to have him he was a massive part of our success last season and he has come back for pre season looking just as sharp if not sharper
4072161 a repeat of the failed extremism that has characterised and plagued democratic presidential politics since the late 1960s
4072162 the only political party i ever consciously joined is the constitution party
4072163 i am writing this book strictly to examine and oppose barack obama
4072164 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
4072165 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can concentrate on football
4072166 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
4072167 the club gave me time and i appreciate that i feel for sure ive made 100 per cent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
4072168 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
4072169 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
4072170 its a great day for the club frank and english football he has agreed and signed a new five year contract it allows us to kill all the speculation of the last 18 months and allows us to concentrate on the really important thing next season
4072171 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
4072172 this summer has been very difficult personally for me and the club have been fantastic through that
4072173 in the end we got where we all want to be im very happy i have everything i need and always have i sat down and realised this club has been great for me and i feel ive been good for the club
4072174 there might be people who are disgruntled and these things can grow arms and legs
4072175 thats been no different for the time that ive been in football paul knows within himself that he cant let it worry him i see no evidence of anything thats hurtful in terms of his relationship with the players or anything like that
4072176 ive always felt you cant get too close to players
4072177 maybe you can get closer than the manager can at times youve got to keep your distance
4072178 ive seen her shes not even an overhead kick from the goal line
4072179 i just dont believe in that its got to be bad cop bad cop
4072180 a real mans man when he shook your hand you had to untangle your mangled fingers afterwards call that a handshake hed say as he crushed your hand into his
4072181 players like imaginative bright sessions and in archies they always saw an immediate value in them there was a relationship with what would be happening on saturday
4072182 its not the same when you think the bloke next to you has an eye on the managers chair
4072183 the one thing these guys have to be reassured about is that the older figure isnt after your job
4072184 with younger managers you maybe want to say something different to what they are saying but they are the manager
4072185 it can be said quietly after a meeting or after a game
4072186 if we lose the first five games of the season then yes there can be questions but that hasnt happened
4072187 weve just got to get on with it and make sure we are ready for the start of the season
4072188 at bolton sammy was familiar with the place but everybody coming in here is new even the promoted managers probably have more experience than paul hull citys phil brown has experience at bolton so he knows the scene tony pulis at stoke hasnt been at this level but hes an experienced manager tony mowbray has a load of experience in scotland and at west brom paul is the new kid on the block
4072189 thats when well find out a wee bit more about each other
4072190 maybe i would have done something maybe he would have wanted to do something totally different you judge on when the occasion arises youve got to try and keep a cool head and make sure we come to an agreement
4072191 he was a young player coming into a team with a lot of experienced players back then so it was a big ask for someone
4072192 it took him a while to settle down it wasnt just a case of coming in and fitting in straight away he had to battle to overcome quite a few things like how could he replace remi moses or norman whiteside but he buckled down hes a strong willed character paul he knows what he wants and he wont deviate from that if he sets his mind out to do something he will stick to that and see it through thats always served him well
4072193 arsenal were rattled they knew they had been in a game
4072194 we opened up arsenal but the final ingredient was not there
4072195 we knew we had to have a good start and the first half was important in europe against the top teams you dont get many chances and you have to take the ones that you do we failed to do that and we got punished
4072196 we had one bad spell in the second half conceded the goal and that deflated us
4072197 twente played with belief and spirit and in the first half they had the better chances
4072198 in the second half we took over they had given so much in the first half they could not keep up the same pace we looked comfortable but they gave us a tough game
4072199 us puts brakes on israeli plan for attack on iran nuclear facilities

4072212 they should have an enterprise wide risk management programme that would include an annual risk assessment of the risks associated with the business
4072213 and they should categorise all their risks whether they are high risk medium or low risk and develop responses to address each of these risks particularly those that are of high risk to the organisation
4072214 risk management ought to be part of the culture the dna of an organisation in fact it is important for the ceo to set the right tone from the top and ensure that everyone within the organisation embrace the concept of good risk management and strong ethical behaviour within the organisation

4072218 there will be no significant material and economic progress in muslim communities until the muslim mind is allowed to challenge the status quo of muslim conventions and even their most cherished shibboleths
4072219 i dont believe there are moderate muslims because in islam you have to believe in every teaching as a holy teaching you cannot change you have to accept it the way it is because otherwise simply you are not a muslim
4072220 the koran remains for all muslims not just fundamentalists the uncreated word of god himself it is valid for all times and places its ideas are absolutely true and beyond all criticism to question it is to question the very word of god and hence blasphemous a muslims duty is to believe it and obey its divine commands

4072246 alright ill help but if edward comes after us im denying involvement

4072271 wayne was a much loved son grandson brother and uncle who served his country with distinction and sadly paid the ultimate price he was our true hero

4072273 it was abundantly clear to everyone who met wayne that his strength and personality
4072274 waynes death is a huge tragedy but he was a committed soldier who understood the risks and the importance of his work as do his friends and every soldier in the regiment

4072296 city supporters have been well aware that like many other league of ireland clubs cork city has been facing serious financial problems however the disclosure that the club is considering an application to the high court for examinership has raised real fears about the future of the club
4072297 senior soccer has been an important part of corks sporting tradition and cork city has played that role since it was established in 1984 the continued operation of city is also crucial for the league of ireland given that it is the only major club outside of the dublin louth area
4072298 it is a particularly worrying situation that cork city is in financial trouble given that attracts the consistently best attendances in the league and has a solid record of achievement having won the league in 2005 and the cup last year
4072299 cork city is not alone is facing serious economic problems and there is a real fear that we will not see the current season out without at least one club going to the wall

4072314 si crees en dios crees que dios est presente en la vida en el amor en el matrimonio y en la sexualidad parece natural hablar de sexo y suprimir algunos tab es y etiquetas del pecado

4072347 just think of what young people who grow up with this will expect

4072352 feeling down and dirty felling kinda mean ive been from one to another extreme this time i had a good time aint got time to waist i wanna stick around till i cant see straight

4072366 i understand they have put puryear in the controversial category
4072367 its very rare for a district court nominee to become controversial usually they just fly through
4072368 groups can attack a nominee but youll never see the nominee respond to anything except at hearings
4072369 as far as his qualifications go he was at the top of his class in law school he clerked on the u s court of appeals he has legislative experience in the u s senate he manages litigation for a big fortune 500 company and the aba american bar association rated him as qualified
4072370 gus realizes this is a lame duck year in politics
4072371 its true for all nominees whether youre in the deal or not is beyond your control

4072378 the structures of the compounds made by electric discharge differ from those formed by uv photolysis so the hydrolysis time could be very different some of the photochemical products when uv light is used are hydrocarbons that do not react with water
4072379 was meant to mimic charged particle interactions which ferris admits is a process at work on titan
4072380 uv light radiation produces tholins that look more like titans haze
4072381 some if not most of the products we make also dont react with water
4072382 tholins formed at low pressure seem to look more like titans haze than those formed at higher pressures you can make tholins at low pressures using uv light you cannot make tholins at low pressure using plasma discharge and to make the amount of tholins we needed for the experiment we needed to use the discharge technique uv photolysis only produces small amounts
4072383 the children really gave more to us than we gave to them
4072384 i had applied to go five years ago but mary wouldnt come with me so then i re applied this year
4072385 there was one family of children there whose parents had to give them away because they couldnt afford to keep them
4072386 what was amazing though was how well they could all cope with life
4072387 and each night during the two weeks a child would be picked out and have something special said about them like you are kind or you are sharing over the two weeks every child was picked out and they were just so delighted that was the highlight really
4072388 i had no problem fundraising i actually had over the amount people were just walking up and handing me money
4072389 it really is about 70 years behind ireland the childrens goalpost was just a stick hung between two trees
4072390 i really hope to do it again the children were just so loving and beautiful they really craved affection
4072391 i got a phone call early this morning monday ands when i saw it i felt like crying after all the hard work we had done
4072392 i just cant understand it we had thousands of people here in town for the world fleadh and not a flower or a basket was touched and now this it has to be locals its so disheartening we were out only last thursday night watering the baskets and people must have thought we were mad but even in the bad weather they have to be watered and fed
4072393 the sooner the cctv cameras are put up the better i would love to see them caught and they should be made go out and clean up the whole town in full view of everyone
4072394 at the moment the water comes in from the swan a planning application was turned down last year due to the prospect of a water shortage in the area
4072395 iarnr d ireann has decided to charge parking fees in their car parks at a number of train stations around the country in many areas car parks are used by people who are daily commuters who use trains to get to and from work they are proposing a parking fee for regular commuters of approximately 8 per week which is 400 per annum
4072396 currently regular commuters can get full tax relief at the top rate of tax on monthly or annual commuter tickets
4072397 people who use public transport to go to and from work have to be able to park their cars at train stations
4072398 in conjunction with the other selectors we decided to start a rebuilding process this year that involved the introduction of 10 players to senior inter county football and it proved a very difficult year for us
4072399 being an inter county manager is a full time job
4072400 while i felt i had the support of the players to continue with the rebuilding process for it to succeed i needed the support of everyone in the county from the top down and i felt i didnt have that support to continue on that basis i felt it best to step aside
4072401 there are unrealistic expectations in senior inter county management and that is there for all to see i suppose that is a reflection of the society we now live in success is demanded instant ly while patience and loyalty are in very short supply
4072402 so far this year eight managers have gone and there are still a couple of months left in the season i was very sad to see colm coyle and john maughan vacating their positions in very acrimonious circumstances
4072403 and when you see people like paddy crozier john omahony and micky harte who have had unbelievable success at national level having their ability being questioned it begs the question is it worth it
4072404 for me there is a far more serious danger coming down the tracks for the gaa and the laois county board the lure of australian football is causing major problems for all counties but laois seems to be the hardest hit
4072405 conor meredith has been offered a contract zach tuohy is going out to australia next week and donie kingston and others like him are also being courted by the australian clubs
4072406 when that kind of talent is being siphoned off a county it makes it next to impossible for that county to achieve success its very disheartening for those people who are bringing players through from under 12 right up to senior
4072407 this is one of the biggest projects to ever have been constructed in laois and you think they would have done some proper planning for it i dont see how they can expect a road which has roughly 50 trucks passing on it an hour to take any more
4072408 this wont continue because it actually cant continue the road will disappear it will become impassable
4072409 the road is virtually unidentifiable some days i remember coming out one day and you were just hit by the damage i couldnt believe it the road looked like it had been hit by a blitz
4072410 its like a heritage trail where in the midlands would you get eight stone bridges on a two mile stretch
4072411 i used to walk quiet a lot around the road during the day i just couldnt risk it now
4072412 i was doing the show anyway and i had been at the hearts versus motherwell game on the saturday
4072413 its like leaving the shire and heading off to mordor i never even wanted to go to mordor
4072414 it can be a bit up and down good and bad its a bit of a roller coaster but there is nothing like it the reviews have been good and the numbers have been decent despite the fact that everybody seems to be struggling with fewer people coming to this years event
4072415 i was at it before to have a look and see if it was something i could do it can be a bit of a grind but i was under no illusions edinburgh is a great city and i think i have greatly benefited from it there is a huge amount of stress surrounding the festival as comedians have invested large amounts of money into it ive definitely learned a lot from it though
4072416 it was a harsh decision though but then again ive heard that the other one was over the line so maybe theyve cancelled each other out
4072417 we know we didnt play as well as we can and they did well so we have to be pleased to get out of it with a nil nil
4072418 we probably didnt deserve it but thats football and over the years weve always seemed to find these kind of games difficult but gone on to do well and hopefully this time it will be the same
4072419 i think that its good to get out and thank our supporters throughout the province because they play a big part in the teams success
4072420 leinster is not just about dublin and though we are based in donnybrook and play in the rds there is huge support right across the province its important to expand our training sessions and visit the clubs and were looking forward to the day
4072421 i try to get out and see the different places and i enjoyed bringing my family to visit the likes of kerry and up along the west coast wicklow is another beautiful county but i havent seen much of the midlands and i hope to do so over the coming months
4072422 we know that we have to put in the effort now because we want to start strongly in the magners league we have recruited some good players and the squad is really competitive which will enable us to rotate at times hopefully we can also stay injury free
4072423 this is the time to try new combinations because we have to start strongly in the league and cardiff away is one of the toughest away games that you can play
4072424 this is an exciting part of the season because the pre season games are only a week or so away we will try to learn a lot from these training sessions and take them into the three trial games which are very important
4072425 it was fantastic england win everything and are cocky to beat them by one point was so much better and sweeter than beating them by 20 points
4072426 i set myself goals to win the british open and the european championships which we have achieved i set myself the target of scoring a full individual score of 300 which i have still yet to do the world championships will be great to compete against the likes of the americans the goal for the championship though is to win the team event and hopefully come in the top three in the individual event
4072427 the difficulty has always been that they have a vast number of shooters and so have a lot to pick from were still behind especially when you have to be over 16 to compete here whereas in england its a lot younger
4072428 its definitely a goal its realistic in one sense and touch and go in another hopefully though in the next three olympics i can get through
4072429 it was in a copybook i drew the pictures and everything
4072430 writing was something i always wanted to do but i never really had the time to do it
4072431 i realised there was no point having them sitting upstairs on the computer
4072432 well when i first started off i thought i was going to be famous so i didnt want anyone to know it was me so i just put down meg stevens i always wanted to be called megan and my husbands name is steven so thats how i came up with the name now the thing is the only way to sell the books is to let people know its me writing them
4072433 ive about another six books finished on the computer upstairs as well
4072434 the two eldest would have read the books and ask if there are anymore to read and that gives you encouragement
4072435 while i have managed to meet the standard there has been restrictions on the numbers we could bring over it was a bit tight in the end but i squeezed through
4072436 to be honest im a bit old in the tooth to be getting nervous at the thought of the experience
4072437 i did both the shot putt and the discus in the athens games i decided to just aim for the discus afterwards as i hoped to be excellent at one code rather than be average at two
4072438 you want to come into the tournament at your peak bu t normally you have reached this after the qualifying section so its important to keep it ticking over im training practically every day i slowed down on the weights after christmas and im concentrating on the technique and balance theres no point being built like hercules if you dont have the technique
4072439 ill be looking to break my personal best but in regards to winning a medal ill have to shoot my best and hope that others have an off day
4072440 well be competing at around 5pm local time which will mean that it will be cooling down at the time we took a familiarisation tour of the beijing last year so we know what to expect
4072441 it is very disappointing im disappointed for the girls themselves for the team for the panel because certainly the football is there and we didnt get to show what were made of today as a team and i think thats two matches on the trot now where we havent produced what were capable of producing but that is no good if you dont produce it on the day you could be as a good as any player in the country and individually we have super players and we just didnt click as a team today its disappointing for us and i think its sad for them to be exiting at this stage of the championship when there is probably a lot more in them
4072442 i dont know about odds i dont know if id ever trust the bookies yeah it is disappointing to go out at this stage and there is certainly the panel and as i say the players are there and its to get the connection right as a unit we didnt get started today and we didnt get started the last day so that needs to be looked at from that point of view theres no doubt that galway wanted it that bit more today we had the chances we had a number of goal chances in the first half that we didnt take and we had a number of point chances in the first half that we didnt take and we put ourselves under pressure in the second half looking for the illusive goal or two if we had scored what we should have scored in the first half the pressure wouldnt have been on us and as the game progressed it got more and more difficult to crack the defence
4072443 i would never fault the individuals really they all come to try hard and to play as best they can it didnt happen today and yes you were right we had our chances and we didnt take those chances and if we had taken those chances it would have been a different game
4072444 its championship that counts at the end of the day and its nice to have a run in the league and get yourself prepared for the championship but what people look at is championship and to be considered in the top batch of teams you need to be winning championship you need to be showing what youre made of in the championship and unfortunately we didnt do that
4072445 certainly the players are there within the county theyre certainly there in the panel and maybe we need to look at where we are not connecting as a unit we have fine individual players and players who train very hard and work very hard for the county and give it everything and maybe its that point where were missing the connection as playing as a unit and thats something that we need to look at
4072446 im only here a short time because john had to go unfortunately and that was a bit of an upset but thats certainly not an excuse
4072447 motorists and especially motor cyclists have to be especially careful when driving on these country roads and should drive at suitable sp eeds allowing them to anticipate traffic and pedestrians

4072450 a friend of mine had it done with the company and she was really happy with it i have a young daughter and im trying to keep up with her so the glasses were getting in the way i had been considering it for a while and had saved money for it so i just decided to go for it
4072451 if i knew it was going to be this good i would have done it years ago i was looking out the window the following morning without glasses and i could see everything i was back in work by wednesday
4072452 im going to take her to lapland to meet santa at christmas and maybe some designer sun glasses for myself

4072494 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4072495 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen

4072506 as the russians move into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning from senator mccain and senator obama one had a kind of moral neutrality to it
4072507 and i say it respectfully to senator obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president on jan 20th of 2009
4072508 i think that whatever we think at the moment that we can all reserve that for a future time
4072509 and i think judgments will be made about how we handled this situation how we approached the situation in iraq and how much experience and knowledge and background means in selecting the american peoples decision about who should be commander in chief
4072510 but i dont think were going to reignite the cold war here with russia i think this is a very serious situation but i dont see this as a return to nuclear standoffs et cetera et cetera

4072512 im sorry to be repetitious this is no time for that this is no time for that the time now is for the united states of america to act united on behalf of the people of the country of georgia and not do a lot of partisan sniping
4072513 and i say it respectfully to senator obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president on jan 20th of 2009
4072514 yesterday i heard senator mccain say we are all georgians now
4072515 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
4072516 devil went down to georgia and he was willing to make a deal
4072517 mccain wanted to make a distinction between himself and obama he did he overreacted was shooting from the hip and showed that he had an opinion before he had the facts this is what bush did in iraq mccain may even be more dangerous because he did not learn from iraq bush at least waited until the facts were available

4072580 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4072581 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4072582 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4072583 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4072584 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4072585 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4072586 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4072587 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4072588 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4072589 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4072590 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4072591 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4072592 dit is bizar we hadden met nul man uit en drie spelers op de honken een paar punten op scorebord kunnen krijgen en misschien zelfs wel meer door de nederlaag tegen taiwan zullen we nog een groot land moeten verslaan en dan gaan de runs punten straks een belangrijke rol spelen die kans is ons nu ontnomen in de eerder uitgereikte reglementen staat alleen iets over uitstel niet over staken ik kreeg tijdens het tweede oponthoud ineens een aanvulling op de regels uitgereikt met de nieuwe regel daar hebben we tegen geprotesteerd

4072645 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4072646 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4072663 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4072664 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4072665 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4072666 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4072673 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4072674 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4072675 at some time it will be necessary to choose between the prestige of this relatively virtual project and partnership on questions that require collective action
4072676 only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
4072677 deepen the very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
4072678 strongly rejected insinuations of russias non observance of the principles of resolving
4072679 she will continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defence of a free georgia
4072680 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4072681 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4072682 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4072683 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4072684 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4072685 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4072686 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4072687 i understand they have put puryear in the controversial category
4072688 its very rare for a district court nominee to become controversial usually they just fly through
4072689 groups can attack a nominee but youll never see the nominee respond to anything except at hearings
4072690 as far as his qualifications go he was at the top of his class in law school he clerked on the u s court of appeals he has legislative experience in the u s senate he manages litigation for a big fortune 500 company and the aba american bar association rated him as qualified
4072691 gus realizes this is a lame duck year in politics
4072692 its true for all nominees whether youre in the deal or not is beyond your control
4072693 at the end of the session its who wants a bridge in vermont
4072694 im glad the judiciary committee is taking a closer look at mr puryear as a candidate because the issues we raised are legitimate issues
4072695 despite the previously reached agreement russians are deploying additional forces in gori and fortifying the city at the same time russian armed forces have returned to poti
4072696 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
4072697 strongly rejected insinuations of russias non observance of the principles of resolving
4072698 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4072699 up to the point of what occurred at the campground

4072701 heinous cruel and depraved are tough words in the english language but none of these words fully express the outrage of what you will see
4072702 i have shooters open up a lot of room for me they almost knocked every open shot in the first three games i cant let them down
4072703 if we lost this game we might not have any chance to play in the top eight this game makes the next one very important for us
4072704 now we celebrate this for 10 minutes rest and have to look to the next game
4072705 their apparel is doing better than theyve been for years theyve gone back to their roots you have to give management some credit
4072706 macro headwinds continued to hammer consumers making them increasingly value focused playing well to the strengths of the discounters like wal mart
4072707 the chinese team is responsible for a lot of peoples dreams
4072708 this year has not been very good for china theres been a lot of disasters so these olympic games theres a lot of pressure its impossible not to be nervous and its how to cope with the nerves is our job and right now i feel very excited
4072709 after the athens games i wanted to retire from the national team because i thought i was in very good shape back then if i couldnt win a gold medal then i thought i could never get a gold
4072710 extra training would not have had an effect i was worried that even if i could have adjusted myself to the best standards in 2008 i could not get a gold
4072711 but my coach huang yubin kept on encouraging me he took me on a vacation and told me that the 2008 games would be the greatest chance in 100 years and i should have a try at it he kept pushing me and then he kicked me to the highest position on the podium
4072712 i thought a month ago if i would get this medal i would be every emotional
4072713 but im really not because we won the team gold medal
4072714 he must be the most consistent gymnast and to do it in front of the home crowd with all that pressure thats just a great performance
4072715 actually i did not do any research in regards to the previous medals for france
4072716 after more than three years of development and ten months of testing in closed alpha we are very proud to release wuala to the public

4072732 with the federal government expected to introduce new copyright reform within a matter of days a facebook group seemed like a good way to educate the public about an important issue users sent invitations to their lists of friends and enclosed the message with links to a few relevant websites
4072733 what happened next was truly remarkable within hours the group started to grow first 50 members then 100 then 1 000 one week later there were 10 000 members two weeks later there were over 25 000 members with another canadian joining the group every 30 seconds
4072734 much to the surprise of skeptics who paint government as unable or unwilling to listen to public concerns those voices had an immediate impact ten days after the facebook groups launch prentice delayed introducing the new copyright reforms seemingly struck by the rapid formation of concerned citizens who were writing letters and raising awareness

4072747 leaving approved clients high and dry is an extreme response to tightening market conditions
4072748 the need to make fair balanced and transparent credit decisions and to stand by these decisions is paramount or hard pressed south african consumers are once again going to bear the brunt of industry inefficiencies and indifference
4072749 but it would seem that rash or in the least marginal decision making has now caused a bank to renege on commitments already made
4072750 were targeting sales of 100 000 units of this new vehicle in north america
4072751 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4072752 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4072753 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4072754 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4072755 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4072756 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4072757 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4072758 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4072759 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4072760 its a little bit more contemporary has a little bit more edge to it not as traditional even though its still a traditional look
4072761 more feminine from the jewelry to the handbags boots are huge this year
4072762 those things the little details the accessories are going to really differentiate the look than from where weve seen it
4072763 adding the feminine details is key this year just add a color or a ruffle i think thats important
4072764 were going to share some ideas on how to move the process forward
4072765 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
4072766 niketa was under a lot of stress she was upset and tired
4072767 although we are in pain at the loss god spared our child a life of agony
4072768 like other indonesian citizens our clients have constitutional rights including that they not be tortured
4072769 a lot of my friends in the music industry have conversations about how to distribute music and it tends to centre on how to make money
4072770 i think the focus should be on the artistry and creativity not focusing on the commercial side of things musicians should concentrate on making records and not be too concerned about how people listen
4072771 the point of producing music isnt whether audiences will buy it or listen to it for free i might be naive but i think if you make a good record people will want to listen regardless of the medium its delivered by
4072772 i didnt spend a year in the most expensive studio in england with the most expensive producer in america and the most expensive graphic designer in london to give it away
4072773 anybody doing that is demeaning their own art if i had my way id charge double for my album but the record company wont let me

4072784 first off before i point any fingers i personally do want to apologise for the incident that happened at the ozone awards i hope you all dont get the wrong impression of me or my city
4072785 i apologise once again for everything that happened but i cannot apologise for having to defend myself from someone bringing unexpected or un called violence to me and my family at any time
4072786 i have to take the time out to apologise to the kids and to anyone who follows and supports my career for what happened at the ozone awards
4072787 i told myself that i was gonna do my best for the new era of the streets not to go through the experiences that i go through in life for a split second i almost entertained the little girl tactics of a person who is really irrelevant nowadays
4072788 i would like the world to tell mr jones that he can thank me later for his split second of fame
4072789 i had my house repossessed seven men broke down my door and told me i hadnt kept up my repayments and therefore they would be taking all my belongings
4072790 the house was now the property of the bank i ended up on the street with my girlfriend and child
4072791 youll get to see the whole video when it drops soon
4072792 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalise united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films
4072793 due to circumstances beyond our control it was with deep regret that the decision was taken to postpone the miss world 2008 final the decision was taken in the interests of the contestants and the miss world organisation
4072794 i have no view on whether it should be remade but it doesnt have my blessing
4072795 im not co producing it and i wont be involved in any way the first i heard about it was when people sent me cuttings from u s papers
4072796 whoever settled anything with war at the moment it seems to be a lot of posturing and the two sides showing each other how big their guns are
4072797 but i hope that the violence can end before any more people are killed
4072798 she is worried about her mum and brother being there but they are not completely panicking because they are in tbilisi
4072799 everyone has been told to sit tight and see how it pans out
4072800 her mother told katie that all georgian men over the age of 18 are to go to ossetia
4072801 weve started conversations about it and i think in the next 30 or 60 days well be able to talk completely about that
4072802 this statement is to say that after so much speculation and comments the actors dolores fonzi and gael garcia bernal are indeed expecting a baby at the start of next year 09
4072803 a few months ago i did a quick interview with entertainment tonight and i stuck my foot in my mouth and said that i was having twins by accident i begged them to edit that out as i wasnt ready for it to be out there then but when i was i would give it to them exclusively
4072804 they really could have ran with it but they said they would not they actually kept their word which i found so refreshing i couldnt believe it
4072805 i really want to thank them for that they are one of the last remaining entertainment news shows that has kept its dignity and high standards in the current morally degraded climate we are now in
4072806 shes hired some pretty high powered consultants to advise her and put it all together

4072911 las coincidencias alcanzadas entre ambos pa ses para generar mayor conciencia entre los transportistas que utilizan esta v a entendiendo que el exceso de peso en las unidades tambi n genera un perjuicio al estado de transitabilidad de los caminos
4072912 con las autoridades chilenas se habl sobre la responsabilidad de los transportistas al circular con el eje vasculante levantado cargando o repartiendo mayor peso en menor cantidad de ejes cuesti n que evidentemente deteriora mucho el camino
4072913 desde chile plantearon la posibilidad de instalar una balanza que no implicar a el pago de tasa alguna a menos que el transporte de carga evidencie exceso de peso
4072914 esta balanza no va a incorporar como no lo hacen las balanzas en argentina el cobrar por el pesado aunque s cobrar an por el exceso pero en esto debe quedar claro que la colocaci n de una balanza en realidad tiene como objetivo preservar el camino y no generar un ente de recaudaci n sino que la multa puede servir para solucionar los inconvenientes que genera en las rutas el exceso de peso
4072915 las balanzas pueden servir para que las empresas de transporte desde un inicio de carga limiten su peso antes de ser multadas pero esto fue un anticipo de las autoridades de chile solamente porque en concreto no se habl de plazos para su instalaci n y tampoco se habl si se cobrar an multas o s lo estar a a modo de precauci n
4072916 tiene prevista la instalaci n de una nueva balanza en la zona cercana a donde funciona la actual en r o grande para controlar los pesos cuesti n que es muy importante para la conservaci n de los caminos
4072917 en la importancia de encarar un control m s preciso respecto del uso de los ejes vasculantes de los camiones para lo cual es muy importante que el cami n haya sido previamente pesado porque de lo contrario no se sabe qu carga o cu ntas toneladas est trasladando

4072965 georgian forces trained and equipped by the pentagon and the u s government killed 10 russian peacekeepers early this morning in a provocation attack that has escalated into military conflict but the subsequent corporate media coverage would have us believe that the u s and nato backed client state georgia is a helpless victim when in actual fact a far more nuanced geopolitical strategy is being played out
4072966 an american mercenary has been captured by russian forces along with a number of georgian soldiers according to a report from the russian news website izvestia providing more evidence that the u s and nato are covertly supporting the georgian army in a proxy war with russia
4072967 among the participants of the 5th annual organization summit are dominique strauss kahn the managing director of the international monetary fund mikheil saakashvili the president of georgia marek siwiec vice president of the european parliament aleksander kwasniewski the president of poland in 1995 2005 mario david vice president of european peoples party victor chernomyrdin ambassador of the russian federation to ukraine key strategists of the leading usa political parties karl rove the republican and bob shrum the democrat

4072970 were thinking of opening up a motley crue amusement park
4072971 yeah you can be buried in your own mick mars casket would it be gene simmons price
4072972 anybody ive played it for has gone wow motleys back
4072973 the album is loosely based on the dirt each song is like a mini story and you can plug in into the book some of its funny some of its serious and in your face its like a typical successful motley crue record
4072974 i wanted to hear a lot of guitars and snotty lyrics i didnt want loops and samples i dont want to be nine inch nails or jay z or rage against the machine or gwen stefani i dont wanna be over thought or over processed me and mick just wanted to sound like f ing motley crue
4072975 this wasnt four guys sitting in a room scratching their heads trying to create songs
4072976 these songs were written and then the whole band turned them into motley crue songs thats what albums like shout at the devil too fast for love and dr feelgood were on later albums we got into jam mode and it was hard to focus it wasnt songs first
4072977 so lets put em all together and put it out in front of tens of thousands of people around the country thats something to be proud of its important for us that rock continues
4072978 theres always people saying that rock is dead rock is over people are always out to kill rock and roll were the ugly stepchild of the music business and yet were the one brand of music that continues to be viable and valuable we want to go out there and stand up for rock like we have been our whole career

4072980 richard diebenkorn artist and carey stanton collector their stanford connection
4072981 this equity could grow dramatically if the results of dr schatzbergs government sponsored research find that mifepristone could be used to treat psychotic major depression
4072982 appropriate steps were taken to prevent bias or actual conflict of interest
4072983 dr schatzberg did not select or screen the participants treat the participants or consult on the treatment they received collect the data from the participants visits or analyze the data
4072984 it would not have been appropriate for him to do so
4072985 so the question arises how could dr schatzberg monitor the research funded with his nih grants if he was not involved closely in the study
4072986 despite our belief that stanford nimh and dr schatzberg have handled this grant in accordance with the regulations and applicable policies and with due regard for the integrity of the research
4072987 we can see how having dr schatzberg continue as the principal investigator on the grant can create an appearance of conflict of interest
4072988 but its an antibiotic it cant be making you depressed
4072989 i thought id stop you before you got to mcdonalds since dor doesnt really go indoors that much i said wed meet him over in that little park with the duck pond thanks for coming by the way
4072990 the sculpture crew gets people from all sorts of departments
4072991 for art students its a great way to further their education by seeing how much maintenance is required for certain kinds of sculptures
4072992 but also we know that stanford students are the ones who will purchase art donate art and become the patrons of the arts in the future
4072993 its a nice way to take a break from studying
4072994 its great if you like hauling hoses getting wet and being in the sun when the weather is so great
4072995 plus its a good job to have because its really self directed
4072996 with this job you get to see many different parts of campus
4072997 you get to work in lifts and harnesses you get to touch and climb on the statues in the museum and youre invited to museum openings its particularly valuable for people making sculptures to see the amount of maintenance required and when you work with the outdoor pieces it helps artists understand the logistics of sculpting
4072998 even if we removed the patina from this bronze sculpture itll be back once the water is turned back on
4072999 these purple areas you dont see naturally with bronze they might be caused by some kind of chemical in the water
4073000 its mainly art majors who are on the crew but even so you learn a lot about the art over time
4073001 now if i go around to different cities ill see a sculpture and think oh its a moore ive learned to appreciate the sculptures more and now sometimes ill get annoyed when i see them dirty or vandalized

4073006 everybody reported increasing disability as they get older especially since were talking about people who were around 60 when they started
4073007 however we found that over time the runners group had very low levels of disability that increased very slowly the controls on the other hand had disability that increased much more quickly at the end of the study the difference between the disability levels was very dramatic
4073008 so not only were they less disabled but they lived longer as well
4073009 we statistically adjusted for many factors such as obesity and age
4073010 we also chose pretty healthy people in our control group they were not obese had normal body weight had the same education levels as the runners and didnt drink or smoke much we tried to restrict it so that the main difference between the two groups was running
4073011 adopting an exercising program even in the 50s or 60s will be beneficial down the road were just really excited that were able to show benefits of exercise not only in living longer but living healthier up into the 80s
4073012 we think its probably vigorous exercise in general that produce these results
4073013 even though we chose the groups for running and non running we dont necessarily think that there is anything specific to running that running is better than cycling or swimming or any other form of regular aerobic exercise
4073014 vorig jaar bleken de lampen toch wat te zwak we hebben gekozen voor een andere manier waardoor de ramen aan de buitenkant veel duidelijker te zien zijn we hebben dat in juni getest en het is een stuk verbeterd
4073015 er zijn 34 ramen beschikbaar vari rend in prijs van 750 tot 1500 euro maar hier projecteren we geen bedrijfslogos op sponsors krijgen een vermelding op een bord in de tuin van de kerk verder houden we het natuurlijk ingetogen zoals bij het karakter van de kerk hoort
4073016 met een lichtbrug maken we die verbinding ook maar dit project is makkelijker door te zetten aldus josephine weber die dit samen met mia schaap organiseert
4073017 het is een nogal rare situatie ik moet uit de krant vernemen dat ik hier nog maar twee jaar kan blijven terwijl er nog helemaal geen afspraken met de gemeente of met fortis zijn gemaakt
4073018 ook op het hoofdkantoor weten ze van niets er zijn in het verleden wel plannen gemaakt en de ondernemers is gevraagd om mee te werken in een bouwteam maar ik heb er al drie jaar niets meer van gehoord

4073033 by 2012 we hope to have expanded availability to the point where every patient who wants access to an experimental cancer treatment can have it
4073034 inherent in experimental cancer medicine is the possibility that any individual patient will benefit because it is a new treatment
4073035 then we are absolutely the right organisation to support the process for doing so one of the things we think we could do really well would be to provide entirely independent objective information for individuals to make up their own mind we think we could do that very well and would be happy to do that

4073066 this mission was good for the iraqi army it shows that we are concerned about the area and here for the people
4073067 the area we went into has been known for terrorist activity and going in showed that the terrorists cannot have this area
4073068 prior to even coming into the area we spent five days surveying speaking with the local sheikhs and leaders gaining information on what to expect
4073069 we are making sure the ia stays focused in the area they play more of a dominant role in the region and the people see them and interact with them
4073070 the main thing is to keep the ia in the lead
4073071 the soldiers involved were well prepared and there was good work between the coalition and ia
4073072 the proof is always in the actions and not just the words so well take a wait and see approach
4073073 weve continued to improve our resource management section and accountability im confident those critiques were not uncommon in an organization that was formed out of a dozen
4073074 im confident were on a path to solve those issues
4073075 that describes in detail unfunded counter ied requirements and needs including any plans to address the unfunded requirements and needs in future budgets
4073076 well have a proportion of how much force is deployed
4073077 we wont have urgent needs and that number will go down were not on a steep growth pattern
4073078 we spent lots of money in the first couple of years fielding jammers

4073087 you submit vouchers for portion of travel particularly if youre going to be deployed in a place for a long time
4073088 paying 100 up front and knowing itll be reimbursed quickly is a great electronic advancement but soldiers deploying into a war zone have far more important things on their minds that filing travel vouchers
4073089 meanwhile back on the home front especially for junior enlisted and guard and reservists who are taking a cut in pay while being activated that 100 means groceries and gasoline
4073090 years of inaction at the dod continue to speak volumes about senior leaderships commitment to our servicemembers and civil servants
4073091 when it comes to sexual assault in the military the dod has absolutely no credibility
4073092 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier
4073093 i can assure you the army treats this very very seriously
4073094 civilians are not afforded the same protections as active duty military personnel after suffering an assault
4073095 if i knew then what i know now i cant say for sure i would have reported it
4073096 we keep thinking that the dod would get it by now but they dont
4073097 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
4073098 i dont know how political it was i had a high profile case
4073099 ive been told im the oldest ever female olympian of any nation of all time
4073100 im just still kicking and im not putting any restrictions on myself it doesnt say i have to stop at a certain age
4073101 in fact the oldest olympic medalist was in shooting and he was 73 back in the early 1900s
4073102 im not ruling anything out i still feel good and i still have that competitive fire in me
4073103 what ive probably done in a lot of areas is that ive tried too hard
4073104 i shoot great technique ive been told this not just by u s coaches but other international coaches its just somethings happening just a few times in a match that throws me out of some competitions thats a mental thing and you know the brain the mind is a terrible thing
4073105 you still have to have the same mental approach have to have the same techniques to execute the shot
4073106 there may be a different perspective in maybe somebody who is younger or hasnt been here before but thats just all part of experience just having general experience in life
4073107 throughout shooting you will find that some things work at a certain period of time and then after a while it doesnt work anymore so you maybe try something different
4073108 im way advanced than i was when i first started shooting but its some mental things that really grab me at certain times and it hurts me in the match
4073109 some days youre really good some days youre really bad and some days youre mediocre
4073110 thats what makes shooting interesting and i guess challenging you can shoot a perfect score and the next day go out and you arent diddly squat

4073184 there have been ongoing discussions with the developer tea leaf arts the nominated occupier and the council for some time now regarding the gallery space at 100 104 endwell road also known as the teafactory
4073185 the developer has recently confirmed that they are willing to undertake a number of improvements to the existing shell that would enable tea leaf arts to occupy and commence trading from the gallery unit tea leaf arts have been provided with a copy of the final lease and a request to sign the lease and send it back as soon as possible
4073186 theyre arguing about the terms and the developer is applying pressure on tla to sign the lease
4073187 our position is that until the unit is provided in a reasonable state for occupation and the lease has been signed the residential units within the scheme should not be occupied
4073188 to sign the lease and send it back as soon as possible

4073231 peter has shown that he is wholly committed to the process of transformation and if he decides on a certain permutation for a specific match one cannot then question his commitment
4073232 weve seen since the outset of peters tenure as the national coach that he has created a climate on the rugby landscape for black talents to develop and one just has to recall who was included in his first springbok training group
4073233 after a few months now peter has significantly increased the pool of black talent that can do south african rugby proud and his efforts must be commended peter has the delicate task of balancing results and transformation and no one can fault him on this score

4073285 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4073286 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

4073357 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
4073358 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4073359 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4073360 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
4073361 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
4073362 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
4073363 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes

4073458 center of world power extending from germany and poland in the east through russia and china to the pacific and including the middle east and the indian subcontinent
4073459 the most immediate us task is to make certain that no state or combination of states gains the capacity to expel the united states from eurasia or even to diminish significantly its decisive arbitration role
4073460 within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater
4073461 war in the causasus towards a broader russia us military confrontation
4073462 attacks were timed to coincide with the olympics largely with a view to avoiding frontpage media coverage

4073465 was not meant to be won leading to the restoration of georgian sovereignty over the province it was intended to destabilize the region while triggering a us nato confrontation with russia
4073466 aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
4073467 commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
4073468 i kept on telling my staff im worried about hawaii
4073469 its going to be really embarrassing if we dont pull it out i think i need to spend two or three days campaigning they said no

4073471 a home for the liberal anti war agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity
4073472 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4073473 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
4073474 the us should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course
4073475 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
4073476 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression in which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
4073477 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
4073478 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
4073479 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
4073480 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
4073481 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
4073482 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
4073483 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
4073484 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
4073485 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
4073486 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
4073487 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
4073488 im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
4073489 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this
4073490 it has become a race to be see who can be the tougher i cant see anybody suddenly stepping back and becoming a voice of moderation and calling for calm
4073491 the panel of game industry experts felt the overall standard of this years entries exceeded all their expectations both in terms of breadth of subject matter and overall game quality
4073492 in a climate of spiralling costs and product slippages dare consistently manages to highlight what is achievable by the best new talent looking to enter the games business in just 10 weeks
4073493 the quality is the best we have ever seen and it is possible to see some of these prototypes becoming commercial
4073494 dare to be digitals success is demonstrated by the very high proportion of previous contestants who have been hired by a whole range of companies such as electronic arts rare denki realtime worlds and lionhead
4073495 we got to washington and got fat lazy and greedy misbehaving and not trusting the vote of the people not trusting their instincts
4073496 keep in mind people do not reject the values that we hold on to and believe in what they rejected was our misbehavior what theyve rejected was our failure to lead
4073497 eds one of the partners of the transys consortium has sought to challenge the procurement arrangements for the new contract transport for london are vigorously defending this challenge and have appealed against the interim court order we remain committed to delivering better value for money and to ensuring a seamless transition to any new contract from 2010
4073498 its amazing how far she has come in six years and its like shes completing the cycle coming from a reality show having a hugely successful career and now shes judging future stars

4073511 i wanted to design something completely different and provide a service that wasnt there before so everything has been customised and built to order

4073525 its been so difficult for the past few days but yesterday the russians came and it has been different
4073526 the first step is joint patrols with the russian army and georgian police
4073527 the idea is for people to start returning to their homes
4073528 have received strict orders from the supreme commander in chief to apply wartime laws to looters
4073529 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4073530 all the young men have been killed the ossetians are shooting them
4073531 for another two days russian troops will stay in the region to carry out procedures of handing over control functions to georgian law enforcement bodies after which they will leave
4073532 all buildings are in normal shape the town is supplied with water and electricity
4073533 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of any place of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbours that what it thinks about u s policy
4073534 we will leave only 10 armed men for each side
4073535 in lahore we tried to control the panic at least by circulating the print in 4 cinemas using the only print censor print we had
4073536 the u s food and drug administration and other health organizations around the world have concluded that msg is safe but the question remains is it healthy
4073537 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4073538 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4073539 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4073540 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4073541 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4073542 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4073543 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4073544 about 30 per cent to 40 per cent of our beverage exports have been sent to cambodia for example beer soft drinks and fruit juice
4073545 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4073546 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4073547 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4073548 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4073549 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4073550 a prisoner had escaped the commandant announced that 10 men would die he relished walking along the ranks this one that one as they were being marched away to the starvation bunkers number 16670 dared to step from the line i would like to take that mans place he has a wife and children who are you a priest no name no mention of fame silence the commandant dumbfounded perhaps with a fleeting thought of history kicked sergeant francis gajowniczek out of line and ordered father kolbe to go with the nine in the block of death they were ordered to strip naked and the slow starvation began in darkness but there was no screaming the prisoners sang by the eve of the assumption four were left alive the jailer came to finish kolbe off as he sat in a corner praying he lifted his fleshless arm to receive the bite of the hypodermic needle it was filled with carbolic acid they burned his body with all the others

4073557 on that 16 play drive we had probably seven or eight plays where we had the ability to change the play
4073558 thats eight more than we had the year before combined
4073559 if you go up there and youve got eight guys in the box and you only have seven people to block them it doesnt make much sense to run the ball
4073560 thats where chan getting us into one on ones with them if they are playing cover two run the ball at them thats your best chance

4073569 the government is letting down children in the more disadvantaged areas who as a result fall behind throughout their time in school

4073575 i understand they have put puryear in the controversial category
4073576 its very rare for a district court nominee to become controversial usually they just fly through
4073577 groups can attack a nominee but youll never see the nominee respond to anything except at hearings
4073578 as far as his qualifications go he was at the top of his class in law school he clerked on the u s court of appeals he has legislative experience in the u s senate he manages litigation for a big fortune 500 company and the aba american bar association rated him as qualified
4073579 gus realizes this is a lame duck year in politics
4073580 its true for all nominees whether youre in the deal or not is beyond your control
4073581 at the end of the session its who wants a bridge in vermont
4073582 im glad the judiciary committee is taking a closer look at mr puryear as a candidate because the issues we raised are legitimate issues

4073585 heinous cruel and depraved are tough words in the english language but none of these words fully express the outrage of what you will see
4073586 we learned that on the way to zamboanga corporal abeto died
4073587 his whole body was already pale when i saw him lying on the gurney at the marines camp
4073588 abeto did not die because of loss of blood he was hit in the head and back he was seriously wounded
4073589 there were reinforcements but they came really late in the day almost at the time of clearing operations

4073606 from first view one can see that there are marked differences in the vegetation of the aripo savannas in the 1800 hectors that make up the aripo savannas scientific reserve there are three distinct plant communities these are the marsh forest which consists of timite manicaria saccifera manac and the palm reale the palm marsh consisting mainly of moriche palm mauritia setigera and the fat pork crysobalanus icaco and finally the savannas it self which consists of wild cashew savanna serrett brysonima crassifolia and several grasses like paspalum there are ten natural savannas in the aripo area the soil in the aripo savannas is very infertile consisting mostly of gravels and very sandy and silty soils which layer impermeable clays the clay causes the aripo savannas to have an elevated water table which creates the hydrophitic or marsh forest which surround the natural savannas c copy write anaprice 2008 geog ia uvib

4073622 on this day x randomly selected states with no more than y electoral votes and have y rise for each day
4073623 the biggest thing that was debunked this year is that iowa and new hampshire voters have a higher level of understanding and participation in the process and thus must go first each year thats clearly out now and its time that the monopoly that these two states have had on the early process ends though it probably wont there is a lot of institutional protection around these two states
4073624 well you know i havent given a firm number and i certainly would not go above what existed under bill clinton which was the 28 percent how much of a difference is it going to be if its 20 or 25 percent they say look if its within that range then its not going to distort i think economic decision making
4073625 obama ruled out a return to capital gains tax rates of 40 percent or higher saying nobody is talking about that and he laid out the general theme of this tax plans
4073626 things i will and will not miss about the superdelegate campaign
4073627 given the strength of the euro it is very attractive for some players to head to europe for a larger take home salary than they would receive here in the us
4073628 also in the case of childress deal he can opt out after every year of his deal and pursue a contract in the nba if he chooses
4073629 by bringing international teams into the fold a restricted free agent can more effectively start a bidding war and force the hand of their current team

4073633 some teams are notorious for not paying on time or sometimes never paying at all
4073634 since there is no players association over there the players have no assurance that these clubs will pay them
4073635 did clinton rip off the european model of health care
4073636 i think obama is trying to establish a relationship with the latino community which he does not have and i think he was using kind of a shortcut so if he could use si se puede that might somehow identify him but he really does not have a relationship and people really dont know who he is and i think thats one of the big advantages that hillary clinton has because they do know her they trust her and they have confidence in her
4073637 c mo se pone a usar esa frase que tiene tanto significado cuando l no dio ni una gotita para esta lucha de nosotros los inmigrantes l no gan el merecerse usar este tema
4073638 l no se ha relacionado con los latinos y ahora quiere que la comunidad vote por l y est usando una frase como esa yo fui originaria de esa frase y sta representa muchas cosas el sacrificio de los campesinos los m rtires que tuvimos en nuestra uni n de campesinos gente golpeada y encarcelada
4073639 gee i really dont wanna get into i mean this is get over it its so old by now
4073640 we dont need the people we just need the checks
4073641 obama is a geat candidate but is america ready for a black president
4073642 ok we have a black candidate but dont we need to balance the ticket with a white male so that there is some normalicy
4073643 i am not a sexist but seeing that there are so many then women must be unelectable if we want our party to win then we must make sure that our candidates are male
4073644 ive been using two important dates one month ago and june 3rd when obama clinched the nomination
4073645 so outside of rasmussen there isnt really much evidence of clinton people moving to obama
4073646 although mr obama says he has a plan for universal health care he actually doesnt
4073647 for example the obama plan appears to contain none of the alternative energy initiatives that are in both the edwards and clinton proposals and emphasizes across the board tax cuts over both aid to the hardest hit families and help for state and local governments i know that mr obamas supporters hate to hear this but he really is less progressive than his rivals on matters of domestic policy
4073648 before last tuesday obama routinely earned around 70 of vote from democrats
4073649 hes up to 81 today clearly the party has been coming together
4073650 but an easier way to bring an end to it would have been for obama to have actually won

4073663 country music is a blend of popular musical forms originally found in the southern united states and the appalachian mountains it has roots in traditional folk music celtic music gospel music and old time music and evolved rapidly in the 1920s the term country music began to be used in the 1940s when the earlier term hillbilly music was deemed to be degrading and the term was widely embraced in the 1970s while country and western has declined in use since that time except in the united kingdom and ireland where it is still commonly used
4073664 i feel that buyers and sellers are growing tired of housing obsolescence

4073863 provocative acts conducted by the russian side itself or through satellite separatist regimes in georgia
4073864 causing mass destruction and severe damage to the civilian population and infrastructure

4073887 engkau dikaruniai hidup aku menciptakan engkau jangan sia siakan hidupmu aku memberkati engkau dengan talenta talenta untuk melayani aku tetapi engkau senantiasa menghindar aku telah menyingkapkan rahasia firman ku kepadamu tetapi pengetahuanmu tidak bertambah aku berbicara kepadamu tetapi telingamu tertutup rapat aku menunjukkan belas kasih ku kepadamu tetapi matamu tidak melihat aku mengirimkan penolong penolong bagimu tetapi engkau duduk berpangku tangan sementara mereka engkau singkirkan aku mendengarkan doa doamu dan aku telah menjawab semuanya
4073888 jika demikian mengapa engkau terus menerus mengampuni aku mengapa engkau demikian mengasihi aku

4074062 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4074063 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4074064 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4074065 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4074066 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4074067 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4074068 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4074069 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4074070 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4074071 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4074072 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4074073 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4074074 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4074075 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4074076 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4074077 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4074078 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4074079 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4074080 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4074081 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4074082 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

4074091 alas diyes y medya na ilang oras na lamang at break na natin gusto ko nang kumain
4074092 sige ikaw rin james masyado kang habang papasok sa building ng crime lab hindi maiwasan naman ni natalie ang magtanong kay detective mart nez
4074093 sa guwapo mong iyan wala ka pa ring asawa hanggang ngayon
4074094 alam mo i like you it reminds me my past girlfriend gricella
4074095 heto talagang si natalie may pagka flirt din kumekerengkeng kapag nakakakita ng guwapo
4074096 oo kaklase ko siya sa colegio de santa victoria noong nag aaral pa ako ng high school sa barcelona
4074097 walang natagpuang maaaring makatunton kay mister nice guy ang semilya na natagpuan sa bangkay ni jordan morales e sa iba nanggaling at sa pag eeksamin namin ay lumabas ang resulta na kay alex echegaray galing ang semilya na natagpuan sa katawan ni jordan morales
4074098 by the way we already knew the identity of the killer we already have documents about the personal information about mister nice guy
4074099 ano ang ibig mong sabihin hindi kay mister nice guy galing ang semilyang iyon
4074100 kay alex echegaray galing ang semilya ang ibig sabihin ba niyan e nag sex ang dalawang biktima bago sila mapatay ni mister nice guy
4074101 kung ganoon that victim jordan morales is a sumabad si james
4074102 isang macho dancer si jordan morales palagay ko isa siyang bisexual karamihan sa mga macho dancers at kolboy e bisexual because they cater the carnal needs of the homosexuals
4074103 alex echegaray and jordan morales was hired by mister nice guy to cater the carnal hunger of the latter and after being satisfied the serial killer began to kill his victims
4074104 or maybe the two men were hired by mister nice guy to perform a homosexual intercourse before killing them
4074105 maaari ring pagsamahin ang dalawa ninyong scenario nag sex muna si mister nice guy kasama ang dalawang lalaki at pagkatapos ay nagsagawa naman ng live show ang dalawang kolboy habang nanonood si mister nice guy pagkatapos ng lahat ay saka na sila pinatay ng serial killer
4074106 we can come up with more concised scenarios in our latter investigations
4074107 the cadavers commited severe punctures from his hands and feet nabalian ng buto ang mga bangkay at nangyari ito bago sila malagutan ng hininga
4074108 so binalian muna sila ng buto ni mister nice guy
4074109 hindi naman sila binalian ng buto ni mister nice guy but they acquired it during na naglalaban sila o habang patakas sa loob ng pinangyarihan ng krimen may signs na hinila ng biglaan ng killer ang paa ni alex echegaray kaya na fructure ang mga buto niya sa paa
4074110 its too much that guy must be brought into mental hospital he is already a monster psychopathic
4074111 doon naman sa mga marks na nakita natin sa kanilang mga palad kumpirmadong kahoy nga ang hawak nila particularly isang dos por dos na magaspang may nakita kaming mga salubsob sa daliri ng mga bangkay nina jordan at alex
4074112 hindi bat may nakita nga palang kalmot si james sa katawa ni alex echegaray ang hypothesis ko doon e si jordan morales ang may kagagawan noon habang nagse sex sila sa harapan ni mister nice guy
4074113 kailangang malaman natin ang pagkatao ng jordan morales na iyan lalo na ang kanyang gender baka may kinalaman din ito sa pagkakapatay sa kanya ni mister nice guy
4074114 inspector i want to see the other evidences left by mister nice guy especially the letters messages he had typewritten
4074115 natalie ipakita na natin kay detective mart nez yung mga mensahe ni mister nice guy para ma configure na natin kung sa lyrics pa ba ng kanta ni luis fonsi inihalaw ang mga mensahe niya
4074116 halika ipapakita na namin sa iyo yung mga pinaggagawa ng mokong na iyon
4074117 sa anong pamagat ng kanta ni luis fonsi hinalaw ni mister nice guy ang mensahe niya
4074118 okay this message is still an excerpt from the song quiero amarte hoy by luis fonsi
4074119 this message says that while we are traveling towards our destined paradise i will hold you tightly and never to let you go again i will give you everything just to prove that i am worthy inside your heart my body and soul is the prize just tell me that you love me too
4074120 so saang kanta naman kinuha iyan ni mister nice guy
4074121 iyan ang mensahe sa sulat na nakita namin sa bangkay nina alex at jordan
4074122 the lyrics are obvious excerpt from quiero amarte hoy it says that
4074123 how about the latest message of mister nice guy i guessed na sa kantang quiero amarte hoy rin niya hinalaw iyon
4074124 tama ka sa quiero amarte hoy din niya kinuha ito
4074125 bakit puro sa kantang quiero amarte hoy niya inihahalaw ang kanyang mga mensahe anong meron ba sa kantang iyon at anong gusto niyang ipahiwatig sa atin
4074126 baka ang kantang iyan ang nagpapaalala sa killer ng kanyang masalimuot na buhay maaaring may gustong ipahiwatig si mister nice guy sa atin at pinahihirapan lamang niya tayo sa pamamagitan ng paggamit ng kantang iyan kung susuriin niyong mabuti ang kanta maraming mga simbolo ang ginamit at matayutay ang mga pagkakagamit sa mga salita palagay ko may second meaning ang kantang ito para sa kanya
4074127 detective mart nez paki translate naman ang huling mensahe na iyan
4074128 wala akong makitang anggulo sa pagpatay ni mister nice guy at sa lyrics ng mga kanta
4074129 hindi bat ang sabi ko kanina ang kantang iyan ay maaaring nagpapaalala sa kanyang nakaraan o may ikalawang kahulugan ng kantang iyan para sa kanya
4074130 maaari ring nilalagaw lamang tayo ni mister nice guy kaya niya ginagamit ang kanta ni luis fonsi
4074131 lahat ng mga senaryo ninyo ay puwedeng mangyari but i agree most on po3 lontocs view
4074132 hes right maybe the song played a greater role on adrian or mister nice guys life when he was still in the institute he always sing luis fonsis songs especially quiero amarte hoy during adrians treatment on regression therapy he said that while he was maltreated or let us say he was sexually harrased in the jail he heard some of luis fonsis songs being played when he killed one of the inmates who molested him he again heard another song of luis fonsi and chayanne i think this is the song he heard during those times while experiencing identity crisis
4074133 anong problema ni lontoc bakit ayaw niyang sumama sa atin
4074134 nagpupursigi kasi si james na malutas agad ang kaso dahil nakapangako siya sa kanyang girlfriend na kapatid ni alex echegaray
4074135 kaya nga balang araw tinitiyak ko sa inyo na magiging heneral natin iyan
4074136 may iba pang dahilan kung bakit hindi siya sumama sa atin
4074137 psychiatrist ako kaya alam ko kung ano ang gusto nilang ipahiwatig sa pamamagitan lamang ng kanilang kilos
4074138 hindi ganoon si james kahit kailan hindi siya naging inggitero
4074139 im sorry i guess i used a wrong word should i say he hated me at first sight i think may hindi siya nagustuhan sa akin kaya ganoon na lamang ang ipinapakita niya sa akin inaamin ko naman na im imperfect but marunong din akong makahalata kung ayaw sa akin ng tao o hindi
4074140 please tell james that im sorry kung medyo nayabangan siya sa akin by the way i can be his friend
4074141 oo nga ganyan talaga si james pabago bago ng mood
4074142 mabait naman si james at madaling lapitan kung makikilala mo siya nang mas matagal mawawala ang lahat ng iyong negatibong pagtingin sa kanya
4074143 siguro over acting lang ako but i will do my best to become a good groupmate in your investigation
4074144 halika mag order na tayo nagugutom na ako may pupuntahan pa ako mamaya at baka ma late ako
4074145 anak ng telebabad ka na naman diyan ibaba mo nga iyan at kapag ako nainis sa iyo ibabawas ko ang lahat ng iyan sa suweldo mo
4074146 puro ka na lang sorry hala maglinis ka ng buong bahay at lalabas lang ako upang mag mahjong sa mga amiga ko
4074147 tanghali na siguro naman nadiligan mo na ang mga halaman sa labas kaninang umaga
4074148 matagal na akong nagtitimpi sa iyo ang kupad kupad mo isang pagkakamali mo pa tiyak sibak ka na sa akin
4074149 iyan kasi ang hirap sa iyo puro yang telepono ang hawak mo kaya napapabayaan mo na ang mga tungkulin mo dito sa bahay
4074150 sige diligan mo muna yung mga halaman bago ako umalis
4074151 ako po si detective nomar torres ng pnp may gusto lang po akong itanong sa inyo
4074152 may itatanong lang po ako tungkol kay jordan morales alex echegaray at sa babaeng nagngangalang rina
4074153 ako nga ano yung itatanong mo tungkol kina jordan alex at rina balita ko napatay kahapon sina jordz at alex
4074154 noong isang araw mga alas kuwatro ng hapon sa katunayan nagkukuwentuhan pa nga kaming tatlo nang biglang dumating si rina
4074155 pumunta si rina doon upang ipabatid yung tungkol sa kanilang sideline pagtotorero ang sabi ni rina mayroon daw silang dayuhang customer na nagpakilala lamang daw sa pangalang brock gusto raw ng brock na iyon na makapanood ng live show sa bahay nito kaya inupahan sina rina at alex lamang ngunit nagpumilit sumama si jordan natatawa nga ako kay jordan dahil panay ang buntot niya kay alex e nagdadalawang isip nga ako na baka bakla ang jordan na iyon
4074156 hindi binanggit sa akin ni rina kung saan ang eksaktong lokasyon pero ang pagkakaalam niya ay sa para aque daw
4074157 sa para aque doon namin nakita ang dalawang bangkay nina jordan at alex sa sementeryo malapit sa tramo
4074158 kutob ko malapit lang sa pinangyarihan ng krimen ang mismong serial killer kasi hindi niya makakaya pang buhatin ang dalawang bangkay isakay sa kanyang kotse at itapon sa sementeryong iyon kung malayo ang kanyang bahay
4074159 saan ko pala makikita o makakausap si rina alam mo ba ang address niya
4074160 madalas tulog si rina tuwing umaga at hapon dahil panggabi ang trabaho niya sa bar kung dadaan ka ngayon sa kanya tiyakin mong mga alas kuwatro na ng hapon dahil tiyak gising na siya nang mga oras na iyon
4074161 malapit sa riles ng tren ang bahay ni rina kung gusto mo siyang puntahan mas masahol pa ang lugar na iyon kaysa dito kung ako sa iyo tawagan mo na lang siya at magkita na lamang kayo sa kahit saan
4074162 si alex easy go lucky at saka palakaibigan kahit sa mga customer niya palagi siyang nakangiti masayahin kumbaga kaya nga mas in demand siya kaysa sa amin e
4074163 e tahimik palaging walang kibo tapos mahinhin kumilos tanging si alex nga lang ang naging best friend noon ako naman medyo ilag ako sa kanya dahil alam mo na parang nababalutan siya ng misteryo parang maraming tinatago
4074164 oo hindi nga namin alam kung saan siya nakatira e sabi naman niya sa amin noon e nangungupahan lamang siya ng kuwarto kasama ang kanyang lola nanay at bunsong kapatid na babae pero bukod doon wala na kaming alam hindi tulad ni alex na kinagigiliwan ng marami
4074165 wala ka bang napapansing kakaiba sa mga ikinikilos niya nitong mga nagdaang araw
4074166 bago siya mapatay e naging malulungkutin si jordan kahit si alex nagulat sa kanya palagi siyang wala sa sarili parang lumilipad ang utak
4074167 oo ngunit nang dumating si rina at binalitang may bagong kliyenteng nagnanais na makapanood ng live show e doon lang siya nabuhayan ng loob natatandaan ko pa ang mga ngiti niya noon parang ngiting aso
4074168 tapos noong ibinalita ni rina na mayroon siyang kliyente at isasama niya si alex ay nagpresinta si jordan na sasama rin sa kanila
4074169 ganoon na nga kasama nila akong dalawa noon nang dumating si rina
4074170 at saka sabi mo ngumiti si jordan na parang ngiting aso
4074171 pagkatapos mong sabihin sa akin iyan lalong naging misteryoso sa akin si jordan morales
4074172 si rina lang po talaga ang inyong pag asa siya ang huling kasama nina jordan at alex bago sila mapatay ni mister nice guy
4074173 pakikamusta na lamang ako kay rina kung makakausap mo siya
4074174 dumating siya rito kanina nagtatanong tungkol sa mga namaalam nating kaibigan
4074175 wala iyon abalang abala ka kasi sa trabaho mo and you need a break
4074176 tinatapos ko kasi itong mga developments ng ating imbestigasyon na isa submit ko kay chief alam mo naman ang boss namin masyadong mahilig sa urgent at bilisan mo
4074177 maraming espiya iyan at kapag nakarating sa kanya ang mga negatibong pahayag laban sa kanya e tiyak sibak ka
4074178 im sorry for that marami na rin nagsasabi sa akin ng ganyan pero i dont mean it hindi ko sinasadya
4074179 alam mo kanina gusto na kitang sapukin dahil hindi maganda ang pananalita mo kanina
4074180 sana mahuli na kaagad si mister nice guy para matigil na ang pangamba sa seguridad ng mga tao
4074181 huwag kang mag alala at mahuhuli rin natin si mister nice guy
4074182 im worried for the security of the people adrian has already evolved as a monster and we cannot stop his atrocity immediately
4074183 si natalie nasa ospital siya ngayon dahil may lalaking dinala doon na pinaniwalaang naging biktima ni mister nice guy nakaligtas ang lalaki sa hagupit ni kamatayan
4074184 ang suwerte naman niya kung ganun and he escaped that monster
4074185 ite text ko ulit si natalie kung saan ang ospital
4074186 sumabay na kayo sa akin at doon rin ako pupunta alam ko kung saang ospital
4074187 huwag muna kayong magsaya dahil mamamahinga lamang ako ng ilang araw pagbalik ko panibagong mister nice guy na ang gugulantang sa inyo
4074188 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4074189 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4074190 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4074191 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4074192 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4074193 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4074194 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4074195 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4074196 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4074197 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4074198 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4074199 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4074200 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4074201 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4074202 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4074203 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4074204 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4074205 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4074206 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4074207 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4074208 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4074209 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4074210 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4074211 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4074212 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4074213 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4074214 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4074215 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4074216 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4074217 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4074218 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4074219 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4074220 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4074221 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4074222 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4074223 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4074224 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4074225 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4074226 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4074227 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4074228 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4074229 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4074230 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4074231 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4074232 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4074233 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4074234 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4074235 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4074236 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4074237 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4074238 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4074239 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4074240 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4074241 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4074242 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4074243 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4074244 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4074245 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4074246 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4074247 who are open to doing something on the production side
4074248 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4074249 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4074250 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4074251 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4074252 i advertisement m genuinely sorry to know of all the difficulties you have had in your past but you cannot tackle these or cure them by embarking on criminal behaviour
4074253 i take the view that a custodial sentence is appropriate
4074254 she was under significant financial burden at the time and was receiving no financial support from her husband
4074255 these frauds were committed to buy groceries for the family
4074256 he was popular with everyone there are suspicions that it was weils disease following his death six of the workers went to hospital for tests
4074257 it was all the guys who had been exposed to the flood water last week and had flue like symptoms were all a bit worried
4074258 we confirm that a carillion employee has passed away the health and safety executive and police are investigating the incident and we are co operating but the cause of death has not yet been established
4074259 family are being informed and our sympathies go out to them and friends of our colleague
4074260 some of the managers paid a visit and decided to close down everyone has now left except for me
4074261 there are no suspicious circumstances although a post mortem will establish the cause of death
4074262 we are aware of the incident and police are investigating
4074263 we just dont feel that there is such a parking problem here
4074264 any problem that there may be has been imposed by the councils blind determination to impose this policy its making it harder for people to get into the city to work and to shop its basically just a tax its not really helping parking for anyone
4074265 theres an environmental issue too because its going to encourage people with gardens to dig them up and put a driveway in which will have a drastic effect on the history and the feel of the place
4074266 the situation has got worse over the last six months
4074267 i think its a good idea despite the inconvenience of not being able to park within half a mile of your own front door unless you are very lucky
4074268 the over crowding results in illegal and unsafe parking which is a danger to children and old people crossing roads
4074269 to assert that there is not a problem is simply misleading
4074270 there are no formal plans at the moment to extend the cpz and the council is just looking for feedback in order to decide whether to bring forward more parking zones
4074271 there is no desire at all to impose an unwanted scheme upon the residents
4074272 the council will collate the responses they have and put them to the transport infrastructure and environment committee in september and at that point they will decide
4074273 the initial plans were very optimistic and there were delays in earlier stages neither of which we can do much about now
4074274 nor can we alter the international economic situation and we have to take account of changes in the housing market what we can do and are doing is revising our business plan
4074275 despite falling house sales the new homes at craigmillar have exceeded all expectations since first hitting the market
4074276 the current economic climate poses serious challenges to wels development strategy for granton
4074277 unfortunately wels plans have been shaken by the credit crunch however by amending our plans and looking at new avenues to secure investment we have made 4 million from land sales
4074278 this has been a terrifying ordeal for the man involved
4074279 we know there were a number of people in the area at the time and are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident
4074280 this was an unprovoked attack which left the victim with serious injuries and we are anxious to speak to anyone with any information
4074281 we know that there were two members of the public who came to the victims aid and we are keen to speak to them
4074282 anyone else who witnessed the incident or who recognises the description of the suspect is also urged to get in touch
4074283 people use the word a lot but i really do believe that jenners is an institution
4074284 it means a great deal to the people of edinburgh weve got a fantastic historical store but it is a bit outmoded and we really wanted to maintain that tradition but with a modern twist
4074285 our customer is still very much steeped in that history
4074286 we want to retain that tradition and heritage and it will always be jenners but now its jenners a house of fraser store
4074287 i know people dont like change but some things because they are outmoded we do have to change
4074288 jenners was the ultimate shopping destination in recent years it did lose its touch but so too have most retailers
4074289 out of all the stores in edinburgh i still think jenners is the best in terms of offering and customer service marks amp spencer is now thin on the ground with staff while other stores have a self service image
4074290 i do think jenners lost its way along the road but its not indicative of a problem with just jenners but more a change in trends from then to now
4074291 its exciting to hear that jenners are having a revamp maybe they will steal john lewis crown
4074292 i think maybe for a while jenners was in the fashion wilderness in terms of the high end of what young people wanted
4074293 i think its maybe had a bit of a shove since the opening of harvey nichols as well
4074294 i think they are doing well in terms of carrying brands that are unique to it and i think it still does attract the older customer that will always go there for tea and a wee look around and thats really important
4074295 it has been a long project and i had to stop going out to the congo during the civil war there in the mid 90s
4074296 i have had malaria on a number of occasions which is a big risk out there and was quite bad but it is all worth it
4074297 on this last trip alone we collected over 20 species that have never been recorded in the congo before
4074298 the biggest difficult is the sweat bee which is very much like a midge except it doesnt bite instead it swarms everywhere getting in your eyes and ears up your nose and it can quickly become unbearable insect repellent doesnt work and we did what the locals do roll up leaves and put them in your ears
4074299 we are studying the behaviour of the congos larger animals and for years we have seen the different plants they eat but have had no way of identifying them
4074300 we have agreed a fee with arsenal and we have now been given permission to speak to justin which we will be doing in the next 24 48 hours
4074301 it looks as if there will be no honest competition for my position
4074302 medicals dont take 10 minutes these days and we have to wait 24 hours for the results
4074303 however we expect the formalities to be completed in time for him to be available for selection for the fulham match
4074304 wenn einer ins amt k me der die w hler so an der nase herumgef hrt hat dann w re das ein skandal f r diese republik
4074305 liefe es darauf hinaus mit den linken eine absprache zu treffen

4074369 this bulletin paints a picture of wide discrepancy between the number of men who take are treated or even die from drug use compared with the number of women
4074370 the fact more than 1 500 people died due to drug use in 2006 is extremely saddening in itself but the fact so many of these deaths are male raises many questions about gender and drug misuse
4074371 its slightly ahead of last year but the proportion of applications is up as well my guess is that there will still be 30 000 students placed through the clearing process

4074388 waduhhh memalukan sekali aku ini di usia tua kok tambah ngaco
4074389 ayolah frank sekarang giliranmu cerita dong apa saat yang paling tak enak bagimu dulu
4074390 aku besar di san pedro ayahku seorang nelayan dan ia cinta amat pada lautan ia punya kapalnya sendiri meski berat sekali mencari mata pencaharian di laut ia kerja keras sekali dan akan tetap tinggal di laut sampai ia menangkap cukup ikan untuk memberi makan keluarga bukan cuma cukup buat keluarga kami sendiri tapi juga untuk ayah dan ibunya dan saudara saudara lainnya yang masih dirumah
4074391 ahhh seandainya kalian sempat bertemu ayahku ia sosoknya besar orangnya kuat dari menarik jala dan memerangi lautan demi mencari ikan asal kau dekat saja padanya wuih bau dia sudah mirip kayak lautan ia gemar memakai mantel cuaca buruk tuanya yang terbuat dari kanvas dan pakaian kerja dengan kain penutup dadanya topi penahan hujannya sering ia tarik turun menutupi alisnya tak perduli berapapun ibuku mencucinya tetap akan tercium bau lautan dan amisnya ikan
4074392 kalau cuaca buruk ia akan antar aku ke sekolah ia punya mobil truk tua yang dipakainya dalam usaha perikanan ini truk itu bahkan lebih tua umurnya daripada ayahku bunyinya meraung dan berdentangan sepanjang perjalanan sejak beberapa blok jauhnya kau sudah bisa mendengarnya saat ayah bawa truk menuju sekolah aku merasa menciut ke dalam tempat duduk berharap semoga bisa menghilang hampir separuh perjalanan ayah sering mengerem mendadak dan lalu truk tua ini akan menyemburkan suatu kepulan awan asap ia akan selalu berhenti di depan sekali dan kelihatannya setiap orang akan berdiri mengelilingi dan menonton lalu ayah akan menyandarkan diri ke depan dan memberiku sebuah ciuman besar pada pipiku dan memujiku sebagai anak yang baik aku merasa agak malu begitu risih maklumlah aku sebagai anak umur dua belas dan ayahku menyandarkan diri kedepan dan menciumi aku selamat tinggal
4074393 aku ingat hari ketika kuputuskan aku sebenarnya terlalu tua untuk suatu kecupan selamat tinggal
4074394 tidak lama setelah itu ayah pergi melaut dan tidak pernah kembali lagi itu terjadi pada suatu hari ketika sebagian besar armada kapal nelayan merapat dipelabuhan tapi kapal ayah tidak ia punya keluarga besar yang harus diberi makan kapalnya ditemukan terapung dengan jala yang separuh terangkat dan separuhnya lagi masih ada dilaut pastilah ayah tertimpa badai dan ia mencoba menyelamatkan jala dan semua pengapung pengapungnya
4074395 kawan kawan kalian tak bisa bayangkan apa yang akan kukorbankan sekedar untuk mendapatkan lagi sebuah ciuman pada pipiku untuk merasakan wajah tuanya yang kasar untuk mencium bau air laut dan samudra padanya untuk merasakan tangan dan lengannya merangkul leherku ahh sekiranya saja aku jadi pria dewasa saat itu kalau aku seorang pria dewasa aku pastilah tidak akan pernah memberi tahu ayahku bahwa aku terlalu tua tuk sebuah ciuman selamat tinggal

4074434 none of my friends would have imagined me as an activist
4074435 they told me that even though i was an american citizen the chinese government doesnt recognize dual citizenship so i have no rights as an american by traveling on my taiwanese documents in china the chinese authorities have the right to detain me and to subject me to the full extent of chinese law
4074436 it was scary because they warned me if i was low profile now i will be high profile and i will be followed once i enter tibetan regions
4074437 but i felt that i couldnt let my fear stop me
4074438 the further west i went the more intense it got until i was very very scared
4074439 the local tibetans told me that these police stations had sprung up after the protests in march if theres a way to instill fear in people this is the way to do it youre not going to go out in the street and protest when you see fifty armed police to the left and right of you
4074440 my heart doesnt feel right if his photo isnt up somewhere
4074441 if you put up a photo in a temple that act cant necessarily be traced back to you but wearing a pendant is a very personal thing the tibetans take so many risks for this small freedom
4074442 it was really difficult for me to hear what they had to say the spectrum is just so far apart from what the tibetans believe and what the chinese believe the chinese say we developed this region we built these roads look at that hospital when you confront them with the bad things they focus on the good things they would say we referring to me as well i wanted to scream no no im not chinese they get to send their kids to school for free because theyre in a minority region and they make more money there but it really seems theyre taking over the economy and pushing tibetans further aside id heard about this id read about it id even talked about it but it wasnt until i was there that i could feel what occupation was actually like
4074443 theres a good reason that foreigners arent allowed in these places it looks like a war zone in kardze the police are in the middle of the sidewalks theyre sitting in helmets holding their guns and riot shields in rows of 10 or 15 they are outside convenience stores under blue tarps every half a block on both sides of the road watching theyre up on raised metal posts with cutout windows watching i couldnt walk anywhere without dozens of armed police staring at me ive never seen so many police and military personnel in one town in my life nor have i experienced this kind of heart pounding fear before
4074444 we must create more battlefields and united battle fronts each leader must re educate re plan pre olympics stability work and strictly prevent any incidents from happening
4074445 i cant imagine anyone protesting here any more because as soon as they do anything suspicious theyll be swept away we talk about freedom of speech but when youre under such heavy surveillance you cant even think about saying anything that these armed police dont want you to say
4074446 no theyre here to protect us why should we be scared
4074447 if the tibetans went wild and pulled out their swords again then these police would keep them in line
4074448 as soon as i arrived i went to check my email at an internet cafe i opened something from google notifications and found a message in broken english
4074449 were trying to promote awareness and dialogue about whats going on in tibet by raising tibetan flags worldwide id been in contact with people in dharamsala about the campaign its just become a part of the dialogue after i received this email from google i seriously considered going back for the first time i seriously feared for my safety it was such a foreign feeling because i grew up in minnesota where i could say whatever i want read whatever i want and write whatever i want without thinking anything of it and all of a sudden this freedom was taken away and i was always looking over my shoulder if its something you grew up with you dont think oh im so lucky because i can write whatever i want today or im so lucky because i can log onto whatever website i want today this isnt just about tibet this is about a sixth of the world that dont even know what theyre missing because state propaganda is just that good
4074450 they pounded and yelled at every single door until they got to mine they looked around the room and warned me if you do anything suspicious therell be consequences after they left i was shaking
4074451 i was chain smoking by this point the combination of the email the hotel raid and the tense atmosphere was emotionally draining i honestly dont know how people live in that kind of fear
4074452 its quite a steep climb and i went all the way to the rooftop from there you get a panoramic view of kardze these regions are really beautiful you can see the valley the distant grasslands and the snow capped mountains in the background that surround the town so i took pictures but i couldnt help myself i took a few zoomed in shots of the military base i didnt know that i was playing with fire
4074453 i thought this is it i cant believe i took those pictures
4074454 it was very intimidating i kept asking them whats wrong whats going on all they would say was wait and see i kept thinking wait and see for what
4074455 the first thing they did was look through the photos on my camera of course they found the shots of the military camp they started whispering to each other i said im sorry i take pictures of everything look at the photos of the mountains and the valleys and the houses but i knew i was in a lot of trouble
4074456 they flipped through my journal and filmed everything every sheet of paper that i had front and back i told them im going back to chengdu tomorrow morning look heres my bus ticket but they said were going to return your bus ticket and take you to kangding for further investigation apparently it wasnt in their jurisdiction to process my case where we were i kept telling them i need to call the us embassy but they very simply clarified you are a chinese citizen traveling in china on your chinese documents youll be prosecuted according to chinese law i didnt have any rights as an american at that point
4074457 china throws human rights activists into prison i remembered a documentary id seen in which one of chinas top lawyers said that he lost 99 of his cases dealing with human rights activists it takes months even years for people to even get a trial in china
4074458 id heard first hand testimonies for years from tibetan former political prisoners nuns getting electric cattle prods inserted into their vaginas people told to stand barefoot on blocks of ice and then pushed off an hour later so that the skin of their heels would peel off monks who have to use plastic cups because the electric shocks caused so much nerve damage to their fingers that they keep dropping glasses i never imagined that id be in a position where it was conceivable that id receive that kind of treatment
4074459 that hard drive contained photos of me speaking in front of tibetan flags me handing out tibetan flags me waving tibetan flags press releases that had my name under the header co founder of the raise tibetan flags campaign the whole raise tibetan flags campaign website that i put together from illustrator they could see everything ive been doing for the last few years
4074460 they saw my long face and that i wasnt eating
4074461 i was in the back seat in between two police officers a tibetan policewoman who kept regurgitating patriotic communist propaganda and the officer who had arrested me
4074462 all sorts of things kept drifting in and out of my head if they gave me 15 years id be 39 when i was released i wondered how many years it would take before id want to kill myself how would i do it id read about people killing themselves underneath their blankets and i wondered how they managed it it was the first time in my life that i actually thought about committing suicide
4074463 i meet these people in dharamsala all the time the hippies who smoke indian cigarettes and dont wear shoes because they love nature i decided that i was going to be tree hugging buddhist seeker wen i couldnt tell them the truth if i did i would be exposing a lot of people and i would be sending myself to prison
4074464 he was older than the others in his forties gray hair also not in uniform he was really nice to me but i got the feeling that he wasnt nice to everyone during the interrogation i became hippie wen when he asked me if id ever been to dharamsala i said oh yes i went to take the vipassana meditation course where for ten days i didnt speak to anyone at all and we werent even allowed to look anyone in the eyes this was all from stuff id heard from other people in all the years ive been coming to dharamsala ive never found the time to take a meditation course
4074465 i went into great detail about meditating in the indian himalayas how it really spoke to me and how spiritually developed i became
4074466 what do you think you would discover if you really looked into yourself and listened to your heart this made him laugh really loudly all communist officials are required to be atheist theyre not supposed to have any religion
4074467 ive never been good at lying or being put on the spot but i wasnt nervous at all if i needed more time to think about a question i would pick out specific chinese words and ask what does that mean again because they knew i grew up in the us and that my chinese isnt perfect or in my answer i would use an english word and say what is that in chinese when they asked me about the photographs i took i went into length about the magic of photography and composition and capturing the perfect subject i guess it was a pretty good performance because they seemed to believe me
4074468 i told them that i recently broke up with my boyfriend and it was just too hard to keep in contact with him so i decided to cancel my email account altogether
4074469 they told me well just take a quick look through your stuff again and then well send you back to your hotel in chengdu
4074470 i wanted them to feel guilty about putting me away i wanted to show them that im not a bad person and that i dont deserve to go to prison they gave me cigarettes and told me how much they envied me for being so young and having traveled all over the world they kept asking me questions about america what my parents were like things like that i asked them the same kinds of questions how old they were their kids names the female officer played me a britney spears song on her pink cell phone and had me guess which one it was i got it right it was oops i did it again we were all just hanging out laying on the bed or sitting in the recliner like we were on a road trip
4074471 four and a half hours later someone came in and said lets go
4074472 they actually looked worried as i was being swept away with these other officers i kept asking them you guys arent coming with me on the drive i kept asking questions to try to figure out what was going on i even straight up asked them can i relax am i really out of trouble you wouldnt lie to me would you all they would say is we were told to take to you to chengdu you know what you did wrong that wasnt very reassuring
4074473 i instantly perked up why would he ask me where my hotel was if he wasnt going to take me to it on august 1st last year 2007 i was driving on a bridge and it fell down it was the 35w bridge in minneapolis my car fell 60 feet landed upside down and 13 people died that was at 6 pm when i went to the impound lot the guy hugged me because hed been sure i was dead by the looks of my car and here i was at 6 pm august 1st 2008 facing another miracle escape after chinese police had found everything they needed to convict me everything that they put people away for they hadnt asked me a single question about it i couldnt comprehend it
4074474 i was thinking please just give me back my passport but i went to dinner with them even though i didnt have an appetite

4074477 human rights in tibet have to begin with human rights in china its very unlikely that human rights in tibet are going to improve on their own since im ethnically chinese i feel like this is what i need to work on im not a superstitious person but part of me feels that ive been given more than just a chance to do this work and that this is now the purpose of my life
4074478 nobody should be fooled by hsuss paltry gesture while pretending to be part of the solution the group continues to be a significant part of the problem an over zealous social movement bent on extending legal rights to animals whether or not thinking people like the consequences the entire community of santa cruz is learning this week what can happen when human beings resist the sort of evolution the animal rights community has planned for them and its not pretty
4074479 we are excited about this new agreement because we believe it will lead to less turn over in the shop which will result in long term workers and union members

4074483 over the past few weeks athletes have been reaching personal bests in the gym as well as on the track in training which bodes well for beijing
4074484 jamie is an impressive athlete at 35 and with 18 years or so of gym work behind him youd expect the gains he can make in the gym to plateau however over the past year hes made gains of around 10 15 increase in both strength and power
4074485 the squad are extremely competitive and the games have added to that this year jamie had a fantastic personal best at the world championships earlier this year of 17 27 and like the rest of the squad has been peaking at the right time
4074486 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine

4074501 when i was a boy in england long ago people who traveled on trains with dogs had to pay for a dog ticket
4074502 the very same encounter appeared as a cartoon in punch in 1869 the caption of the cartoon reads
4074503 station master say mum as cats is dogs and rabbits is dogs and sos parrots but this ere tortis is a insect so there aint no charge for it
4074504 thanks to nicholas humphrey and michael jackson for letters informing me of the 1869 punch cartoon about tortoises and dogs on trains my memory of traveling with a tortoise has two possible explanations the first and more probable is that i heard of the conversation recorded in the punch cartoon and transformed it over the years into a memory this would not be the first time that i remembered something that never happened memories of childhood recollected in old age are notoriously unreliable the second possible explanation is that the memory is accurate in that case the conductor on the train knew the cartoon and said what he was supposed to say according to the script
4074505 here are several overlapping definitions for confabulation inventing things that arent true making up something thats thought to be true for a variety of reasons one being to fill in memory gaps inventing something thats hoped to be true imagining that something happened to you after hearing a report or reading a story about someone else manufacturing deliberately or not a portion of reality arriving at a fabricated story and just plain lying

4074530 pointed out that leaders at all levels must deeply understand that the struggle against the three forces is one of life or death
4074531 in xinjiang the fight against separatist forces is long term arduous and complex
4074532 stick to a strategy of seizing the initiative to strike pre emptively closely guard against and attack separatist sabotage by the three forces and never allow our enemies to gain strength

4074543 i am delighted to endorse the work of the gareth butler history trust the trusts aims of giving school children from poorer backgrounds the same kinds of experiences as children from affluent backgrounds is both laudable and progressive children need a good grounding in our countrys history especially the history of conflict only by understanding the past can we navigate our collective future i am sure the gbht will be a fitting and living memorial to gareth and there will be hundreds of kids who never knew him who will have good cause to thank him
4074544 i am delighted to be able to support the new gareth butler history trust we know that cultural and educational activities outside the classroom can have a huge impact on a childs development and this trust will enable all young people to take advantage of the benefits school trips can offer
4074545 this is an immensely worthwhile venture which i am sure would have had gareths passionate support it will bring history and the agonies of history to life in a vivid way for young people who might not otherwise have the chance to visit great historic sites and it will create memories and experiences for them that will remain for the rest of their lives
4074546 we zijn nu drie weken bezig en daarin hebben alle spelers kanse n gekregen
4074547 in sommige gevallen heeft dat tot nieuwe inzichten geleid daarom hebben we maandag duidelijkheid gegeven aan een groep spelers de transfertermijn sluit aan het einde van de maand we verwachten dat er nog wel wat gaat gebeuren met een aantal spelers van ons

4074553 if were getting drugs that are not of quality were not going to get the results that we require
4074554 further tests are being conducted on the stability of these products
4074555 we are concerned that the recall will undermine public faith in the quality and safety of medicines and are worried about the potential impact that the recall will have on the availability of life saving arv medications
4074556 at school it was the worst that was the worst pain i had
4074557 i was bullied quite a lot by other pupils even by a teacher i was bullied quite severely
4074558 i wouldnt eat at school in the end i went in to school for my exams and came home
4074559 i couldnt cope with the pressure of being in that environment i was constantly under stress
4074560 when people called me fat it would make me eat more it didnt spur me on to lose weight
4074561 i was at a family party and a family friend had lost 2st 7lbs dieting and that spurred me on
4074562 also i was in a clothes store and that was the only store i would go in because i knew they stocked larger sizes
4074563 their larger size was too tight and i thought im either going to have to have clothes specially made or im going to get stuck in the house constantly and i wont be able to go out and enjoy things with friends
4074564 the hardest part for me wasnt actually giving up the food it was admitting i had a problem and going along to the group
4074565 when youre young and when youre a man going to a slimming group it can be quite a daunting thing
4074566 you think about tv shows you see and its all a joke or its full of older women talking about diets and things you can and cant have
4074567 you gradually start off following the plan you fit five minutes of exercise in whenever you like through the day
4074568 you build that up over time and now i walk five miles a night with my mum
4074569 my confidence and self esteem has gone way up before it was nonexistent

4074573 i dont think that people are always watching me and judging me
4074574 the lovers of romance can go elsewhere for satisfaction but where can the lovers of truth turn if not to history
4074575 the idea of a model health certificate is not a bad idea in itself but its just impossible to police and to govern
4074576 thats why it hasnt been implemented at this stage because theres just no way of doing it
4074577 whos to say that a girl who gets this certificate lets say its valid for a year isnt going to be ok in six months time or a years time you just dont know
4074578 the british fashion council have stepped away from one of the fundamental recommendations of the model health inquiry
4074579 fashion is fantastic it can be wonderful but there are some aspects of it that are still actually quite toxic
4074580 one of the fundamental questions that neuroscientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons to the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms and whole animals
4074581 this project gives us a really useful and unique opportunity to look at something that may exhibit whole behaviours but still remains closely tied to the activity of individual neurons
4074582 we discovered that recycling is actually an incredibly complicated and stressful activity which requires a huge amount of concentration
4074583 the whole process is so confusing that even hardened and dedicated recyclers still get it wrong

4074588 whilst not all non native species are harmful many pose real problems to our native wildlife to boaters and to our historic channels locks and bridges
4074589 with no natural predators to control them they can overwhelm wildlife channels banks and towpaths
4074590 this is very costly and diverts resources that could be used elsewhere on the waterway network
4074591 we are therefore asking people to help us by disposing of non native plants safely and carefully selecting alternative plants for gardens ponds and aquariums

4074616 our one day series in india finishes on december 2 so in theory specialist odi players could take part i would not expect that players selected for the test series which follows the odi series would be able to take part in the champions league as it would clash with the first test and a three day warm up game leading up to it
4074617 was characterized by decreasing household final consumption expenditure and smaller fixed capital formation
4074618 clearly the growth dip in spring could have been worse
4074619 for the second half of this year we believe in moderate and clearly below potential growth but not in an outright recession

4074623 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4074624 its the first bright news for traders in the oil market in a while
4074625 the dramatic drop off in commodities and specifically oil has been well overdone in my view
4074626 they still think the u s is the epicenter of the world economy
4074627 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isnt the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india
4074628 since then the greenback has improved by 6 9 percent
4074629 we are pumping gas again into the south caucasus pipeline
4074630 the baku supsa pipeline remains suspended for the time being it goes through the middle of the country
4074631 its a different route from scp so were still assessing the security implications and that remains suspended
4074632 while the conflict in georgia may have been the of attention for us the most significant supply event was the attack on the btc line in turkey and the implication that it may continue to be a target and one the length of which makes it virtually impossible to defend comfortably
4074633 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key
4074634 hurricane elene rotating ominously in the gulf of mexico for two days suddenly and unexpectedly and to the delight of floridians turned left
4074635 so far nothing will change the situation because investors are expecting chinas economy to slow in the next two years
4074636 institutional investors have been cautious because they werent fully convinced that the u s economic slowdown would affect china but now they get it
4074637 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4074638 due to the tight situation in the global plant construction sector which has caused price increases for individual works
4074639 demand for our steel products remains very pleasing as reflected in continued price increases fully confirming our expectations of another good steel year
4074640 the growth was again driven mainly by china with an increase of almost 10 percent in the european union output was at the prior year level

4074670 if the fsa adopted limits on speculation you would see the price of gasoline drop in the united kingdom

4074674 we have had no problems at all hes a good neighbour
4074675 i think he has planted well hes put some really well established trees in the new trees are standing at 15 foot already its incredibly close to the road but once the trees have grown i should not think it will be a problem

4074677 it is a matter of taste it is a fairly contemporary building it is a pavilion and garden there is a mixed bag of styles on that road
4074678 theres no money for training facilities or even kits coming in because sefton is classed as a high net worth area they need somewhere to come and excel in their sport
4074679 i thought well if im buying the kit i may as well buy the club im sick of waiting for people to put their hands in their pockets
4074680 the money even a single multi function all weather sports centre could generate is considerable
4074681 but i want to make clear that were not going to be making a penny out of this business ourselves from profit wages or anything else we will have open access to the accounts and will be very very transparent
4074682 the plans need tweaking one of the first things we need to do is go back to the planning process and work on whats been approved so far
4074683 were looking at various options and trying to take as much advice as we can at the moment
4074684 but its such a good location weve a great artery for transport good access to the rest of sefton and west lancashire and no residential neighbours
4074685 if road safety is a concern for the planners theres no reason why we cant start a minibus shuttle service into formby village

4074689 well have the first team and a youth team who are also very good
4074690 apart from that i dont care if another adult never sets foot in here
4074691 we want to give the kids a decent number of all weather pitches which are in massive demand around here as well as the opportunity to practice as many other sports as possible
4074692 weve installed a very talented general manager in mel grice everyone answers to her
4074693 in the last two weeks we have invested in initial improvements such as paving the perimeter of the ground weve a new minibus arriving in a couple of weeks therell be a new car park and a refurbished press box
4074694 and already weve dragged out a profit of 2 500
4074695 in the past it has been run too much as a football club and not enough as a business the bottom line is weve got to have more money coming in than going out
4074696 but better connected to the wider football community than hughs family and we will certainly use that to try and jump the queue in realising our plans
4074697 all the police need to do to make a determination of a breach in a story is to read it we took all reasonable steps to ensure we complied with the court ordered publication ban
4074698 i was more nervous than i have been for a while i started thinking that this might be my last olympics
4074699 i am disappointed with the way i swam being the racer i am i did expect a little bit more
4074700 in my heart of hearts i knew i couldnt get a medal although i had hoped to make the finals or semi finals
4074701 walking round with the flag was in a sense the medal i missed
4074702 well fix that but that comes from not playing together all the time
4074703 we had one starter since football started so we dont have as many players here
4074704 were playing basically the guys who are going to make up our bench this year and theyre playing pretty well and i was real happy with their performance
4074705 i think were going to be a real quick team
4074706 were not very big because we have a lot of kids that are between 6 foot 2 and 6 foot 4 but well be able to play a lot of good man to man defense be aggressive and get up and down the court
4074707 i think were going to be a lot better this year
4074708 i like how a lot of the kids have played and its been a very successful summer
4074709 they dont necessarily play smart all the time but they play hard and i like this group of kids
4074710 weve had 16 to 17 kids showing up for everything all summer so we have been subbing in fives and were able to build up our bench that way
4074711 i think were going to be a pretty good team this year
4074712 he played for me as a freshman last year on varsity and i think he is going to be really good this year
4074713 he can shoot the ball from outside and take the ball to the basket when he needs to we just need to work on his defensive skills to help make him a better all around player and we should be fine
4074714 they make a lot of noise in early a m
4074715 any help will be appreciated i already hear them i dont want to smell them too
4074716 the sounds of gnawing scratching and running can be heard throughout the night
4074717 this issue should have been resolved long ago as this is not conducive to a healthy living environment
4074718 i am sleeping at my parents house tonight because this is an untenable situation
4074719 but if we issue a violation when the tenant is there and then the tenant moves the unit cant be rerented until we give the ok
4074720 while i was there i noticed her gas fired space heater in the living room with the vent falling out of the wall
4074721 i asked if she planned on using that for heat and she said she was afraid to
4074722 the opening is big enough that we can see the bathtub from the unit above
4074723 i have had to bathe my children in the kitchen sink and i only take brief showers because i am frightened that the bathtub from above might fall
4074724 the fixtures were supposed to be replaced also and have not been done
4074725 i now need to use a wrench to adjust the water
4074726 mr gauthier told me to get off his ass which i had pretty much had enough of his verbal abuse and promptly hung up on him
4074727 i realize there is probably not much we can do about this
4074728 but i do know that every time we deal with anyone from this particular company they are always rude is it possible to pass on that its not necessary to be rude and we wouldnt be calling if it wasnt an emergency
4074729 i just wish i didnt have to send the letter
4074730 i believe he has been given ample time to take care of his responsibilities
4074731 i went to grab a jacket and i noticed it smelled like mold
4074732 because it would leak when you couldnt hear the water running
4074733 its like anything you buy you pay for something and you expect good service
4074734 we have agreed a fee with arsenal and we have now been given permission to speak to justin which we will be doing in the next 24 48 hours
4074735 medicals dont take 10 minutes these days and we have to wait 24 hours for the results

4074757 we hebben de architect van de jonker gevraagd eens te kijken naar de mogelijkheden en de kosten van het aanpassen van de gevels zegt directeur eugene kraan van mozaiek wonen

4074759 lo sentimos nos estamos tomando un receso etc etc etc
4074760 this bulletin paints a picture of wide discrepancy between the number of men who take are treated or even die from drug use compared with the number of women
4074761 the fact more than 1 500 people died due to drug use in 2006 is extremely saddening in itself but the fact so many of these deaths are male raises many questions about gender and drug misuse
4074762 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4074763 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4074764 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4074765 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4074766 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4074767 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4074768 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4074769 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4074770 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4074771 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4074772 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4074773 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4074774 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4074775 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4074778 the primary focus is to tell latino stories to a national audience that often sees the world in black and white terms
4074779 were really trying to focus on telling deeper stories than what you hear in the media
4074780 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4074781 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4074782 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4074783 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4074784 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4074785 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4074786 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

4074788 i was beaten severely by my husband because he saw me with female condoms yet i got them from the district hospital with the aim of showing them to him he said i was a prostitute and he will never take me back now i have nothing to feed my six children
4074789 there should have been intensive public campaigns on female condoms for our male folks to know that we now have this product that way our families would have been saved
4074790 the issue is that manufacturers of fc2 took into consideration such issues as people wearing the inside ring on the wrist and reduced the size of the ring that it is difficult to wear it on the wrist so this issue has been taken into consideration

4074825 an entire generation of young men including those from middle class families is growing up shunning work and seeing crime as a shortcut to wealth and success
4074826 why one boy asked me was i worried about his grades at school when he might not live long enough to get a job this is the world of get rich or die trying

4074830 we should not see this handover as a loss for nigeria or as a sign of weakness but our profound respect for international law and good neighbourliness
4074831 this handing over process as painful as it is for everyone including the president is a commitment we have made to the international community and we have a responsibility to keep it
4074832 i guess its going to be me and ryan in the middle tomorrow
4074833 its fine its all i wanted to do tomorrow is going to be the real battle
4074834 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
4074835 thats what im going to be focusing on over the next three days
4074836 at 8 30 we were on a bus to here the water cube then we did some stretching and warm ups for 30 40 minutes then he puts on his suit and does more warm ups
4074837 then he swims he always has a massage then hell eat take a nap and then come back on the bus and do it all again usually twice a day
4074838 hes doing very well hes handling his work schedule and other things are going exceedingly well

4074843 la raz n para la escalada fueron los incesantes ataques contra aldeas georgianas por parte de osetia en las ltimas dos semanas el lado georgiano pidi varias veces a las fuerzas de paz rusas que intervinieron pero ellos no hicieron nada y no fue posible detener a los ossetios sin atacarlos es por eso que el ej rcito georgiano ingres en la zona del conflicto a fin de detener la agresi n y restablecer el orden constitucional en la regi n
4074844 en cuanto a estados unidos ellos quieren tener acceso a territorio georgiano por diferentes razones una es el tr nsito de petr leo y gas y segundo establecer una base militar para el ej rcito estadounidense en caso de un ataque contra ir n y para ubicar radares o sistemas antimisiles
4074845 somos castigados por nuestra aspiraci n a volvernos parte de un mundo democr tico hoy nuestra opci n hacia occidente est amenazada la agresi n rusa es un desaf o para la comunidad internacional y cada minuto es cr tico para las vidas de civiles inocentes

4074850 the global distribution of the highly pathogenic h5n1 avian influenza has caused the world health organization to show its profound concern regarding the possibility of the virus spreading from human to human in the future
4074851 furthermore the development of resistance to two approved anti influenza drugs oseltamivir relenza as well as the lack of adequate vaccines has increased the need of developing new antiviral drugs consequently i am delighted to be involved in the preclinical research stage of this innovative antiviral candidate and look forward to continuing our successful collaboration with canopus biopharma in this area
4074852 the results of our study suggest that a statin caffeine combination may be a viable treatment or preventative against influenza virus infections
4074853 the synergistic statin caffeine combination investigated through the study effectively lessened lung damage and inhibited viral replication in animal models for the h5n1 h3n2 and h1n1 influenza viruses
4074854 with these findings we will aggressively continue the development of statc
4074855 its clear that theres significant global need for a superior low cost and plentiful alternative in the fight against various forms of increasingly harmful influenzas
4074856 it is possible that higher doses of statin than those used in this study may result in even greater efficacy statc also appeared to be more effective when administered preventatively
4074857 we are also motivated at the potential of this compound in comparison with other currently available anti influenza medications its clear that there is significant global need for a superior low cost and plentiful alternative in the fight against influenza
4074858 as fdr himself once said repetition does not transform a lie into a truth that statement is as true today as it was when social security was created 73 years ago just because those who are fundamentally opposed to social security continue to say its a failed program doesnt mean its true social security is not bankrupt and not in crisis however it has been under attack our members hope a new congress and a new president will put washingtons focus back where it should be preserving social security for future generations not dismantling the program through privatization
4074859 national committee members do not believe america cant afford social security we know the truth is our nation cant afford not to have the safety net social security has provided and continues to provide for millions of retirees the disabled and their families as we celebrate social securitys anniversary and prepare for another election day candidates should remember that millions of americans are counting on the guarantee of social security not the risk of private accounts
4074860 after a very long wait americans can now be confident that their genetic information cannot be used by health insurers or employers in harmful or hurtful ways
4074861 our challenge now is to make sure that doctors and patients are aware of these new protections so that fear of discrimination never again stands in the way of a decision to take a genetic test that could save a life
4074862 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
4074863 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4074864 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
4074865 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
4074866 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
4074867 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
4074868 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
4074869 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep
4074870 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
4074871 under current law it is not possible to procure a transplantable heart after cardiac death
4074872 whether or not any such legal changes come to pass any successfully transplanted heart cannot have come from a person who was declared dead on the basis of irreversible stoppage of the heart
4074873 flying around all day to find nectar and pollen from flowers is hard work so it makes sense that bees are more likely to respond to the pheromone when honey reserves are low
4074874 spacecraft instrumentation cannot perform critical measurements such as precise radiometric age dating sophisticated stable isotopic analyses and definitive life detection assays
4074875 the papers in this collection complement each other to give a fairly comprehensive view of the achievements and issues in this area
4074876 globally xdr tb has resulted from a combination of poor tb control practices poor adherence to medications inappropriate use of second line drugs lack of laboratory capacity to culture tb or assess drug susceptibility and high hiv prevalence
4074877 in order to prevent an escalation in xdr tb we need to ensure adherence to the cornerstones of tb management which include directly observed therapy isolation of infectious cases and contact investigations we also need to institute routine rapid and standardized methods to assess drug susceptibility of tb isolates
4074878 anyway i wanted to let you all know that i am doing better than i have in years
4074879 we now have a dedicated debt service which was created in response to the increase in demand from people experiencing severe financial problems
4074880 we dealt with 16 008 new debt issues involving 7 million pounds of debt this doubling in debt problems involves a specific increase in people struggling with priority debts like utilities and council tax and a doubling of enquiries regarding mortgage arrears
4074881 there is no common type of debt we get the full range there are a lot of clients who come in unable to pay gas and electric bills but we are getting more and more issues relating to mortgage arrears credit cards and loans
4074882 people are often nervous and dont know what to do because they arent sure about what their rights are we still deal with many of the smaller debt problems here in withington but tend to refer larger ones to the specialists
4074883 i knew i was in good shape coming into the championship and i expected to win but not with such a fast time
4074884 the classes involve a range of things from gentle massage to singing to the babies the mums make their babies movements to encourage the way they would naturally move
4074885 most love it when youre doing the movements its interesting for the baby and its very relaxing so it tires them out its also great for post natal recovery in general with a range of non strenuous pelvic floor exercises for the mums and helps with their back and neck problems which come from breast feeding and carrying their children
4074886 the baby lies down and the mums make noises on their babies bellies kind of like blowing a raspberry different sounds correspond with the tummy chest and head babies particularly enjoy the umm belly sound because of the vibrations
4074887 i got into baby yoga because i taught classes for pregnant women we use the sounds in those classes too the idea is that the baby is used to the comforting noises by the time its born
4074888 you can do as much as you want and the same goes for what your baby wants you soon find out which bits work for you both babies can come until they are about eight months old once they start crawling it is impossible to keep them still
4074889 levenshulme has needed this kind of investment for years and we are now on the brink of something very special
4074890 the building needed so much work that we were never going to achieve this through traditional fundraising
4074891 while the odd bring and buy sale has helped we have set out a radical vision formed a strong partnership and tried to be pretty enterprising in our approach to raising the necessary investment we even sold the church organ on e bay
4074892 we are not there yet though and im still very keen to discuss our plans with other potential investors
4074893 this is a really exciting project and we cant wait to get started with the development we have a strong track record when it comes to creating amazing inspirational places for people to live in work at and visit and this community centre will be the very best of its kind around
4074894 its a really special development as it will be of benefit to so many people worshippers at the church community groups in their new facilities and residents of unique apartments for affordable rent
4074895 regeneration in manchester depends upon this kind of local partnership and we are pleased to be involved in such a creative scheme
4074896 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
4074897 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4074898 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4074899 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
4074900 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
4074901 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
4074902 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes
4074903 it isnt exact thats one we talked about it has to be exact
4074904 to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth
4074905 our results suggest that when intimacy ebbs doubts about the relationship emerge
4074906 making emerging adults aware of how romantic associations inevitably pose a threat to a persons subjective well being might help them to form more realistic romantic relationship goals
4074907 these low cost amplifying devices can look tempting to individuals with hearing impairment because of the significant cost differences
4074908 but our research found that the low cost aids generally dont meet the fitting requirements to help a hearing impaired person and could potentially damage a persons hearing
4074909 aside from being of extremely poor quality very low cost hearing aids those under 100 have the potential to damage your hearing because they send very loud sounds into the ear the studys mid range hearing aids 100 500 were of higher quality and were not considered a safety hazard
4074910 based on the research the best advice for consumers is to talk to an audiologist because hearing aids have complex technical features they need to be fitted and customized to the individual
4074911 currently more than 32 million people have a hearing impairment yet only about 25 percent of those use hearing aids
4074912 meanwhile the aging population is growing and hearing loss becomes more common as we become older
4074913 i have no view on whether it should be remade but it doesnt have my blessing
4074914 im not co producing it and i wont be involved in any way
4074915 the first i heard about it was when people sent me cuttings from us papers
4074916 ive even heard that theyre going to put new songs in i wrote the book the music and the lyrics
4074917 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
4074918 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
4074919 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
4074920 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
4074921 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol
4074922 it felt like an earthquake at first because the house shook so much when the tree came down
4074923 we couldnt believe what had happened when we saw the top of the tree in our front garden usually there is so much traffic on this road but luckily there were no cars about when the tree fell
4074924 one of our neighbours friends was driving past and decided to pop in to say hello at the last minute if hed continued driving his car would have been right under the tree when it fell it was very very lucky that no one was hurt
4074925 the tree was massive and it had brought down quite a lot of the wall with it loads of people were coming out of their houses to take a look at what had happened including john thomson who was milling around where the tree had fallen
4074926 im quite a dylan fan but lets face it who isnt we decided that the dylan festival would be the perfect end to our summer programme
4074927 a bootleg recording of the free trade hall concert was released in 1998 and we thought it would be an ideal opportunity to mark its tenth anniversary
4074928 we have acts coming from all over the uk and as far away as ireland to perform at the event some of the musicians will be playing judas style and others will be sticking to the traditional acoustic stuff more than a hundred people applied to be part of the festival the line up is a mix of all ages bands and solo acts it just goes to show how much appeal dylan still has
4074929 i am really excited about coming over to manchester and playing all my favourite dylan tracks as well as my own stuff it looks like a great line up for the weekend
4074930 this is a huge amount of council tax payers money mostly spent on short journeys mostly on non urgent matters
4074931 the people i represent will wonder why they have to pay to cross the m60 in rush hour to subsidise council staff who wont have to
4074932 im very disappointed especially after all the support from customers signing the petition and saying they wanted us to stay open
4074933 i feel sorry for a lot of the old people who are going to have to make other arrangements and for the local businesses too who like coming here
4074934 i just wish we were run as a service and not a business
4074935 i dont really know what im going to do now its a bad situation for the customers and for me personally
4074936 they are very unhappy about were going to close for ever at the end of september and everybody is moaning about it for me too im going to have to find a new job
4074937 its going to be harder for elderly people and people with pushchairs as they are going to have to go further to get to another post office
4074938 it appears that there was never any intention to reverse these closures and that is absolutely appalling
4074939 i feel like im in the middle of my career and i dont know where its going this feels like the first gig again
4074940 ive not been writing many songs i feel like ive lost the plot a bit
4074941 i didnt leave the republican party the party left me
4074942 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4074943 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4074944 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4074945 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4074946 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4074947 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kind of hokey but its the truth
4074948 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power

4074958 it directors are reasonably confident about the outlook over the next 12 months despite lingering economic uncertainty it departments savaged headcounts after the dot com and y2k booms but we appear to be a long way from a repeat of that scenario
4074959 the recent market peak was relatively modest since the market collapsed in 2001 02 it directors have been much more restrained in their hiring so it departments do not have a skills surplus
4074960 what you would normally expect to see in a downturn is it departments shedding staff and utilising greater numbers of contractors the focus on increasing permanent headcounts is a good barometer of robust demand over the longer term
4074961 spending on it during a slowdown can deliver significant efficiency gains and boost competitive advantage which can lead to greater cost savings over the longer term organisations increasingly recognise this so do not always shelve it projects in order to make short term cost savings when times get tough
4074962 rates for contractors tend to be much more volatile than salaries for staff and are prone to falling during a slowdown during the last downturn we had reports of rates for contractors being slashed by major banks but more than four times as many it directors think rates will rise than fall which shows that skills shortages are still very much an issue
4074963 there appears to be no end of the candidate market in sight with skills acquisition and retention still a pressing concern for it directors we are still seeing acute shortages of candidates with net proficiency for example and project management experience remains highly sought after

4074972 i think we are missing something its a great treasure in our backyard this is where our history was made

4074977 at the beginning of this year my wife told me she wired money overseas left from previous campaigns
4074978 if you look at the numbers thats like hitting 400
4074979 we run and put pressure on the defense in a manner that forces that our style of play lends itself for us to continue in that vein
4074980 when youre no 1 in that nation you want to be no 1 again year in and year out
4074981 thats how you build a reputation as one of the best secondaries in the country and thats what were trying to do
4074982 and if he is what does that do to the cornerback position because i can tell you deangelo smith is one of our 11 best players so if you go through the numbers if brandon underwood has to be on the field something has to give
4074983 they demand that we catch the ball every day in practice
4074984 every time we drop a ball weve got to do 10 push ups so we work on our hands every day we did it last year and we have pretty much the same defense just about so i dont see why we cant do it again
4074985 to give receivers and quarterbacks difficult reads sometimes we get a break that way
4074986 game situations and your opponent dictate sometimes how many youre going to get but we also know that we dropped 17 last year so if we just eliminate the drops well break the all time ncaa record
4074987 if you look at the numbers thats like hitting 400
4074988 we run and put pressure on the defense in a manner that forces that our style of play lends itself for us to continue in that vein

4074995 ive checked the programs of both madrid and oranje and i immediately saw it would be too much for me physically the combination of competition in spain the national cup the champions league i will have to make a choice i cant combine it with the national team anymore thats what i feel
4074996 i hifhly enjoyed this last ec honestly i look back at it with satisfaction despite our loss
4074997 obviously im sorry he made this decision and that i cant use him and his skills in the qualifications with his experience and mentality let alone his abilities he will be sorely missed i wish him all the best in madrid
4074998 there may be a time this year when we have to play without or our other top guys we took a lot of the number one guys out in the goal line scrimmage because we need to be able to count on everyone to step up if we need them its next man in and a great opportunity for us to teach our guys a little bit more about overcoming adversity
4074999 we are very excited that john has decided to be a bearcat

4075005 i have two formal questions one over and above the national costs how much is support of the proposed xxxth olympiad costing the residents council tax payers of waltham forest please express your answer as either per resident or as a total sum together with the current population within lbwf or in both forms two what permanent material lasting benefit will accrue to the residents of waltham forest as a result of that xxxth olympiad i also have supplementary questions one if there are any permanent benefits accruing and i have yet to see any evidence of such do the councillors and or the council itself consider that this is a good return upon the investment waste of money spent strike out whichever alternative is inappropriate two if in fact there are no permanent benefits accruing then why is our money being wasted and such vast disruption being forced on us against our wishes remember that if there are no benefits or very small ones the question of financial maladministration arises i look forward to your considered replies
4075006 probablemente esto ltimo se debe a que la resoluci n de la foto es m s baja

4075021 no es algo que pueda sorprender excesivamente y que se esconde detr s del argumento tan manido del d ficit h drico del levante espa ol

4075023 lamentablemente somos testigos de c mo el tema del agua genera grandes pol micas y abundantes dosis de demagogia tanto por el pp como el psoe y los respectivos gobiernos auton micos implicados como es el caso del de castilla la mancha cuando realmente la pol tica h drica e hidr ulica en nuestro pa s ha cambiado muy poco a pesar de los cambios de color en el gobierno central

4075053 the writer dic edwards and the composer keith burstein presented a complex view of the motivations ambitions and doubts of those attracted to suicide bombing
4075054 unsurprisingly burstein took the reviewer to mean that he was glorifying terrorists and thus once the terrorism act 2006 came into force at risk of prosecution should the opera be revived
4075055 we referred to a composer as being accused of promoting terrorism we should have made clear that this was the meaning the composer keith burstein ascribed to a review of his opera the court of appeal did not accept that the review conveyed this meaning and ruled that this conclusion could be reached only by a strained interpretation

4075057 the new conference centre will have a comfortable yet modern feel complete with all the latest technology raising the bar for meeting space and culinary excellence within our industry
4075058 the versatility of our space was very important to us we wanted to keep it simple and elegant so that our events can create their own look and feel
4075059 but just as important was the quality of our culinary services we can create state of the art restaurant style cuisine that can be prepared for 25 or 2 500 guests with each plate having as much colour texture and flavour as you would experience in a high end dining room

4075069 every time we have talked about homeland security monies and where they should go i have pointed out repeatedly you catch a terrorist anyplace in the world with a map its a map of new york city not a map of some cornfield in the midwest
4075070 we view all threats as credible threats and i dont know that we have enough information to determine in this case theres a lot of evidence that it is credible and ill leave that to the professionals but we take every single case and assume it is credible until proven otherwise
4075071 it is not right that we charge our police with combating crime and disorder and then tie their hands behind their backs in the name of whitehall bureaucracy

4075193 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4075194 nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4075195 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
4075196 as asian pacific americans support u s olympic athletes some of whom are asian american it is disturbing to oca that spains basketball team would introduce such divisive imagery into the olympics

4075203 we knew the game would be very hard we were prepared
4075204 a battle will be some sort of 50 50 situations we like to keep possession and find a rhythm and i think that will be our chance to win the game the first 10 minutes will be tough and whoever dictates the tempo has the chance to win the game
4075205 against canada we always expect a very physical game and we need to play our game and not get caught up in what their tendencies are
4075206 we play canada quite often this is the fifth time this year so you would think by now we know what to expect from them
4075207 for us to be in the olympics for the first time and to be in the quarterfinals three matches away from a medal is a great feeling
4075208 i really think that three four or five teams are still at the top at the moment and are the real contenders for the top titles but now to be at the top we teams have to work much better harder than before

4075215 i was in very good shape back then 2004 if i couldnt win a gold then then i thought i could never get a gold
4075216 my coach took me on vacation and told me that the 2008 games would be the greatest chance in 100 years and i should have a try at it he kept pushing me and then he kicked me to the highest position on the podium

4075225 missing the boat how political and advocacy communications leaders spend campaign funds
4075226 it seems that the traditional media people have history on their side with their ability to provide numbers about effectiveness of media buys from several campaign cycles in the past unlike web publishers
4075227 the consultants for the most part are also more familiar with the traditional media sellers and know how they are going to make their fees the online world requires more time to figure out the media buy and newer ways of communicating the candidates message all hard work if you have never done it before

4075244 its slightly ahead of last year but the proportion of applications is up as well my guess is that there will still be 30 000 students placed through the clearing process

4075258 our port visit to umm qasr demonstrates the great confidence we have in our iraqi partners and reflects the marked improvements in security that they have achieved within the past several months
4075259 this visit gave us a chance to interact with senior iraqi navy leadership and further enhance coalition cooperation with the iraqi navy and marines
4075260 making a port visit to iraq and interacting with iraqi officers is very important because it builds relationships and promotes positive interaction between our navies
4075261 today was a once in a lifetime opportunity and i am proud to help make a positive difference in iraqs future
4075262 there has been significant progress in iraq during the past year and a half that allowed firebolt to make this port visit to umm qasr
4075263 visits like this are important because they help reinforce the strong ties that already exist between our two navies this visit clearly demonstrates the coalition partnership in maritime security with the iraqi navy and our commitment to the government of iraq and its people
4075264 our forces are here to foster security and cooperation in the region and to conduct operations that contribute to peace and stability
4075265 u s and coalition forces provide the assurance of security and stability that enables the economic development and growing prosperity of the people throughout this region the people of iraq are beginning to enjoy these benefits and our cooperation with the iraqi navy will ensure that they prosper as they expand their participation in the global economy

4075268 what i am requesting is for your member airlines to begin allowing all military personnel traveling on orders to check a third bag without being charged
4075269 this should not be a difficult decision to reach but it is one that needs to be made
4075270 long and proud history of supporting our nations military men and women
4075271 they routinely offer special fares for military personnel and families attempt when possible to accommodate unplanned schedule changes and generally seek to do what they can to show their appreciation
4075272 we can also refocus family support and education programs to discuss alcohol misuse and to educate all on resources available in the military in the department of veterans affairs and in the civilian community
4075273 the national guard is constantly seeking better ways to maintain and improve the behavioral health and general well being of its warriors through synergistic programs including chaplain support family support employment assistance advocacy counseling and training and this new position is another way of meeting those needs
4075274 we recognize the unique needs of our citizen soldiers and airmen and are constantly looking for innovative ways that we can better meet those needs
4075275 our sole goal is to safely and rapidly deliver humanitarian aid to georgia to alleviate human suffering and save lives
4075276 we will continue to support this humanitarian mission until the host nation and the u s state department determine that it is no longer needed
4075277 thank you so much for helping us in this great time of need these supplies will surely save lives
4075278 we are very pleased that the joint military community eucom u s army europe and u s air forces in europe have the opportunity to provide logistical support to bring these humanitarian supplies here

4075288 take advantage of house price falls with the arc bricks amp mortar plan
4075289 we dont have much leverage because russia now has recovered from its economic collapse
4075290 it seems to have stabilized its position in chechnya and its not exposed elsewhere in the world it has a trade surplus it has oil and gas and it is very hard i think to find leverage to use against them at this point
4075291 the russians have a naval force the black sea force that is based in sevastopol and that theyve used as part of the blockade of the abkhazian coastline or the georgian coastline
4075292 but of course it means that were in the same body of water and i assume theres no implied threat that we would try to interdict naval movements on the part of the russian black sea fleet
4075293 hopefully this is being in some way coordinated with the russians
4075294 it does show that we are on the brink of something serious small conflict people didnt care about south ossetia and yet those small conflicts can bring two superpowers into conflict and create tremendous instability in the world
4075295 you have to have the approval of all the other countries and i think theyve been neutralized effectively in part because almost every one of them at least in europe have become dependent on russian oil and gas
4075296 and there is no doubt in my mind that prime minister vladmir putin is aware of this and president dmitri medvedev certainly is aware of this because he was the head of gazprom which was the source of supply of so much of that natural gas
4075297 if all the key players beginning with moscow and then europe and then the united states washington do not keep their heads if they react intemperately on any part and dont have a longer term vision react only to immediate events and do so with inflammatory language and maybe even with impetuous steps retaliatory steps things could get much worse
4075298 last month i acted and i lifted an executive branch restriction on offshore oil exploration
4075299 and then i called on congress to join me and to lift the legislative ban to end the legislative ban unfortunately the democratic leadership in congress decided to go on a five week vacation a recess rather than act on behalf of the american consumer the american small business owner
4075300 gas prices four dollars five dollars no end in sight because some in washington are still saying no to drilling in america no to independence from foreign oil who can you thank for rising prices at the pump crowds cheering obama one man knows we must now drill more in america and rescue our family budgets dont hope for more energy vote for it mccain im john mccain and i approve this message
4075301 on gas prices john mccain is part of the problem mccain and bush support a drilling plan that wont produce a drop of oil for seven years mccain will give more tax breaks to big oil he has voted with bush 95 percent of the time barack obama will make energy independence an urgent priority raise mileage standards fast track technology for alternative fuels 1 000 tax cut to help families as we break the grip of foreign oil a real plan and new energy im barack obama and i approve this message
4075302 no your not i am no your not quit copying me
4075303 there is no cause for alarm because we are dealing with the same strain of virus
4075304 the ones that are prevalent in africa have been class 1 and 2 but the one we are having is class 3 and it is very common in western countries but it is the same strain of h5n1 we are dealing with the point here is that we should expend our surveillance system we should continue to expand our search for the source of the organism

4075437 he left me for dead he was trying to kill me

4075444 i agree with your premise that sutcliffe was not responsible for all the murders
4075445 it was known in the top echelons of the police that two men were involved in the series of murders
4075446 i dont think now that sutcliffe did all the killings he
4075447 this man will continue to kill until hes caught no woman is safe
4075448 police also released details of two phone calls that came into the incident room in both bradford and northumbria within a week of the murder of barbara leach in bradford they claimed that a man phoned in to both stations in a frenzy and claimed that the letters were a hoax the calls were recorded by police manning the phones now chris gregg says that this was john humble who was repentant and attempted to warn police that the letters were a hoax however in the independant newspaper the reporter had taken the trouble to delve further into it and found that the police forensic laboratory had eliminated this voice as being the im jack author shortly after it was made this means that that person could not have been john humble and the police laboratory eliminated him then this information in fact undermines the case against john humble based on police evidence that chris gregg appears to have overlooked in fabricating the confession and conviction of humble

4075458 it may have been found or handed to someone but it could link back to becky and it is important that we trace her missing watch
4075459 the dollar continues to gain ground across the board as the global economic outlook begins to converge with that of the us
4075460 certainly yesterdays comments by the bank of england did little to help improve support for the pound with the prospect of zero growth in 2009 adding to downside pressures
4075461 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4075462 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4075463 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4075464 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4075465 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4075466 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4075487 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4075488 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4075489 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4075490 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4075491 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4075492 i really feel like i am a part of the all blacks set up now that i have been getting a few starts under my belt
4075493 with kevy mealamu around i have always had to battle to get starts in the all black jersey especially at the start of my test career
4075494 moving on now though i am a little bit older and enjoying my rugby a lot more and it makes it a lot easier that i get on with kevy so well
4075495 kev and i are pretty good mates so there is never any hard feelings between us when the side is announced
4075496 we have both benched for each other and been there before so it is old hat now and we are both mature enough to accept the decision and just get on with things
4075497 yeah i have snuck over for a few this season which is always nice
4075498 it was nice to get one from further out than a metre although i think sivi sivivatu was a little shocked to see me lurking out there but i did him proud
4075499 at the moment i am just enjoying playing and the group of guys we have are bloody good its always nice to get the tries but at the moment they are just a bonus on top of getting a regular place in the run on side
4075500 i dont really worry too much about what you guys write in the papers
4075501 i have enough to focus on in getting my job done i am out there to throw well and hook well so if i can do my basic job well i am pretty happy
4075502 so it is best not to focus on all the pre match hype and just get on with the job at hand
4075503 obviously they are world champions and that plus they are at home so its a big challenge for us to come and play them over here
4075504 we just need to ensure we turn up and hit the levels we know we are capable of if we can do that it should be a good game on saturday and one which we know we can win
4075505 gary roberts is a physical hard nosed player who is obviously a good size and hes massive on the ice
4075506 i think hes got such a reputation as a feared player that hes definitely one of the guys that you want on your side
4075507 if you dont want any soup dont come in the kitchen
4075508 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4075509 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4075522 they have classes all over the island but i think its good when you can be at home in your home clothes
4075523 if they didnt have online classes i wouldnt have started school in my situation
4075524 people are mentioning that more students are working during the summer so the online format gives them the flexibility of taking a class during the summer
4075525 in other words if theyre out of a job theyll take education out if they have to pay high gas prices they would opt for something that would be less of a financial burden on them and their families
4075526 you have mothers you have people who are coming back to school so its a good perspective especially as far as education goes
4075527 typically the level of interaction in online courses is higher because you cant sit in the back of the classroom and not raise your hand
4075528 if you dont take part in the conversation thats happening online its like you dont exist
4075529 it gets you really interested and it really focuses you

4075715 we are particularly pleased that we are experiencing sales growth across most of our brands despite taking significant price increases to offset record raw material costs our strategy of owning number one brands and supporting them with consistent investments in marketing and product innovation provides opportunities for continued long term profitable growth
4075716 we look forward to adding another number one brand with the merger of the folgers coffee business into smucker
4075717 folgers r will be our largest brand with sales in excess of 1 5 billion and builds on our center of the store focus we expect the addition of folgers to significantly increase cash flow and combined with the substantial increase in our size and scale provide a platform for future growth and enhance our long term growth opportunities

4075722 we are very pleased with our revenue growth in the quarter with overall revenues up 66 and revenues in the corrections group up 94
4075723 however we also had some challenges in the quarter resulting in an ebitda margin that was below our expectations we started to strengthen the infrastructure of our security electronics business in the first quarter but it took more time than we had expected to develop the people systems and structure necessary to support our significant growth but as a result of the actions that have been taken we believe that we will be in a position to achieve the margin run rates that we had targeted for the last half of 2008
4075724 we believe that with the operational issues now rectified we have the proper infrastructure in place to support our current and future growth we have committed additional management resources to ensure that we are running at optimal efficiency most notably we have appointed mike peterson as coo of argyle corrections group and we are also providing more comprehensive training to all of our supervisory personnel with tighter management controls and better training we believe we can drive more profitable revenue growth we also expect to realize significant costsavings by integrating lower cost technologies across argyle usa which was largely completed in august of this year we believe this will be reflected in our margins starting in the fourth quarter of this year
4075725 in the face of challenging economic times our primary focus for driving new business in argyle commercial security group is on those industries where security is not an option but a necessity petrochemical infrastructure such as ports utility companies and waste and water treatment plants and healthcare our plan remains to expand our national footprint in the commercial market through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions as the market is highly fragmented and ripe for consolidation there is an abundance of acquisition candidates which may become available to argyle we continue to evaluate opportunities that make good strategic sense for argyle and could be acquired for the right price

4075799 we are pleased to report on a solid second quarter of 2008 for the trust economic strength in western canada continued to support strong demand for rental accommodations in our largest markets this quarter producing positive revenue growth for the trust funds from operations ffo and ffo per unit increased approximately 10 6 and 13 2 respectively over last years second quarter much of our success this quarter can be attributed to our three pronged revenue maximization strategy in which we actively monitor occupancy adjust price and apply suite specific incentives in the first quarter of 2008 we strategically reduced market rents on select properties in response to weaker seasonal demand and quickly realized an increase in occupancy in the second quarter this strategy continued to be very successful with occupancy improving overall in alberta saskatchewan british columbia and quebec this improved occupancy places the trust in a strong position for continued revenue growth over the third and fourth quarters of 2008 despite some adjustments market rents remain quite stable with slight increases or decreases depending on the local rental market
4075800 saskatchewans booming economy continues to produce outstanding market fundamentals particularly in saskatoon saskatchewans largest centre house prices in saskatoon and regina continue to increase at a significant pace creating a strong value differential for the rental option monthly occupied rent in our property portfolio increased approximately 44 in saskatchewan in june 2008 over march 2008 and increased approximately 137 year over year average market rents in saskatchewan increased 63 in june 2008 compared to march 2008 and increased 257 year over year though some market fundamentals have tempered from their peak alberta continues to exhibit solid economic strength strong employment growth a thriving energy sector and healthy international migration continue to bode well for rental demand with 54 of our portfolio located in the province we are pleased to note continued growth at a more sustainable pace over the second quarter of 2008 a large housing inventory and a continued tempering of housing prices were noted in calgary and edmonton despite increased housing options for consumers we are pleased to report improved occupancy in both calgary and edmonton on a quarter over quarter basis we believe that our incremental approach to market rents with a focus on occupancy continues to be the best way to maximize revenues in these markets average occupied rents were up approximately 6 in calgary and up approximately 10 in edmonton in june 2008 compared to march 2008 market rents increased approximately 51 in calgary and decreased approximately 5 in edmonton in june 2008 compared to march 2008 year over year market rent decreased by 34 and 75 in calgary and edmonton respectively
4075801 for the second quarter 2008 same store revenue increased by 9 6 compared to the same period in the prior year despite rental expenses increasing by 12 0 net operating income growth improved overall by 8 2 the increase in reported stabilized revenue was driven mainly by the trusts alberta operations which account for approximately 61 0 of the trusts reported stabilized net operating income the majority of the reported increase in rental operating expenses for the three months ended june 30 2008 was due to higher utility costs particularly the cost of natural gas for the six months ended june 30 2008 same store revenues increased by 9 6 over the same period last year resulting in an overall increase in net operating income of 8 8 despite an increase of 11 0 in operating expenses in the first six months of 2008 overall the increased operating expenses were the result of an increase in the number of units in the portfolio and higher utility costs
4075802 on a sequential basis stabilized revenues grew 2 5 from q1 2008 to q2 2008 2 9 from q4 2007 to q1 2008 1 5 from q3 2007 to q4 2007 and 2 4 from q2 2007 to q3 2007
4075803 in the second quarter of 2008 the trust closed on a previously announced acquisition of 297 rental units in calgary alberta the acquisition had a total purchase price of 48 8 million and a year one cap rate of 5 86

4075896 most americans pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes payroll taxes take a much bigger portion of the paychecks of lower income americans than of higher income viewed as a whole the current tax system is quite regressive
4075897 what is the effect when both payroll taxes and their benefits are considered
4075898 why in part i suspect because they know the answer doesnt fit their politics and in part because the analysis is challenging with many nuances and moving parts
4075899 the rapid growth in payroll taxes over the past 40 years has imposed a large burden on working americans this burden has fallen disproportionately on low income workers however in the context of a comprehensive tax policy it is misleading to focus on the short term burden imposed by payroll taxes without accounting for the future benefits they provide through the social security program social security benefits are paid according to a progressive formula that gives low wage workers a better rate of return on their contributions than it gives high wage workers the progressivity of the benefit formula outweighs the disproportionate burden imposed by the tax as a result low wage workers can expect to receive benefits that exceed the sum of their and their employers payroll tax contributions middle and high wage workers on the other hand can expect to pay substantially more into the system than they will receive in benefits overall middle and high wage workers subsidize the income and payroll tax liabilities of low wage workers leaving most low wage workers with net negative tax liabilities throughout their lifetimes

4075916 in hoofdstuk drie van on liberty 1859 heeft de liberale denker john stuart mill al overtuigend laten zien dat wij allemaal gebaat zijn bij het behoud van verscheidenheid een individu kan zich pas echt ontwikkelen tot een volwaardige persoon als hij zichzelf kan confronteren met andere individuen andere levensstijlen andere manieren van tegen de werkelijkheid aankijken de stad is de plaats waar die confrontatie plaatsvindt waar iedereen zijn eigen gang gaat en zich meet aan anderen en waar de samenleving op een informele manier met zichzelf experimenteert beleidsmakers zingen weliswaar de lof van de verscheidenheid want men houdt wel van wat kleur op straat maar dan alleen zolang het binnen de perken van de onschuldige idylle blijft men wil de lusten zonder het risico

4075944 el fondo no ha sido bueno en sus l neas de prefinanciaci n de exportaciones
4075945 es una deuda pendiente y tenemos que ver lo que ha pasado ya que no se est prestando plata para financiaci n del comercio exterior

4075955 desde que comenz la gesti n del secretario de agricultura de la naci n juan carlos cheppi empezamos a trabajar en temas comunes que hacen a la producci n de olivos bovinos caprinos cun colas y programas relacionados a la infraestructura de sistemas de riego para todo el pa s
4075956 teniendo en cuenta que depender n de esta rea nacional las actividades que realicen la secretar as de agricultura y de ganader a hoy tomamos contacto adem s con la gente del p s a para avanzar en la concreci n de acciones comunes y atender los planteamiento de cada sector
4075957 la idea central expresada por los miembros del p s a fue trabajar de la manera m s eficiente posible en la utilizaci n de los fondos disponibles para el desarrollo rural a trav s de la coordinaci n de un nico programa nacional en donde tengan vertiente de aporte todos los programas en esta materia
4075958 encaramos con gran expectativa la creaci n de esta nueva estructura dentro de la secretar a de agricultura de la naci n
4075959 tenemos un componente de peque os productores que representan m s del 80 de los de nuestra provincia los recursos de los que disponemos son escasos lo que nos obliga a coordinar tareas tanto con la naci n como tambi n con toda la estructura provincial que tiene que ver con el desarrollo
4075960 estamos dando los primeros pasos priorizaremos utilizar los escasos recursos de la manera m s racional
4075961 la gente tiene una gran expectativa ya que tanto en lo filos fico como en el mensaje de nuestra presidenta y del gobernador beder herrera respecto a dar un perfil productivo a la rioja conf an en que nosotros que somos los estamentos intermedios hagamos alianzas acuerdos y podamos llevar adelante acciones concretas en base a los lineamientos dispuestos para el sector productivo
4075962 dialogamos para que tengamos claro el lineamiento pol tico y las acciones concretas a llevar a cabo
4075963 si bien el p s a pertenece a la naci n en la rioja somos pocos y nos conocemos mucho por eso debemos hacer planes de trabajo y contribuir desde cada una de las instituciones para planificar con mayor acierto todo lo que tiene que ver con el desarrollo
4075964 no es un reclamo s lo queremos ponernos de acuerdo en las cosas que no lo pudimos hacer antes es decir que entre el p s a las secretar as de agricultura y de ganader a podamos trabajar en una clientela com n los peque os productores
4075965 el lineamiento es uno solo creo que por suerte ahora estamos alineados tanto pol tica como ideol gicamente y t cnicamente en una sola filosof a de trabajo que es el desarrollo territorial y el de la gente sobre todo
4075966 lo fundamental es que vamos a aunar todos los recursos disponibles
4075967 la semana pasada tuvimos una reuni n con todo el equipo del secretario cheppi en donde presentamos el programa de desarrollo territorial que tiene como base fundamental a nuestro productores que tienen necesidades b sicas insatisfechas y necesitan motorizar su producci n a trav s de una inyecci n fuerte de capital infraestructura y capacitaci n
4075968 el programa viene trabajando en todo el pa s desde hace quince a os y por tal motivo vemos con gran entusiasmo la creaci n de la subsecretar a de desarrollo rural y agricultura familiar ya que viene a fortalecer una decisi n pol tica de poner nfasis en el sector de los peque os productores
4075969 es una gran oportunidad para fortalecer al sector ya que contaremos con el apoyo de todas las reas involucradas en la producci n por lo que podemos pensar en proyectos a largo plazo

4076097 it is a matter of great shame for the nation which calls itself secular that a land of about 800 acres can not be given for construction of temporary sheds for the amarnath pilgrims at baltal in kashmir province of jammu and kashmir state the political leaders of valley have been exploiting the issue just to fulfill their political motives and have been playing with the beliefs of millions of hindus living in and outside india we would like to bring a fact to your notice that the forest minister in the cabinet was from the pdp a coalition partner in the government yet they the pdp refused to accept responsibility for the joint decision of allocating forest land to set up temporary structures for facilities for hindu pilgrims during the amarnath yatra the pdp which is led by mufti mohammad sayeed played electoral politics of the lowest kind by hitching its voice to the hurriyat objections and pulled out of the government and above that mr ghulam nabi azad who held the post of chief minister revoked the land order back while his government was in minority moreover when islamia univ was to be constructed at rajouri and kashmir the state govt gave them forest land and that too free of cost but the amarnath trust was told to pay 2 5 crores of rupees for constructing temporary sheds during the months of yatra respected madam we would like to put another fact in front of you that the city of jammu has been burning since last one month the jkp jammu amp kashmir police has been continuously beating up peaceful protesters and killed two of them by opening firing on a procession i request you to take necessary steps so that peace be restored in this state and land be given back to the amarnath trust

4076140 one of the fundamental questions that neuroscientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons to the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms and whole animals
4076141 this project gives us a really useful and unique opportunity to look at something that may exhibit whole behaviours but still remains closely tied to the activity of individual neurons
4076142 at school it was the worst that was the worst pain i had
4076143 i was bullied quite a lot by other pupils even by a teacher i was bullied quite severely
4076144 i wouldnt eat at school in the end i went in to school for my exams and came home
4076145 i couldnt cope with the pressure of being in that environment i was constantly under stress
4076146 when people called me fat it would make me eat more it didnt spur me on to lose weight
4076147 i was at a family party and a family friend had lost 2st 7lbs dieting and that spurred me on
4076148 also i was in a clothes store and that was the only store i would go in because i knew they stocked larger sizes
4076149 their larger size was too tight and i thought im either going to have to have clothes specially made or im going to get stuck in the house constantly and i wont be able to go out and enjoy things with friends
4076150 the hardest part for me wasnt actually giving up the food it was admitting i had a problem and going along to the group
4076151 when youre young and when youre a man going to a slimming group it can be quite a daunting thing
4076152 you think about tv shows you see and its all a joke or its full of older women talking about diets and things you can and cant have
4076153 you gradually start off following the plan you fit five minutes of exercise in whenever you like through the day
4076154 you build that up over time and now i walk five miles a night with my mum
4076155 my confidence and self esteem has gone way up before it was nonexistent
4076156 now ill go out i feel like nothing holds me back i go on nice holidays i travel by myself

4076159 the idea of a model health certificate is not a bad idea in itself but its just impossible to police and to govern
4076160 thats why it hasnt been implemented at this stage because theres just no way of doing it
4076161 whos to say that a girl who gets this certificate lets say its valid for a year isnt going to be ok in six months time or a years time you just dont know
4076162 the british fashion council have stepped away from one of the fundamental recommendations of the model health inquiry
4076163 fashion is fantastic it can be wonderful but there are some aspects of it that are still actually quite toxic

4076186 dollar asia went up a day or two days ahead of dollar peso
4076187 asian fx will resume its appreciation trend in the first quarter of 2009
4076188 jpmorgans view is that the global downturn will be shallow and that the gradual growth recovery in 2009 should lend support to asian currencies
4076189 we expect that a weaker singapore dollar is in line with a broad based us dollar rally and in particular for the euro to lose more ground against the us dollar
4076190 there is a good chance that the economy is already in recession but even if it isnt the outlook remains for subdued growth in the quarters to come
4076191 a technical recession in the euro zone is possible because there is a chance that we will have a slight contraction in the third quarter as well according to leading indicators in the last months
4076192 todays reports all paint a similar picture sharp corrections in fixed investment and exports those having been the main engine of growth over the past few years and stagnating private consumption
4076193 the question is when will they cut interest rates but with inflation so high the ecb cannot cut in the coming months we expect a cut only in the third quarter of 2009
4076194 the doctor was not authorised to utter even a single word about the issue it is the governments responsibility to inform the media about this issue

4076198 however i have yet to see results that would indicate that we should invest heavily in this area i personally feel that it has yet to deliver results in online activities like search and reading information based sites users are actively looking for information or consuming information relevant to their interests placing ads on these sites relevant to the content or search will always deliver strong results
4076199 however with social networking sites response rates to ads are much lower as it can be more difficult to target relevant ads
4076200 affiliate marketers are often much better at seo than merchants affiliate marketing specialists say most travel companies are in business to fill seats but actually providing these services or even providing booking technology is not the same thing as creating relevant content and playing the never ending google game

4076254 were such a small school that a few kids can really swing the results
4076255 we consider that pretty stable considering we tested 89 more kids
4076256 that just means that there are more kids considering college after high school

4076265 millions of people contribute content like planets buildings and creatures to your game but its not real time
4076266 youre seeing copies of peoples stuff so you can go up and blow up a planet and you havent ruined their experience

4076268 i was driving along parrs wood road and a police car was blocking the way on a closer look i saw they were blocking an escaped cow the police car had blocked it into someones path
4076269 i couldnt believe my eyes its not something you normally see on the way to the shops imagine opening your front door to find a huge black cow on your path
4076270 a neighbour told me the cow had got out then we got the call from the police saying they had her cornered in someones driveway she was very relaxed when we got there and happily got in the trailer
4076271 i think she just fancied getting out and about for a bit you know what women are like once they get an idea in their heads theres no stopping them im sure she had a nice time out in didsbury but it wasnt my idea of fun
4076272 she doesnt have a name because we only give names to our pedigrees but im sure our escapees earned herself a bit of a celebrity status now

4076333 having it open to the public again will be incredible plus the state is getting 600 acres of river floodplain
4076334 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4076335 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
4076336 for another two days russian troops will stay in the region to carry out procedures of handing over control functions to georgian law enforcement bodies after which they will leave
4076337 all buildings are in normal shape the town is supplied with water and electricity
4076338 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbours that what it thinks about us policy
4076339 he was popular with everyone there are suspicions that it was weils disease following his death six of the workers went to hospital for tests
4076340 it was all the guys who had been exposed to the flood water last week and had flue like symptoms were all a bit worried
4076341 we confirm that a carillion employee has passed away the health and safety executive and police are investigating the incident and we are co operating but the cause of death has not yet been established
4076342 family are being informed and our sympathies go out to them and friends of our colleague
4076343 some of the managers paid a visit and decided to close down everyone has now left except for me
4076344 there are no suspicious circumstances although a post mortem will establish the cause of death
4076345 we are aware of the incident and police are investigating
4076346 this has been a terrifying ordeal for the man involved
4076347 we know there were a number of people in the area at the time and are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident
4076348 this was an unprovoked attack which left the victim with serious injuries and we are anxious to speak to anyone with any information
4076349 we know that there were two members of the public who came to the victims aid and we are keen to speak to them
4076350 anyone else who witnessed the incident or who recognises the description of the suspect is also urged to get in touch
4076351 people use the word a lot but i really do believe that jenners is an institution
4076352 it means a great deal to the people of edinburgh weve got a fantastic historical store but it is a bit outmoded and we really wanted to maintain that tradition but with a modern twist
4076353 our customer is still very much steeped in that history
4076354 we want to retain that tradition and heritage and it will always be jenners but now its jenners a house of fraser store
4076355 i know people dont like change but some things because they are outmoded we do have to change
4076356 jenners was the ultimate shopping destination in recent years it did lose its touch but so too have most retailers
4076357 out of all the stores in edinburgh i still think jenners is the best in terms of offering and customer service marks amp spencer is now thin on the ground with staff while other stores have a self service image
4076358 i do think jenners lost its way along the road but its not indicative of a problem with just jenners but more a change in trends from then to now
4076359 its exciting to hear that jenners are having a revamp maybe they will steal john lewis crown
4076360 i think maybe for a while jenners was in the fashion wilderness in terms of the high end of what young people wanted
4076361 i think its maybe had a bit of a shove since the opening of harvey nichols as well
4076362 i think they are doing well in terms of carrying brands that are unique to it and i think it still does attract the older customer that will always go there for tea and a wee look around and thats really important
4076363 we just dont feel that there is such a parking problem here
4076364 any problem that there may be has been imposed by the councils blind determination to impose this policy its making it harder for people to get into the city to work and to shop its basically just a tax its not really helping parking for anyone
4076365 theres an environmental issue too because its going to encourage people with gardens to dig them up and put a driveway in which will have a drastic effect on the history and the feel of the place
4076366 the situation has got worse over the last six months
4076367 i think its a good idea despite the inconvenience of not being able to park within half a mile of your own front door unless you are very lucky
4076368 the over crowding results in illegal and unsafe parking which is a danger to children and old people crossing roads
4076369 to assert that there is not a problem is simply misleading
4076370 there are no formal plans at the moment to extend the cpz and the council is just looking for feedback in order to decide whether to bring forward more parking zones
4076371 there is no desire at all to impose an unwanted scheme upon the residents
4076372 the council will collate the responses they have and put them to the transport infrastructure and environment committee in september and at that point they will decide
4076373 the initial plans were very optimistic and there were delays in earlier stages neither of which we can do much about now
4076374 nor can we alter the international economic situation and we have to take account of changes in the housing market what we can do and are doing is revising our business plan
4076375 despite falling house sales the new homes at craigmillar have exceeded all expectations since first hitting the market
4076376 the current economic climate poses serious challenges to wels development strategy for granton
4076377 unfortunately wels plans have been shaken by the credit crunch however by amending our plans and looking at new avenues to secure investment we have made 4 million from land sales
4076378 i advertisement m genuinely sorry to know of all the difficulties you have had in your past but you cannot tackle these or cure them by embarking on criminal behaviour
4076379 i take the view that a custodial sentence is appropriate
4076380 she was under significant financial burden at the time and was receiving no financial support from her husband
4076381 these frauds were committed to buy groceries for the family
4076382 when we saw it we were just overwhelmed at how beautiful it was there were tomato plants and a plaque on the wall with charlys garden written on it it is amazing what they have done for charly
4076383 the staff worked really hard pooling all their ideas and working in groups to raise money to develop the garden staff organised a mix of fundraising events
4076384 hbos is committed to working through these changes as carefully and methodically as possible
4076385 this is a further blow for jobs in the financial services sector which is being brought about by the credit crunch and the changing economic climate
4076386 it has been a long project and i had to stop going out to the congo during the civil war there in the mid 90s
4076387 i have had malaria on a number of occasions which is a big risk out there and was quite bad but it is all worth it
4076388 on this last trip alone we collected over 20 species that have never been recorded in the congo before
4076389 the biggest difficult is the sweat bee which is very much like a midge except it doesnt bite instead it swarms everywhere getting in your eyes and ears up your nose and it can quickly become unbearable insect repellent doesnt work and we did what the locals do roll up leaves and put them in your ears
4076390 we are studying the behaviour of the congos larger animals and for years we have seen the different plants they eat but have had no way of identifying them
4076391 its a good thing that its in an urban environment all the street trees in this city are numbered we know where they all are and at this point we havent found it out in forested land and thats a very good thing
4076392 the scourge of underage drinking if you were not aware of it before
4076393 it is clear on the night in question quite a number of young people 15 year olds were drinking and indulging in bad behaviour
4076394 he never let anything get in his way even at the point where the disease took hold and he was unable to walk talk or eat he never let it upset him
4076395 the massive range of work we support from providing medical equipment in romania to delivering a peace and empowerment programme in guatemala is all tailored to the real day to day needs of local people in the different areas of the world where it is delivered
4076396 by their own admission martin currie have disinvested from vedanta because of uncertainty over the future of the niyamgiri project
4076397 it is fundamental that we expect companies to behave both within the law and morally
4076398 the doubts over the issues with the bauxite project led to exiting the stock
4076399 with two gold medals already won in beijing perhaps peoples hopes for britains success on the 2012 medal table will change
4076400 hopefully beijing will inspire the younger generation to take up sport or try something they have not done before
4076401 the uk is well on track to deliver a truly spectacular games in 2012
4076402 our own researchshowed that 76 per cent of people questioned were pleased that the games were coming to the uk
4076403 we will continue to consult locally on issues such as skatepark design play facilities and on any concerns raised over the past few months with a view to submitting proposals to planning in the near future
4076404 i get a real buzz when people see them for the first time
4076405 intense scrutiny by the prospective clients judging panels or our peers
4076406 these same projects are also closely scrutinised by the city of edinburgh planning officials and councillors historic scotland and the scottish governments design advisor group architecture amp design scotland and in many cases through detailed public consultation
4076407 a number of our high profile projects also have the benefit of being collaborative efforts
4076408 the victim was taken by surprise and although not seriously injured he is understandably shaken
4076409 anyone who was in easter road in the early hours of monday morning and witnessed the attack or who saw the suspects either before or after the incident took place should contact police
4076410 the memorandum of understanding is an evolution and a formalisation of links that the two universities have had for almost ten years with staff from both universities having participated in joint projects
4076411 the computer contained personal information on several thousand of our patients amongst many other files of less sensitive data
4076412 the lists contained details including patients names their date of birth post code hospital number and the hospital procedure the patient was about to undertake
4076413 its a small community so they knew each other within the canoeing world when stuart was canoeing there was no lottery money to support athletes so he was actually still working
4076414 we were ecstatic it was absolutely fantastic davids a fantastic character he can just keep himself so focussed and thats just what you need to be
4076415 i ved jo alle hvad der siges om m nd med s
4076416 hvis du har tommeltotter s store som dine t e
4076417 hehe ja v rsgo hvad med at lave et sygos
4076418 were going to have to ask people to work until theyre 70 and well need a more reasonable health care system
4076419 as indie music zealots we love sites like pitchfork stereogum and brooklyn vegan
4076420 what was amazing to me is that you have a few hundred sites that cater to tastemakers within the music scene but no one is doing this for books and literature contrary to popular beliefs people are still reading books and we intend to share our favorite titles with them and highlight amazing books in the marketplace
4076421 im really chuffed with some of the times i put in as well
4076422 it reduces waste dramatically saves space and labour in the bar but above all makes a difference to the volume of glass going in to the land fill
4076423 these bars bought crushers to reduce the time and labour staff spend on removing garbage from the bars when the places are very busy and to cut down on the space slim jim units take up in a bar for empty bottles which can be used for display or other more business oriented uses
4076424 the bars are also seriously reducing the volume of garbage they send to the dump we really need to see more bar owners use the crushers so we can get a local paving company to be interested enough to take the crushed glass and use it as fill
4076425 it really goes against the grain for most of us to throw away glass
4076426 many of the people working in caymans bars and restaurants come from places where if it is not illegal to throw away glass it is a cultural taboo
4076427 we want to raise awareness about these kind of social issues such as the crusher raise money for various causes as well as introduce new drink products
4076428 we like to take the opportunity to tell the bartenders whats new what are the trends we demonstrate new cocktails and we keep everyone abreast of what we have
4076429 one of the fastest growing beer products in the us at the moment is dos equis and as a result the tenders here are going to start getting more and more customers asking for it so we are doing some promotion on that this evening
4076430 i came here in 1996 for winter holiday and fell in love with cayman and the kindness of the people one year later my twin sister joined me and we made cayman our home
4076431 when people are able to see this report in full they will understand some of the real experiences of caymans underclass
4076432 the executive summary was merely a snapshot and so far people have focused only on the numbers and the quantative element of the assessment
4076433 when we have the complete study here on island people will also begin to see the qualitative evidence there in and begin to understand what sort of problems people are facing everyday
4076434 this report tells us that many people in need are not just in need of cash it reflects the poverty of opportunity that many people persistently face
4076435 there are numerous real stories of the experiences of the underclass that many other people in cayman have no real concept of or are unaware even exist that we think will have a significant impact
4076436 people were distracted by the statistics from the summary but it is so much more complicated than that the completed report will offer a much fuller picture of what our society is like
4076437 we need nationally coordinated policies that address the real problems in the right way understanding that it is opportunity as much as it is money that is needed is very important and something that has been revealed by this report
4076438 what we have is a government simply trying to get political gain before an election and charles clifford is a lame duck minister trying to show that hes done something
4076439 they are thinking about short term gains while continuing to compromise the long term future of this country
4076440 is that where we want to put a cargo port is that what we want tourists to see
4076441 staging although he has declined to say how atlantic star will create eight acres on the downtown waterfront
4076442 anything you put in hog sty bay will affect seven mile beach
4076443 and this dirty port will boost traffic and its flow through the central business district and you have this cargo operation standing next to the passenger port
4076444 my understanding is that this is a quasi private financing initiative
4076445 but that seems odd when the ruling peoples progressive movement ppm took office and promised they would always use traditional financing
4076446 the money has to come from somewhere though and no one is going to lend hundreds of millions of dollars without significant interest and charges
4076447 we need to know what the true cost is they are going to pay this is really dangerous they are taking on massive amounts of debt and not thinking about 10 years and 20 years from now
4076448 in about 2003 we did a technical study that involved local people from thompson shipping and they said the only place for this was in east end wherever you put this port after all the ships are going to have to come
4076449 we just have to do the hard work and take the hard decision the cayman islands would not be the first place to create a port
4076450 a matter of pennies maybe four or five dollars with current fuel prices
4076451 mr clifford and this government have not achieved one thing with their go east campaign but with the port in east end you would certainly go east it would provide major development and increase land values and jobs and of course caymanian families still own most of the land in east end
4076452 our two oil plants esso and texaco and our gas plant home gas are in residential areas next to schools
4076453 this government has no vision charles clifford does not know what hes doing and doesnt want to do any work
4076454 to preserve natural environments and places of historic significance for present and future generations of the cayman islands
4076455 ce sont des chiffres auxquels on sattendait et qui ne sont pas bons
4076456 ce nest pas un ph nom ne propre l conomie fran aise
4076457 ne le cachons pas le risque dune r cession est d sormais tr s grand pour l conomie fran aise
4076458 toute personne qui crierait au loup et la r cession aurait un trimestre davance
4076459 la d gradation du pib tient surtout au plongeon de l investissement 2 9 pour linvestissement logement des m nages et 1 pour linvestissement des entreprises
4076460 nouvelle d gradation du pouvoir dachat donc de la consommation donc du pib puis de lemploi
4076461 ce qui mint resse cest ce qui va se passer demain
4076462 notre pr vision centrale dune hausse du pib de 1 7 pour lensemble de 2008 nest plus du tout tenable
4076463 le gouvernement a b ti son budget sur des hypoth ses de progression de lactivit qui sont aujourdhui particuli rement chim riques

4076467 the board is made up of a cross section of development orientated people specialists and academics we tried to get a mix of people
4076468 it is just another form of apartheid which serves one interest group
4076469 this is the challenge that we do not promote gated communities under the guise of cids
4076470 those for residential cids see it as their way of getting into partnership with local government
4076471 if the majority of residences sign up everybody will be obliged to pay the levy there may not be any freeloaders
4076472 joburg water does not go into private properties to take water samples
4076473 the code delineates what licensed nurses must know about their ethical responsibilities informs other health care professionals and members of the public about the ethical commitments of nurses and upholds their responsibilities informs other health care professionals and members of the public about the ethical commitments of nurses and upholds the responsibilities of being a self regulating profession
4076474 the pharmacist is obligated to serve the best interest of the public and of the profession and enhance public esteem of the profession
4076475 the code interprets these principles with respect to the responsibilities of its professionals to individual patients family and significant others colleagues and society
4076476 any abuse by a practitioner of any privileges and opportunities afforded to him or any grave dereliction of professional duty or serious breach of medical ethics may give rise to a charge of serious professional misconduct
4076477 i got into the league through sharlee henshaw when i first arrived on the island six months ago i had never even watched a game of rugby let alone played it before so i am a real beginner
4076478 i started playing the social non league occasionally on a friday and now on sunday afternoons to help me learn the game before joining the summer league this season
4076479 i was lucky to be accepted by two teams who didnt mind a novice player joining their squad
4076480 i love playing sports but never really played any when i was in the uk well not after leaving school i have always wanted to join a club but never got round to it back home but everyone here has been so friendly and patient with me while i try to learn the ropes and have helped me to improve
4076481 touch is such a great team game win or lose it is about having fun keeping fit making new friends and of course needless to say trying to win i got my very first try last week which was such a great feeling though was probably more luck than skill
4076482 i am so pleased that i have got into the touch and i really like the rugby club and finally i would like to say thanks to everyone at the rugby club for all their help and continued support
4076483 after analyzing digicels significant interest and investment in the sport we realized that our young enthusiasts needed a tailored program that focused on their own development in the sport as future players coaches and fans of the game
4076484 we thought of the kids clinic as the best and most practical way of bringing the sport to young fans who are often restricted from enjoying the major games at the stadium also what better mentors than the cayman national side
4076485 digicel a sponsor of caribbean football uses every effort to engage young lovers of the game in making the sport one of the caribbeans favourite pastime
4076486 but some may not be familiar with the requirements of tennis sometimes they may cheer too early which will interfere with the players i hope that next time maybe they can pay attention to that
4076487 what happened was that during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with out eyes
4076488 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture however some european media did not see it as such
4076489 it was my new personal best so i cant be mad about that
4076490 i know a lot of these guys like to take it out really fast i like to bring it home a little faster so to conserve my energy in the first 50 and then give it all i have in the second 50
4076491 he dropped four tenths of a second off his best time and he looked real strong in the water so we looked forward to the next swim
4076492 obviously michael is going to be the greatest athlete that has ever swam but i am definitely not intimidated by him
4076493 i know that i have got to do a couple things a bit better and train a little harder this is not one of my best events so i am just looking to have fun with it
4076494 im in good form and for the moment everything is going well
4076495 i am very confident as far as my chances are concerned in taking the gold medal home
4076496 it was my objective to try and get a quick time before the olympics
4076497 im happy to have done it i know im in good form
4076498 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
4076499 considering the current situations i cannot help but give up joining the race
4076500 i have been so happy with the team gold that had been my dream now this gold is just the icing on a perfect cake
4076501 they are having champagne while we here are drinking water
4076502 for pleasure after i have finished my work at the clinic at six or 6 30
4076503 brought marius up from a young horse and every year he does something fantastic for me he is my friend
4076504 i am so lucky riding is my hobby and i enjoy sitting on a horse
4076505 has only had a total of five fences in his life
4076506 and slightly hoping my teammates would get a very nasty bruise
4076507 remember once you go through that door the key may be lost to you forever
4076508 just pesto with pine nuts basil and parmesan but no dairy
4076509 you are not letting your moms comments affect you are you
4076510 tom brokaw called my dad whos ralph lauren and told him about the opportunity and thought it would be just the perfect match
4076511 i think it is quite an honor and something we were enthusiastic about right from the beginning
4076512 the challenge for us was in creating clothing for hundreds of athletes who are different sizes different body types
4076513 some are seven feet tall and some are under five some are gymnasts and some are weightlifters it is quite a feat
4076514 we were able to take the challenge on and create something that truly makes america look special and makes our athletes look like statesmen on a world stage
4076515 the clothes were great very american you know very formal
4076516 for jade its a chance to show that she is not a racist she is the first to admit that she did have her problems with shilpa but this will be like a role reversal and a chance to show india and the world what she is really like
4076517 so long its been nice knowing you alright so i stumbled upon this site a while ago and did some reading finally i decided to give it a try since i had the extra cash i jumped on the bandwagon and boy did i do it big time i bought the build your own deal and made a lady wonderwave then got the 3 for 2 deal which i chose a lady superribbed a butt speedbump and a mouth supertight threw in the lube for a year then felt sheepish and got the stu as well then on top of that i decided to throw in a sex in a can in lady just for shits and giggles my impreshions wowowowowowowow did i say wow ok it started off dry since the small box one of them came in would not stay lubed up and was deffinately not tight enough but what can you do then it was on to the main events can you say circus show i spent one and a half hours screwing every single one of those orifices the ejaculations got farther and farther apart in time but did not decline in force at all on any of them obviously the most stimulating one was the superribbed but the wonderwave overall felt the best also as everyone has said the stu is amazing it starts off slow but as you near the end weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee the only downfall of the whole experience was the lube yea i bought the lube for a year deal and that was a total waste of money i should have saved that and bought more astroglide the id and wet lubes are just terrible because they dry out so damn fast having to keep rubbing that on and filling the fleshlight every 5 minutes is a huge turnoff cause your hand you applied it with gets all sticky and so does the insert after the third one i switched over to the astroglide and had to lube twice at the most for each following insert my god astroglide is so much better i am sorry ilf but nobody buy id lube go to the drugstore and get some astroglide man my cock is tiered i will bet you though that it will be ready and willing for another session tomorrow but i dont think i am gonna do the pentathalon again my arm is sore i tell you what if i kept that up i would not have to go to the gym any more to work on my arms overall awesome pussies butts and mouths terrible lube i think i hear wanda calling my name laters
4076518 ok probably not a complete wife replacement since i would probably starve wear dirty clothes and generally be a mess but my new lady wonderwave is fantastic i received it in the mail today and had to try it out as soon as i got home a couple personal observations 1 dont try it dry the lube was invented for a purpose and that pupose is to not have the flesh of your cock stripped away due to dry friction apply sparingly or liberally but do apply some lube 2 do warm it before going for a flight unless you like your women on the cadaver side warm will feel much more natural and pleasureable 3 do enjoy your new toy somewhere private in case you get a bit vocal in your enjoyment or faint over from pleasure it is really that damn good i was a bit skeptical that it would feel so natural but after reading all the posts i thought id take a shot at it im already thinking about the ultratight butt hell fleshlight ought to just give away the first one they know you will be back for more thanks for a great product and thanks to the members here for giving insightful information and not making anyone feel like a pervert for wanting this toy
4076519 weve brought in some quality players and they give us a few more options when it comes to who we might put out
4076520 on the injury front pascal chimbonda kieran richardson danny higginbotham and phil bardsley have all shaken off niggly injuries and the only one who will definitely miss the start of the season is dwight yorke
4076521 i havent finalised what my selection will be for saturdays game but the lads have been in great form in training and theres real competition for places
4076522 of course there are a few areas where we want to strengthen and i think those have been well documented
4076523 but i dont expect to have any new faces in by the weekend
4076524 that of course can change by the hour and i know niall quinn and peter walker are working very hard in that direction
4076525 unfortunately babayaro is not what i need so there wont be anything going there i am not sure about jordi at the moment though weve had him here this week and you can see hes a decent player
4076526 apple knows how to design not just gadgets but the businesses that go around them
4076527 and as a result we wouldnt be surprised if apple is worth more than google within two years
4076528 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
4076529 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4076530 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4076531 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
4076532 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
4076533 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
4076534 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes
4076535 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
4076536 there is a good mixture of youth and experience around the place now
4076537 as one of the senior lads i have been drumming it into everyone else how important the start to the season will be
4076538 the stats show over the years that if you start poorly youll be punished somewhere along the line
4076539 if you look at our first three fixtures there is a chance we can give ourselves a decent head start and a chance of a better season
4076540 we have got a few old heads around and it is up to us to make sure the younger lads know exactly what is at stake come 3pm on saturday
4076541 i think it was definitely the right result and we created most of the chances their keeper made some top saves and if we had used a bit more composure on occasions the scoreline could have been greater
4076542 there is still some way to go in the final third for the goals the decisions that went into creating them came together and were correct at other times we played a cross behind a striker or picked the wrong pass and the chance was lost so we will keep working on those areas
4076543 im delighted for lee because before i came his last game against scunthorpe the crowd turned on him which was a large part of the reason i let him go to leicester
4076544 medicals dont take 10 minutes these days and we have to wait 24 hours for the results
4076545 the vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the processing of torrent files this can be exploited to cause a stack based buffer overflow by tricking the user into opening a torrent file containing an overly long created by field
4076546 open source programs have the same issues mind you the major ubuntu update required ssh to have blacklists and major security patches on keys
4076547 a population unaware of its rights and unable to understand them is a population exposed to exploitation and injustice
4076548 at the cmp of rs 268 heg trades at p e of 5 6x and ev ebitda of 3 8x discounting its fy10 estimates taking the average of fair values arrived by p e and ev ebitda methods we get a price of rs 277 hegs 36 stake in bel comes at rs 6 billion which we have discounted to 70 making it to rs 31 per share we initiate coverage with a buy recommendation on the stock with a 12 month price target of rs 308 which presents a 15 upside from current levels
4076549 one should not be moving into a private banking space right now right now meaning that already the nifty rallied about 20 from its lower levels and at that point of time private banking space was looking pretty attractive from a technical perspective but now those stocks have already reached their resistance levels so at this juncture i would say that yes if i have to buy anything in this market then i would rather buy technology or cairn rather than private banks although i personally hold hdfc bank in my portfolio but i wouldnt be buying afresh
4076550 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4076551 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4076552 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4076553 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4076554 i would like to propose and finalise this move of going public it would depend on investment requirement so initially it should not be less than rs 150 crore and could go up to rs 250 crore
4076555 seeing how you know how to do this ill let you ring up my groceries
4076556 demand for cosmetic plastic surgery continues to increase americans spent 11 5 billion for 11 million cosmetic procedures in 2006
4076557 your eyes receive more attention day in and day out then any other feature which is why blepharoplasty is such a frequently selected procedure by both men and women the drooping of upper eyelid skin results in a tired sad look
4076558 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4076559 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4076560 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4076561 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4076562 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4076563 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4076564 and if its the type of retailer that has great quality built into those house brands youre really saving yourself a lot of money and getting great value
4076565 larger packages are almost always a better value per ounce
4076566 can be a great savings as an alternative to going out to a restaurant
4076567 well its not a good idea if youre gonna throw it away
4076568 i mean its very simple if youre over purchasing if you buy 20 pounds of potatoes and youre only gonna use 5 pounds of them its not a good buy
4076569 obviously these products when theyre in big sizes sometimes look very attractive its worth the time to just check it out and make sure that youre getting the right product and something that you can use in a short period of time
4076570 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4076571 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4076572 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4076573 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4076574 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4076575 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4076576 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4076577 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4076578 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
4076579 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
4076580 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
4076581 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
4076582 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
4076583 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4076584 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4076585 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4076586 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4076587 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4076588 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4076589 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4076590 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4076591 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4076592 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4076593 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4076594 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4076595 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4076596 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4076597 heute wie damals bin ich davon berzeugt dass meine entscheidung vom fr hjahr richtig war eine zusammenarbeit mit der so genannten linken stellt f r mich einen durch nichts zu rechtfertigenden bruch unseres zentralen wahlversprechens dar und ist daher abzulehnen die glaubw rdigkeit der spd als volkspartei ist ein so hohes gut dass man in fragen der koalitionsaussagen nach der wahl zu dem stehen muss was man den w hlerinnen und w hlern vor der wahl versprochen hat

4076608 i made a few mistakes this weekend and made life difficult for myself but that second moto was really fun although tyla and i are fighting for the title it was the first head on race weve had all year
4076609 twenty points is not so much one mistake by tyla and im there
4076610 that was a really good fight with good clean passing i will fight for every point but im happy to go away with second i had some pretty bad crashes here the last few years and i didnt lose any points today
4076611 i got kicked sideways when i hit a bump on landing off a jump
4076612 aubin followed me through so i never got chance to shake him off in the end he put a good pass in but ive still got a good chance of the podium
4076613 ive felt good all weekend and its time i proved i can win outside japan too
4076614 i made a stupid crash on the first lap but the stronger motor that yamaha have made for us now was perfect and i found all the good lines
4076615 i certainly wasnt expecting to win the title this early in the season but im made up that ive won my second british title
4076616 the first day was horrendous like one long rut from start to finish there were a lot of the hard parts of the forest from old events that were used it was just a case of getting on with things as best you could it was horrible for everyone
4076617 i feel that one can buy cairn india once again since my feeling is that oil at one point of time was 30 higher than its 200 dma which is exponential as well as the simple moving average and now it has retraced all the way back down to its 200 dma the simple one was at usd 110 bbl and the exponential moving average was at usd 111 bbl this is going to bounce back and cairn would be the best bet to play on that rebound of oil my feeling is that oil is likely to move up say once it goes above usd 117 bbl then you will see usd 123 bbl to usd 129 bbl with an immediate target similarly for cairn rs 262 to about rs 280 possible if oil were to move up to something like usd 123 bbl to usd 129 bbl so cairn is my best bet in the current scenario
4076618 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4076619 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4076620 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4076621 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4076622 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4076623 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4076624 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4076625 we did overall rs 71 crore last year and if this trend continues we should get a 20 jump on that which would take us somewhere closer to rs 85 90 crore
4076626 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4076627 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4076628 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4076629 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4076630 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4076631 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4076632 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4076633 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4076634 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4076635 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4076636 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4076637 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4076638 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4076639 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4076640 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4076641 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4076642 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4076643 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4076644 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4076645 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4076646 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4076647 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4076648 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4076649 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4076650 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4076651 we hebben vooral betere wegen nodig om de toeristen en de goederen hier naartoe te krijgen het moet ook nog veiliger worden hoewel het hier nog niet eens zo slecht is
4076652 helaas gaat de hulp altijd naar de moeilijkere gebieden waar problemen en conflicten zijn daar stopt de internationale gemeenschap geld in
4076653 ze geven niets om bamiyan omdat het er veilig is maar de lokale bewoners hebben er genoeg van ze zijn teleurgesteld in de overheid en de internationale gemeenschap
4076654 our extensive experience with second life in corporate environment allowed ahg inc to start training program we share our expertise in a series of hands on courses that encompass corporate training hr marketing and other activities as related to corporate use of virtual worlds

4076658 the first group of pilgrims came at 10 oclock this morning

4076660 chi ha 2 pollici e se ne frega di quello che dici bob kelso
4076661 i feel that the move to ulster will be a great opportunity for both me and my family i am really looking forward to playing rugby in europe and for a team with such a vivid following as ulster the move is a great opportunity to see ireland and the uk and experience the famous northern ireland culture first hand and im sure well end up venturing across to mainland europe for holidays which we are all excited about
4076662 meeting new people and seeing new places is always exciting and i cant wait to join the rest of the squad and get stuck into some serious training for the new season but at the minute the person im most excited about meeting is my new son who is due in november were very excited about the new addition to our family
4076663 obviously it is good to be here and to have made the trip over for a couple of days to meet everybody i have had a great welcome it has been really professional in every respect the players are obviously preparing for the bath game but they have been really friendly towards me and professional in their approach to the game the one main thing i will take away from this brief visit is that ulster really is a club that knows where it is going and i am looking forward to being part of it
4076664 i want to add to the team as much as i can obviously everything is new to me so i need to settle in and fit in with the squad personally i want to play the best rugby that i can and in turn that should help the team
4076665 bj is a world class player and is one of the best tight head props in the game he was part of the south african squad that won the world cup and is used to being part of a winning team bj will bring with him the culture of excellence and winning a mindset i hope he can pass onto our younger players
4076666 over the last number of months ive spoken to him frequently and built up a good relationship so im delighted that after months of careful talks and deliberations on both sides we can finally announce brendons signing its very exciting news and i believe a real positive step for ulster rugby his signing with the club is a huge vote of confidence for ulster
4076667 i personally have found neil to be a joy to work with

4076673 because he has not expressed good judgment in the past and the pilipino community does not support him
4076674 the city adopted it and when you have multiple qualified strong candidates weve typically endorsed them we need to be as diverse a party as possible

4076680 a few days ago in our regular sunday afternoon game even though i write about playing better golf weekly and do my podcast on the best player at our club is a dentist mark spivey mark is a scratch player and has one of the best short games ive ever seen in an amateur and he makes everything with the putter he reads our difficult greens perfectly it seems so anytime he is over a putt of any length he has no doubt in his mind at all that he knows exactly where to start his ball and what pace it needs to have on it to take the roll he envisions and he makes lots of putts of all lengths mark is also very tall 64
4076681 and relaxed over the ball making a simple and clean back and through stroke is almost automatic
4076682 my arms and lose that natural swinging stroke that is so easy to repeat from hole to hole after noticing this with marks last hole putt i straightened up a bit allowed my arms to hang naturally from my shoulders and just began rolling putts right where i was looking again
4076683 and see if you can determine things theyre doing right

4076700 the best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago
4076701 the rates are much higher in baltimore than other areas of the state
4076702 there are a lot of lives to be saved by reducing cardiovascular disease you can connect the dots from high salt intake to excessive death rates in cardiovascular disease
4076703 we got criticized years ago for encouraging people not to smoke and many people argued it was a choice
4076704 but we feel that sodium consumption and hypertension are very similar to smoking in that people need to be protected from things that can harm them
4076705 if every option you have has too much salt in it you dont have much of a choice
4076706 im not saying every restaurant has this problem but if there are not enough low salt options then what kind of choice is it
4076707 a lot of people dont know whats in the food they are eating
4076708 its hard to hold them responsible if they are not getting the information to make a wise decision
4076709 if this doesnt help our confidence i dont know what will
4076710 it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax
4076711 just because a bill comes to the floor with offshore and energy in the title doesnt mean its a good offshore drilling bill
4076712 speaker pelosi is only going to schedule a vote on an offshore energy bill if she believes it would be politically perilous not to and even then its not going to have much energy in it
4076713 and ill bet you when members come back from their districts youll find more movement taking place
4076714 its nonsensical that its safe to drill off the coast of texas and louisiana and mississippi and yes california but its not safe to drill anywhere else the average hardworking american doesnt understand that
4076715 always concerned about the push for more drilling off our coasts from the oil industry and its supporters
4076716 a huge erosion of support for the moratorium among democrats
4076717 people are roaming around and enjoying themselves until this year
4076718 is consistent with the fact that gas prices were going up so quickly and to such a high level
4076719 i used to drive to vegas once a month twice a month but not anymore
4076720 i saw where oil prices were up 3 today so i figured id better fill my car up before the price went back up
4076721 rasanya dulu tempat ini lebih luas dari sekarang dan kursi serta mejanya lebih besar

4076933 as a result we didnt have the luxury of waiting for the final report we had to cast a pretty wide net on these projects and we feel these requests are for logical things that can be done now and that are common to future solutions if we are accused of making some assumptions well i dont think the residents of the city would want us to miss the opportunity to apply for this funding as we wait for the final report
4076934 the real question is what business is everyone going to be in

4076945 so after they had prayed and fasted they placed their hands on them and sent them off
4076946 but after the disciples had gathered around him he got up and went back to the city

4076993 were going to share some ideas on how to move the process forward
4076994 i understand they have put puryear in the controversial category
4076995 its very rare for a district court nominee to become controversial usually they just fly through
4076996 groups can attack a nominee but youll never see the nominee respond to anything except at hearings
4076997 as far as his qualifications go he was at the top of his class in law school he clerked on the u s court of appeals he has legislative experience in the u s senate he manages litigation for a big fortune 500 company and the aba american bar association rated him as qualified

4077015 manifest failure of the chinese government to keep their promises
4077016 im not asking about how well the games are being run or how wonderful the games are
4077017 are you embarrassed by china i dont think anyone thinks you have answered the question
4077018 the olympic games is largely about the athletes and they have given us extremely strong feedback about how things are going
4077019 were not getting anywhere are we are the ioc embarrassed about the chinese governments record on human rights one more chance
4077020 we have to note the enormous steps in the wider area the world is watching and the ioc is appraising
4077021 people enjoy more freedom people are living a good life everyone is happy thats a fact
4077022 of course there are exceptions like in any other country but they need to take the legal process and procedures to resolve any issues we cannot allow this country to be in chaos
4077023 but there are a few people who have come here to peek to be critical to dig into the small details and find fault
4077024 this does not mean that we are not fulfilling our promises over human rights to the ioc the whole country can see how can china has developed how china has genuinely welcomed the world to enjoy everything with us
4077025 i did not promise that china would promise to do whatever with the games in china i did not say that
4077026 i think the games will open up the horizon about china people will see better what china is about

4077041 nunca pens que ganar a la carrera ya estaba lo suficientemente contenta con haber llegado a la final y mejorado mi propia marca
4077042 sab a que lo iba a hacer bien en la final pero la verdad el resultado fue m s de lo que esperaba fue completamente sorprendente
4077043 no es el tipo de deportista del que debes estar pendiente para que lo de todo de s en los entrenamientos
4077044 competir lado a lado con jiao liuyang me produjo la sensaci n de que estaba practicando como de costumbre eso impidi que me sintiera nerviosa y me ayud a mejorar mi desempe o
4077045 durante varios meses ha estado entrenando en la altura con el nico objetivo de lograr algo especial en los juegos ol mpicos creo que siempre tendr s oportunidades de ganar en la medida en que te atrevas a desearlo

4077047 existe una nica v ctima que es neira y su familia y un agresor que est acusado de las grav simas lesiones y tambi n existe la posible negligencia en la actuaci n de determinados hospitales de la comunidad de madrid
4077048 a nuestro entender los hechos est n clar simos en cuanto a la situaci n que nos preocupa que es la agresi n que sufri jes s y la mala asistencia m dica
4077049 hay que tener en cuenta otros criterios para saber si su conducta en ese momento de la agresi n era consciente
4077050 nosotros consideramos que l era perfectamente consciente y que act a de esa manera porque quiere causar el m ximo da o a jes s con lo que su conducta es dolosa y no se puede hablar de imprudencia
4077051 no ha negado los hechos en ning n momento y desde que fue detenido declar que hab a pegado a un hombre
4077052 servir como testigo de una agresi n que su v ctima se niega a reconocer
4077053 afortunadamente cuando no se cuenta con la declaraci n de las v ctimas pues es muy habitual que las v ctimas no declaren contra sus agresores est la prueba de los testigos que han presenciado las cosas

4077057 was characterized by decreasing household final consumption expenditure and smaller
4077058 clearly the growth dip in spring could have been worse
4077059 for the second half of this year we believe in moderate and clearly below potential growth but not in an outright recession
4077060 the government can stick to its deliberately cautious growth forecast of 1 7 percent for this year
4077061 estou tranq ilo consciente de que at hoje dei o meu melhor desde que comecei a jogar sempre quis representar o brasil foram cinco jogos ol mpicos se n o ganhei medalha tudo bem sempre com os p s no ch o sabia que era dif cil sei que tenho chance de ajudar o brasil
4077062 o resultado surpreendeu at a mim porque tive uma fratura no tornozelo direito em outubro do ano passado e fiquei cinco meses sem treinar
4077063 para mim cada edi o dos jogos foi uma experi ncia nova mas nesta eu senti menos o frio na barriga todos os jogos ol mpicos foram magn ficos o momento mais marcante na minha hist ria nos jogos foi em 1996 quando ganhei do persson que tinha sido campe o mundial em 91 e era um dos favoritos ao ouro na disputa individual
4077064 eu ainda estava abalado pela morte do claudio kano que era como se fosse meu irm o e ele est comigo at hoje tudo o que eu fa o visando ao melhor para o t nis de mesa que era o que ele queria tamb m

4077078 the worst loneliness is to not be comfortable with yourself
4077079 they expressly authorize the fbi to engage in intelligence collection inside the united states
4077080 there was clear eyed and bipartisan recognition after the attacks that we needed to be able and allowed to collect intelligence in the united states
4077081 under the new guidelines the investigative steps that the fbi may take in a particular investigation will not be driven by irrelevant factors such as the type of paperwork the agent uses to open the investigation
4077082 that is why i am so happy being where i am despite coming second
4077083 i always come out of my races knowing i gave it everything this morning is no exception sullivan said i gave it 100 per cent and it was just not good enough full credit to alain he swam a great race swum me out of it and deserved to win
4077084 i think the excitement caught up with me and i probably used a little bit more energy than i should have in the first 50 i was not out as fast as i should have been either i knew he was a strong finisher and i tried to hold on but was not good enough on the day

4077088 i understand they have put puryear in the controversial category
4077089 groups can attack a nominee but youll never see the nominee respond to anything except at hearings

4077094 im glad the judiciary committee is taking a closer look at mr puryear as a candidate because the issues we raised are legitimate issues
4077095 you always say such weird things who thinks about things like that
4077096 and if it does the sea is just there were not scientists were idols we dont have to think about these things
4077097 ik dacht bij mezelf hoor ik dit goed mijn zusje is 14 en jullie zijn een stelletje pedofielen
4077098 maar onze ouders hebben ons wel geleerd om te waarderen wat we krijgen
4077099 saya sudah berusaha mengatasi pukulan pukulan dia tetapi dia lebih agresif
4077100 een probleem in het seksleven is vaak een voorbode van een belangrijker gezondheidsprobleem
4077101 ik hoop mijn supporters zo snel mogelijk uitsluitsel te geven
4077102 de arbeiders werkten zonder bescherming en moesten het asbest eerst met krabbers en nadien met een hogedrukreiniger verwijderen
4077103 zij hebben een zeer groot gezondheidsrisico gelopen dankzij een anonieme tip van een veiligheidsco rdinator die het brussels instituut voor milieubeheerheeft ingelicht zijn we op de feiten gestoten na een jaar onderzoek hebben we al vijf arbeiders kunnen terugvinden maar we zijn nog op zoek naar minstens n man de ploegleider
4077104 die ploegleider zal ons zeer waarschijnlijk meer kunnen vertellen over het verloop van de werken wie heeft de opdracht gegeven om dat asbest te verwijderen wist de ploegleider zelf over welk product het ging of wist zijn opdrachtgever dat dat zijn vragen waarop we het antwoord nog willen kennen bovendien moeten alle arbeiders zo snel mogelijk een aantal onderzoeken ondergaan om te zien hoe het met hun gezondheid gesteld is
4077105 dat gaat om celstraffen tot n jaar en boetes tot 500 000 euro als blijkt dat hier een economische logica achter zat dat het op deze manier gebeurd is om geld uit te sparen zal ik in ieder geval zeer zware straffen eisen
4077106 we hebben de laatste jaren een tiental dossiers over asbest gehad en in de meeste gevallen gaat het om overschrijding van de normen van de milieuvergunning een dergelijk dossier waar zo een grote hoeveelheid asbest op een dergelijke bijna misdadige manier is verwijderd hebben we nog nooit gezien
4077107 he was faithful unto death by request of martha berry
4077108 were not even halfway into the games right now and were a second half team weve always been a second half team
4077109 there are kids that were hoping for a couple by now and so we were hoping for the same medals they were
4077110 it hasnt worked out yet but there are lots of kids on the field of play next week that may make up the difference
4077111 youve got to be competing against these people setting these world records as much as you can every year each year leading up to the games
4077112 so when you get in the pool with them youre up at their level because youve competed with them so regularly
4077113 i played in a football league and you dont call the game until the gun goes in the fourth quarter
4077114 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4077115 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know former pennsylvania governor tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4077116 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than new york city mayor michael bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4077117 should they abort in the first trimester or wait and have a partial birth abortion
4077118 because some of the most pernicious intellectual criminals of the past century wore red they have escaped condemnation
4077119 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4077120 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4077121 this is like something you would see in new york or pennsylvania or california but not here
4077122 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
4077123 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4077124 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
4077125 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
4077126 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
4077127 were proud of anyone who has worked on the side of angels in fledgling democracies
4077128 youve got a gun pointed at your head what do you do what do you do
4077129 i have to warn you ive learned that relationships that begin under intense circumstances never last
4077130 discuss how the failed policies of the last eight years have betrayed our values and left an economy out of balance
4077131 ill fight this guy until the day i die for the people of winslow township
4077132 if you asked me why i left the democratic party its because of people like russell bates
4077133 in my 20 years this is the tightest election ive ever seen
4077134 we have a series of really unexpected and unusual circumstances nothing in winslow is typical
4077135 i guess theyre trying to blackball russell bates and beat him up so everybody else just stands back
4077136 i cant remember a year when i didnt do one
4077137 were living with mr bates mistakes when he served up here for 23 years allowing the water and sewer department to drive itself into the ground
4077138 he had a chance to do something about it and he did a bad job
4077139 hes going to blame me for water and sewer rates i havent been on the committee in five years as soon as he got on he was spending money
4077140 a person like me whos totally with my children all day its great to open my eyes to whats going on to get involved
4077141 the idea is that we would open this convention up to the public
4077142 hopefully it will be one of the things that shows were out talking and are interested in what regular people have to say and the problems in their lives right now
4077143 one thing we do were asking people to volunteer for the campaign
4077144 if you are i will make note of it we always need extra help were building teams right now
4077145 what would the point be if we got the word out to our supporters and only people who are politically active came down
4077146 we thought it would serve more of a purpose to talk to people who were just here but may be interested in whats going on and may have a question to ask
4077147 i think its something thats getting more and more prevalent
4077148 i think were getting to the point where the word retard or retarded is used to describe anything undesirable or anything stupid
4077149 sometimes i think the word has almost lost its meaning
4077150 i hear a lot of teenagers using the word now like they dont know at all what it means
4077151 the great disappointment from our point of view is that the movie made it this far without this issue even coming up
4077152 were not making a play for pity were not making a play to be the language police but as long as you perpetuate that stereotype it has a very damaging effect on people with intellectual disabilities
4077153 i hear the word retarded its basically like putting people down
4077154 ive felt that way when i was called retarded i just wasnt motivated it hurts my feelings very deeply
4077155 do you really think man clawed his way to the top of the food chain to eat soy
4077156 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers

4077173 i have contacted many members of the westmoreland county republican committee and there is overwhelming support for ms ward myself included
4077174 after much thought and consideration and many calls asking me to enter the partys nomination process to replace sen regola i have decided to do so
4077175 but this unexpected turn of events and outpouring of calls of encouragement from friends and strangers has led me to believe it is something that needed to be done
4077176 with great doubts about whether or not their interests are being represented in harrisburg
4077177 and david and all israel went to jerusalem which is jebus where the jebusites were the inhabitants of the land
4077178 as for the jebusites the inhabitants of jerusalem the children of judah could not drive them out but the jebusites dwell with the children of judah at jerusalem to this day
4077179 now the children of judah fought against jerusalem and took it they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire
4077180 but the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites who inhabited jerusalem so the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin in jerusalem to this day
4077181 and the king and his men went to jerusalem against the jebusites the inhabitants of the land who spoke to david saying you shall not come in here but the blind and the lame will repel you
4077182 as was characteristic of all the great walled cities of canaan
4077183 jerusalem had a vertical water shaft connecting with a tunnel leading to an underground water supply outside the walls as necessary as these systems were for the survival of a city under siege they also constituted a major weakness in that they provided access into the city for anyone who could find the entrance
4077184 whoever climbs up by way of the water shaft and defeats the jebusites
4077185 and joab the son of zeruiah went up first and became chief then david dwelt in the stronghold therefore they called it the city of david
4077186 the capture of jerusalem by david is of interest to archaeologists
4077187 since he used a strategy which involved the gihon spring on the eastern slope of mount zion joab went up first and was rewarded by becoming commander of davids army
4077188 this tunnel has been identified with warrens shaft the shaft was dug through the limestone above the gihon spring all the way up to the surface a distance of 24 meters the discovery of a jebusite wall farther down the slope toward the gihon spring increases the possibility that joab could have secretly entered the city through warrens shaft
4077189 who suspects that the figure of king david is about as historical as king arthur
4077190 its not often that an archaeological find makes the front page of the new york times to say nothing of time magazine
4077191 there avraham biran and his team of archaeologists found a remarkable inscription from the ninth century b c e that refers both to the house of david and to the king of israel this is the first time that the name david has been found in any ancient inscription outside the bible
4077192 as someone who studies ancient inscriptions in the original i have a responsibility to warn the lay audience that the new fad the deconstructionist school is merely a circle of dilettantes their view that nothing in biblical tradition is earlier than the persian period 540 330 b c especially their denial of the existence of a united monarchy is a figment of their vain imagination the name house of david in the tel dan and mesha inscriptions sounds the death knell to their specious conceit biblical scholarship and instruction should completely ignore the deconstructionist school they have nothing to teach us
4077193 for whatever things were written before were written for our learning that we through the patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope
4077194 sure this is all well and good and these are great ideas but is anything going to come of it or will all our work just sit in a binder somewhere collecting dust
4077195 people are always looking for the newest way to earn cash for the least amount of work
4077196 currently the government is studying the report before making any decision
4077197 the non existence of kadhi courts is a constraint in solving basic issues concerning muslims
4077198 it should be remembered that ccm went around all over the country during the 2005 general elections asking for votes on a promise that it would work for the re establishment of the courts they won the votes and it is their responsibility to fulfill the promise
4077199 this will cause us problems i think government should be left to handle its core responsibility of security and social prosperity

4077244 i am privy to many discussions that i cannot share for now based on that i have ample reasons to suggest that although we have been derailed somewhat because of all these episodes we can make it
4077245 those in the ruling establishment including the igp inspector general of police and his coterie of loyal clique must be convinced otherwise they wouldnt be desperate to go on this move to charge him
4077246 they are convinced that were going to make it so they have to make sure that i am stopped at all costs
4077247 if it involves 2 000 acres and two billion ringgit its just not my right to forgive they have to return the money but otherwise we cannot afford to drag the entire country back to the past

4077266 on behalf of the government of canada it is with great sadness that i extend my heart felt sympathies to the family and friends of the two canadian aid workers with the international rescue committee who were brutally killed today in afghanistan as well as to the friends and family of their afghan and american colleagues who also lost their lives
4077267 knowing the risks associated with working in a conflict zone these humanitarian aid workers gave selflessly to help improve the lives of the afghan people their spirits will live on in the continued efforts of all who are assisting in the reconstruction of afghanistan
4077268 this cowardly attack on unarmed aid workers yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent canada remains steadfast in our commitment to the people of afghanistan and will continue to work with the afghan government and the international community to improve the lives of afghans

4077514 any team that can win their groups at the olympics are quite strong these teams are basically chinas primary opponents
4077515 maybe overall china is stronger but on an individual basis theyve beaten us before in singles matches or other contests
4077516 the olympics isnt any ordinary competition theres definitely more pressure
4077517 i didnt play to my full potential but it was good training for me psychologically
4077518 when i was behind 1 0 and even when i was trailing in the second game to be able to come back from that psychologically that was good for me i think itll be helpful for the upcoming games
4077519 were not even halfway into the games right now and were a second half team weve always been a second half team
4077520 there are kids that were hoping for a couple by now and so we were hoping for the same medals they were
4077521 it hasnt worked out yet but there are lots of kids on the field of play next week that may make up the difference
4077522 youve got to be competing against these people setting these world records as much as you can every year each year leading up to the games
4077523 so when you get in the pool with them youre up at their level because youve competed with them so regularly
4077524 i played in a football league and you dont call the game until the gun goes in the fourth quarter
4077525 in this extremely difficult mortgage environment we are pleased to continue to report a profit we also remain confident that the monetization of our mortgage loan portfolio will continue to occur without a material loss
4077526 prior to 2007 the company was externally advised in early 2006 i recommended and the board of directors approved the suspension of new sub prime mortgage originations and investments this was the correct strategy during 2007 our new management team promptly recognized asset impairments and reduced borrowings with free cash flow in the first half of 2008 these actions restored profitability and prevented material asset write downs
4077527 when we gain ul and fcc approvals the manufacturers we are in discussions with will be able to rapidly integrate our design for a dimmable cfl into its production line with minimal modifications shortening the lag time between a licensing agreement and bringing an actual product powered by purespectrum technology to market
4077528 by enabling the manufacturers to quickly introduce a dependable dimmable cfl product we will also accelerate the realization of substantial revenue generation from licensing agreements for purespectrum it is our expectation that multiple manufacturers will bring dimmable cfl products built with purespectrum technology to market by the first quarter of 2009
4077529 we have recognized a heightened sense of urgency surrounding the issue of dimming and we believe building product prototypes will enable manufacturers to realize their objective more quickly
4077530 at the same time the process of constructing a full line of dimmable purespectrum cfl products will allow us the chance to more readily introduce our dimmable technology to additional manufacturers
4077531 i am pleased our revenues have once again increased for the quarter and we have now continued our profitability for the second straight quarter i believe we can continue to grow our business and remain profitable
4077532 the ones who are playing are in the water and theyre going to do a good job for sure im going to prepare the team the next couple of days for the game against greece but execution is coming from the players in the water
4077533 we came to an idea to do something special that will be only ours
4077534 and we agreed because we are a team we fight for each other and we die for each other and we wanted to do something not so usual among other teams
4077535 croatia is at the moment the favourite for the final
4077536 after missing the first couple it seemed like i kept forcing it it was totally in my head not taking the time to relax and put it where i needed to put it
4077537 they are enjoying it and joking with this its a good dose of atmosphere for the team they said ok we have two months together and we are watching these same faces each day so we will change a little bit of the face to change something that was the reason
4077538 overall i am pleased with our fiscal year 2008 results as the business fundamentals in the operating units continued to be solid throughout the year and remained solid during the fourth quarter particularly in light of the market conditions in which they were achieved our full year non gaap earnings per share of 1 42 were within our latest earnings per share guidance of 1 35 to 1 45 non gaap which excludes one time transition expenses we finished the year 0 21 per share higher than the mid point of our original guidance provided approximately one year ago the first half of fiscal year 2008 was driven by significantly higher than expected trading volumes and the one time benefit from both termination fees and the timing of our ramp up in spending to build out our public company corporate infrastructure and investments the second half of our fiscal year was driven by solid operating fundamentals in the core investor communication business which represents over 70 of our revenues and earnings even in the current market environment i am confident in our ability to extend our market leadership position as we move into our 2009 fiscal year
4077539 i am pleased that our operating units are projected to continue to generate solid performance in our 2009 fiscal year with steady revenue growth in every quarter despite a challenging market environment when i consider the benefits from last years one time items in the non core areas of the business which were part of our over plan performance in fiscal year 2008 i am satisfied with the business units growth in our overall plan as we are expecting revenue and margin improvement in our consolidated core business units
4077540 as we move into our 2009 fiscal year i am excited about our strong market position in the core investor communication business and our prospects in that business segment as well as the prospects in our securities processing business segments as we continue to gain traction with our unique outsourcing offering we will use our strong cash flow to create value by completing strategic acquisitions paying an increased dividend and buying back an amount of shares to offset the dilution created by our equity compensation plans

4077602 i am a palestinian woman and my husband is also palestinian he has worked for the past year in the united arab emirates but when he came back to egypt he stayed away from his children during the summer holiday its haram that we live away from each other for more than seven months now
4077603 i appeal to egyptian president husni mubarak to his wife mrs susan mubarak and to palestinian authority president abu mazen mahmoud abbas to end our suffering and allow these stranded people out as well as lift the siege on gaza its haram wallah i swear its haram that my children are kept away from their father

4077605 it is a message for the whole world about what is happening in palestine under the occupation and under the siege in gaza and we will work hard with our companions and friends to spread a message that palestine is not only the problem of the siege its the problem of occupation this is the time for the international moral conscious to be awakened and spread a message for peace and justice in palestine

4077675 imtech is met heel veel activiteiten actief in een aantal marktsegmenten die daar bijna ongevoelig voor zijn zoals zorg veiligheid en de olie en gasindustrie

4077677 dat is nu niet het geval we kunnen ook niet zeggen wanneer we dat eventueel kunnen gaan voelen op dit moment merken we er ten opzichte van onze orderportefeuille in ieder geval helemaal niks van
4077678 op dit moment hebben we een longlist van circa 25 a 30 bedrijven we kijken meer naar kleinere en middelgrote bedrijven dan naar hele grote partijen om over te nemen
4077679 dat heeft geen gevolgen voor de prijs van over te nemen partijen we worden gemiddeld eens per week benaderd door bedrijven die overgenomen willen worden en onze kwaliteit kennen

4077685 de ontwikkelingen in het eerste halfjaar van 2008 bevestigen de door friesland foods in het jaarverslag 2007 uitgesproken verwachting dat in 2008 met name in azi en afrika de margedruk zal aanhouden als gevolg van de hoge grondstofkosten verder blijkt dat de opbrengstprijzen meer dan in het verleden fluctueren en dat kleine veranderingen in vraag en aanbod leiden tot grotere prijsschommelingen in vooral melk en weipoeder kaas en boter

4077687 als je ons vergelijkt met andere meldingsplichtige bedrijven dan zit rsdb nog steeds aan de bovenkant van de markt maar de marges zullen ook in de tweede helft onder druk staan en er is sprake van prijserosie dat zal in de rest van 2008 tot uitdrukking komen in de resultaten
4077688 de financiering van de overname bevindt zich in de afrondingsfase aandeelhouders zijn in meerderheid akkoord en dus is er weinig reden te veronderstellen dat de overname niet doorgaat
4077689 we hebben de koers van quebecor nadat wij een bod deden op de europese printtak scherp zien dalen omdat het bedrijf veel afschrijvingen moest doen en omdat wellicht de prijs die wij boden te laag werd gevonden bovendien kreeg het bedrijf een financiering van 1 mrd niet rond quebecor zou in onze deal een belang van bijna 30 in rsdb krijgen voor hhbv was dat aspect reden om niet te participeren in deze stap omdat hhbv geen deelneming wil in bedrijven met een beursnotering
4077690 maar consolidatie bleef noodzakelijk en toen de aandeelhouder de overname niet goedkeurde
4077691 in het merendeel van onze zones werd er in het tweede kwartaal jaar op jaar beter gepresteerd dan in het eerste kwartaal en zoals verwacht neemt het volume in brazilie weer toe 3 8 na een traag begin dit jaar

4077695 bij de huidige prijsniveaus deze afboekingen of gerealiseerde verliezen op aandelen in de komende kwartalen naar verwachting aanzienlijk zullen toenemen
4077696 gezien de aanhoudende turbulentie in de mondiale financiele markten met sterk dalende aandelenmarkten beperkte toegang tot liquiditeit en stijgende rente
4077697 de gerealiseerde verliezen op de aandelenportefeuille zullen aanhouden de financieringskosten zullen stijgen onze vastgoedfinanciering kan te maken krijgen met tegenvallers in deze onzekere tijden het einde van de financiele crisis is nog niet in zicht

4077719 even an entire society a nation or all simultaneously existing societies taken together are not owners of the earth they are simply its possessors its beneficiaries and have to bequeath it in an improved state to succeeding generations
4077720 new society will have emerged from capitalist society which is thus in every respect economically morally and intellectually still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges
4077721 todays consumers are remodeling instead of selling their homes with the recent decline of home prices consumers are spending more time at home and they want to upgrade their surroundings we advise caution when hiring a general contractor and design team because consumers are investing tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars a prepared consumer will save money and avoid costly mistakes if they learn what questions to ask
4077722 with todays investor demands and level of sophistication it was imperative that we as a company provide real time and efficient solutions relationship management is key in this industry this system will enable us to better focus on the unique needs of our clients
4077723 since the application is built to resemble tools we already use such as microsoft outlook and offers tremendous integration capabilities it was an easy decision to move ahead with the implementation
4077724 from our very first conversation with christopher bentley and his team it was clear they understood how to use technology
4077725 the standard of excellence in service for their clients is already part of their long held processes methods and dna this system is just the tool to support them as they endeavor to elevate and differentiate their level of service even further many companies try to put the cart before the horse and expect technology alone to improve the client experience it was refreshing to work with a team who already had the vision and the practice of providing superior service and we just focused on how to systematize it bentley clearly understands what crm means for themselves and their customers

4077731 i have been blown away with the extraordinary number of enquiries we are receiving via the website i am amazed at the number of potential customers who have visited either melbourne or queensland display centres and have made contact asking when metricon will be available in nsw without exception these people are very impressed with what they have seen
4077732 i am excited to say the metricon sales office will be open for business in january 2009 located in kellyville

4077736 sometimes our customers are a bit overwhelmed by the number of choices they have when they come to our site
4077737 weve got 16 grain choices 300 sizes lots of custom features it really adds up so weve come up with this easy to use tool that helps our customers focus on the products theyre most likely to like

4077741 its building versus land finding a balance that suits both requirements
4077742 more developers are turning to structured parking facilities to make previously unacceptable sites feasible for use structured parking provides consolidated and convenient parking which allows for the creation of more green space as well as the ability to reduce water contamination preclude the overloading of drainage systems and recharge the aquifer
4077743 parking is a huge concern when repurposing older manufacturing facilities in many cases original parking areas werent planned for high density occupation or the facility is situated in a land scarce industrial park
4077744 structured parking can provide a cost land and environmentally effective solution for repurposing
4077745 these amenities are becoming a requirement as society is considering land use and its impact on the environment developers are looking for ways to get the most out of the land they occupy many are looking at their parking situations and how to increase their effectiveness
4077746 there is now a desire for the consolidation of vehicles into multi modal centers in an effort to reduce mans carbon footprint multi purposing parking facilities with the integration of technology and looking at roofscapes as additional area for various applications is essentially added value found space
4077747 concrete cracks are usually nothing to worry about cracking is a normal and acceptable part of the curing process caused by shrinking or settling
4077748 however if moisture or water is present if theres mold or if the crack is getting wider the situation should be addressed
4077749 moisture may be a sign that ground water is not draining properly homeowners need to make sure that gutters and downspouts are clean and free flowing downspout extenders and a yard that is sloped properly will also keep rainwater from settling against the foundation
4077750 in my opinion thats an antiquated approach its a rare situation where excavation is necessary new technologies exist that allow us to easily repair cracks even wet cracks from the inside quickly permanently and for a lot less money than youd expect
4077751 do it yourselfers cant duplicate our results using store bought products besides attempting to repair a crack shouldnt be considered a weekend warrior project it should be done by a trained professional
4077752 for garages floors sidewalks and other non decorative surfaces we use coatings that conceal cracks and hide them very well the coatings come in a wide variety of colors so we can match the surrounding concrete
4077753 i hear it all the time from people i thought it would be a bigger deal
4077754 people put up with cracks for years because they are worried about the cost for hundreds of dollars rather than thousands the problems caused by concrete cracks can go away forever

4077787 diciamoci la verit cari amici cattolici del centrodestra e del centrosinistra il bersaglio nemmeno tanto implicito di famiglia cristiana siamo noi inutile polemizzare su una parola una immagine o una citazione degli editorialisti della rivista che da tempo per la verit ha deciso di essere coscienza critica del potere forse perch pi pochi ancora lo sono
4077788 che la colpa come dice tremonti sia del dilagante pensiero unico mercatista oppure della paura di parte del ceto politico di pronunciare parole e giudizi anticonformisti sta di fatto che la cultura cristiana in questo paese sta rivelandosi sempre pi come la cultura dellalterit e della difesa delluomo altro che cattocomunismo
4077789 lattacco concentrico a famiglia cristiana di alcuni esponenti della destra non risolve i problemi che sta attraversando il governo non passa attraverso laccusa di comunisti a tutti quelli che contestano lazione del governo la soluzione alle difficolt crescenti denunciate dalle famiglie italiane semmai gasparri bondi e giovanardi prendano atto che anche nel mondo cattolico c un forte pluralismo politico e chi non la pensa come la destra non necessariamente un cripto o un proto comunista

4077819 de arbeiders werkten zonder bescherming en moesten het asbest eerst met krabbers en nadien met een hogedrukreiniger verwijderen
4077820 zij hebben een zeer groot gezondheidsrisico gelopen dankzij een anonieme tip van een veiligheidsco rdinator die het brussels instituut voor milieubeheerheeft ingelicht zijn we op de feiten gestoten na een jaar onderzoek hebben we al vijf arbeiders kunnen terugvinden maar we zijn nog op zoek naar minstens n man de ploegleider
4077821 die ploegleider zal ons zeer waarschijnlijk meer kunnen vertellen over het verloop van de werken wie heeft de opdracht gegeven om dat asbest te verwijderen wist de ploegleider zelf over welk product het ging of wist zijn opdrachtgever dat dat zijn vragen waarop we het antwoord nog willen kennen bovendien moeten alle arbeiders zo snel mogelijk een aantal onderzoeken ondergaan om te zien hoe het met hun gezondheid gesteld is
4077822 dat gaat om celstraffen tot n jaar en boetes tot 500 000 euro als blijkt dat hier een economische logica achter zat dat het op deze manier gebeurd is om geld uit te sparen zal ik in ieder geval zeer zware straffen eisen
4077823 we hebben de laatste jaren een tiental dossiers over asbest gehad en in de meeste gevallen gaat het om overschrijding van de normen van de milieuvergunning een dergelijk dossier waar zo een grote hoeveelheid asbest op een dergelijke bijna misdadige manier is verwijderd hebben we nog nooit gezien

4077911 how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy the effects are apparent in many countries improvident habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as a child a wife or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men individual moslems may show splendid qualities but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it no stronger retrograde force exists in the world far from being moribund mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith it has already spread throughout central africa raising fearless warriors at every step and were it not that christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science the science against which it had vainly struggled the civilization of modern europe might fall as fell the civilization of ancient rome

4077956 weve had pretty stable rules for the past few years and that is exactly what has happened
4077957 there are still those doing a better job but in the midfield group there are times when you have half a second from seventh to 20th its incredibly close
4077958 if you compare qualifying this year to last year across all the teams the average improvement is 0 2 seconds whereas were more like 1 4 seconds
4077959 mclaren and ferrari are still at the front but they are generally the teams that have made the least improvement so you would say those improvements are getting harder to find
4077960 my opinion is that next year it will be much more spread out because people will be getting used to the rules
4077961 i was devastated because this is my main source of income for my family it was just devastating to us i was physically ill literally i just thought i was going to pass out once these chickens are shipped out in about four weeks this chicken farm will basically be out of business

4078017 this means that consultees must be given enough information to enable them to make an intelligent response and this information must be accurate and not misleading
4078018 we are arguing that the post offices consultation document for cornwall is both flawed and materially misleading it contains a number of major errors such as the wrong population figures for the county and including the isles of scilly and dartmoor in the cornwall plan
4078019 this is seriously misleading and does not enable consultees to direct their representations to which branch or branches if any should close instead of their local branch
4078020 it means that any community trying to persuade the post office not to close their local branch are likely to point to alternative candidates for closure in cornwall alone rather than looking at the picture for cornwall and dorset combined
4078021 we feel that these flaws are fundamental to the fairness of the whole process as a result we have written to the post office asking them to abandon the current consultation exercise in cornwall and to abstain from making any decision to close any branches in the county unless and until a fair and lawful consultation exercise has first been carried out

4078053 as far as his qualifications go he was at the top of his class in law school he clerked on the u s court of appeals he has legislative experience in the u s senate he manages litigation for a big fortune 500 company and the aba american bar association rated him as qualified

4078070 you know i know it rained the first day but quite honestly i dont understand why we dont play such a big tournament over 10 days maybe
4078071 thats the only regret i have at the moment because i think this is asking just a little bit too much and too much trouble
4078072 theyve made it very hard on us players and i wish there were extra days for us to play

4078087 i was giving him some icy hot and somehow some got inside his helmet so he was standing out there at practice going crazy scratching his head he thought i did it on purpose
4078088 i had the psychological advantage because my opponent is stronger than me so i have no pressure
4078089 secondly my strategy is quite good i took advantage of my height and kept distance from my opponent

4078098 no no it cannot be we had the rifle whole sic time under control it was besides us he was carrying the rifle in a soft case and it may have touched a little somewhere maybe he touched a wall or something and some screw may have become loose it happens sometimes
4078099 there was some screw loose or something one screw was loose maybe there are hundreds of screws in a rifle but he bindra was reacting cleverly he made the clicks quickly to get into the centre then he shot like a machine
4078100 but i was not worried about the final he is very good at it
4078101 this is not a drama he has the medal and who cares

4078103 we have got to identify why in this instance the system failed
4078104 bellway has today set the scene for what is likely to prove a highly bleak half year results season for the uk housebuilders over coming weeks
4078105 profit margins are being squeezed via a potent combination of increased sales incentives and costs relating to emergency restructuring issues for many housebuilders this has included significant job cuts
4078106 it is close to getting to where we expect it but we need more time to perfect it because a key part is software for image recognition and threat assessment which has been developed by the university of reading and kingston university and the maturity level of the software is improving as we speak
4078107 the system is designed to detect people who are stationary with weapons its designed to pick up people images and vehicle images and process them
4078108 were going out to search for a certain type of target if we know what were looking for we can probably find it
4078109 were trying to help our armed forces who are doing a very dangerous job do that job more effectively
4078110 i dont think the things were seeing now are ready to go for operational use clearly we would need to do a bit more work to get them rugged
4078111 we now have an adversary that is very determined very imaginative so its critical that our armed forces can be one step ahead of them we need to be innovative creative agile and thats really what this is all about achieving that
4078112 faculty crunch is a real problem and all the iits are worried about it we will soon go on a global hunt to get fresh young quality teachers
4078113 in the next four five years we will need some 3 000 more professors we will go to international institutes across the world to fill this gap
4078114 there are around 50 000 people involved in higher research in top engineering and technology institutes of the world and we just need 3 000 young talented minds
4078115 we will go by quality as iits are known for it there will be no compromise on that
4078116 its a matter of fact that there is a shortage of quality teachers but while looking for global talent we will not sideline the quality teachers in india
4078117 while doing so the key point to be kept in mind is that the iits brand equity should not be diluted
4078118 n o bala que se faz campo bom para todos quem se negar a apertar a m o deste candidato vai levar tiro
4078119 we know this is just the tip of the iceberg as a lot of women are too afraid to make a complaint

4078123 this increasing demand for design is shaped by a profound shift in how the first world makes its living creativity in its various forms has become the no 1 engine of economic growth the creative class in the words of university of toronto professor richard florida now comprises 38 million members or more than 30 of the american workforce mckinsey amp co authors lowell bryan and claudia joyce put the figure only slightly below at 25 they cite creative professionals in financial services health care high tech pharmaceuticals and media and entertainment who act as agents of change producers of intangible assets and creators of new value for their companies
4078124 microsoft ceo steve ballmer is famous for a crazy video in which he yells
4078125 yet if design is such a powerful tool why arent more practitioners working in corporations if economic value increasingly derives from such intangibles as knowledge inspiration and creativity why dont we hear the language of design echoing down the corridors unfortunately most business managers are deaf dumb and blind when it comes to the creative process they learned their chops by rote through a bounded tradition of spreadsheet based theory as one mba joked in his world the language of design is a sound only dogs can hear

4078156 the newspaper quoted zulfan adi who described himself as one of obamas closest childhood friends
4078157 but barry was a muslim i remember him wearing a sarong
4078158 nterviews with dozens of former classmates teachers neighbors and friends show that obama was not a regular practicing muslim when he was in indonesia
4078159 he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug use extended into his law school days or beyond
4078160 barack obama admitted using drugs in his autobiography but never revealed if or when he stopped

4078164 found the house for obama salon com reported that donna schwan of metro pro realty the real estate agent who listed the property recalled the deal starting when rezko expressed interest in the listing
4078165 asked who approached her about the house schwan told salon i honestly dont remember
4078166 in an interview with the staff of the chicago sun times barack obama asserted that it was his wife who found the house from the transcript of obamas interview which included a prepared statement by obama before he took questions
4078167 i saw this house i really like it its more than we originally budgeted for id like you to take a look at it
4078168 in his prepared statement obama told the sun times that michelle fell in love with the house
4078169 the boston globe also reported real estate agent schwans recollection that the obamas may not have made the highest bid but that the willingness of the obamas and rita rezko to close in june was decisive
4078170 the couple who sold barack obama his chicago home said the illinois senators 1 65 million bid was the best offer and they didnt cut their asking price because a campaign donor bought their adjacent land according to e mails between obamas presidential campaign and the seller
4078171 the transcript of the question and answer session clearly shows the tribune staff had a hard time believing obama yet obama persisted denying he coordinated the purchase with rezko page 168
4078172 offered a lengthy and to us plausible explanation for the presence of now indicted businessman tony rezko in his personal and political lives
4078173 newsmaxs ronald kessler reported that obama had been in trinity united church of christ on july 22 2007 when kessler was present
4078174 blamed the white arrogance of americas caucasian majority for the worlds suffering especially the oppression of blacks
4078175 on july 22nd 2007 he davis sat next to barack obama as barack obama heard some of these same statements from that very preacher wright and was nodding along
4078176 t he obama campaign promptly posted a new denial claiming obama did not attend church services in chicago on july 22
4078177 we worked with him specifically on his strategy the republicans were in control of the illinois senate at the time they loved to hold votes on partial birth and born alive they put these bills out all the time because they wanted to pigeonhole democrats
4078178 he came to me and said my members are being attacked
4078179 a present vote was hard to pigeonhole which is exactly what obama wanted
4078180 was give cover to moderate democrats who wanted to vote with us but were afraid to do so
4078181 a present vote would protect them your senator voted present most of the electorate is not going to know what that means
4078182 pointed to the result of most democratic plans to increase corporate taxes the government ends up collecting less capital gains tax revenue not more

4078184 obama will undoubtedly campaign in the general election saying he wants to maintain a strong military just as he will say he is fully committed to the survival of israel obamas problem is that neither position may be credible in the face of video clips that show him saying he wants to reduce the military cut nuclear weapons and pull out of iraq
4078185 increase our ground forces by 65 000 soldiers and 27 000 marines
4078186 expand to meet military needs on the ground a major stress on our troops comes from insufficient ground forces barack obama supports plans to increase the size of the army by 65 000 troops and the marines by 27 000 troops increasing our end strength will help units retrain and re equip properly between deployments and decrease the strain on military families

4078188 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
4078189 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u
4078190 the principal challenge therefore is how to ensure that the capabilities gained and counterinsurgency lessons learned from iraq and afghanistan as well as the lessons re learned from other places where we have engaged in irregular warfare over the last two decades are institutionalized within the defense establishment

4078223 quite naturally the problem of ethnic cleansings there does exist and weve been quite resolute in raising the issue and will continue raising it in the future to expose the people responsible for them
4078224 however some of our partners ask us in private conversations for some reason to refrain from raising it
4078225 international law qualifies such problems as a crime like the slaughter of thousands of people and it is called genocide
4078226 more than that weve said in the past were surprised to see the situations where one individual who killed thousands of people is described as a terrorist and a moron while another such individual is treated as a legitimately elected president of a sovereign country
4078227 let us note a few things about this incident officer molnar was not on duty he was not in uniform he did not show identification that he was a cop he was not in new york city where is a cop what would you do if a strange belligerent man and two of his friends ordered you to lie on the ground as i see it they ought to be glad dr compeas wasnt armed otherwise hed have every justification to shoot them with a reasonable fear of his life the two accomplices in this attack were not police officers anywhere but private citizens even if molnar was in the right and he clearly wasnt there is no justification in attacking the man and dragging him to a deserted beach area that implies they intended a far more serious assault molnar was not allowing the law to work he was subverting it
4078228 i do not understand why children who want to work should be denied the opportunity whether its a child prodigy on the guitar or an average kid whos willing to stuff envelopes and do other work so easy a child can do it for if a child can do the simpler tasks and wants to do them isnt it a drag on productivity to prevent the child from doing the work and require an adult who is capable of doing more advanced work to do it instead
4078229 we finished the year in line with the expectations that we outlined last quarter our international business grew 9 2 or 4 2 in constant currency rates this year our north america fragrance business declined 1 5 largely due to the decline in the u s department store business while our mass retail business was flat year on year reflecting the difficult consumer environment
4078230 as we look to fiscal 2009 we expect the liz claiborne transaction to provide us with significant incremental sales and earnings growth particularly in our north america fragrance business the integration of the liz claiborne fragrance business is currently on track we have strengthened our sales organization with minimal incremental headcount additions to our sales force and all of the key marketing personnel associated with the liz claiborne fragrances already have joined us in our new york city offices lastly we are scheduled to exit the liz claiborne distribution facility as originally planned by the end of august 2008
4078231 we also are on track with the re engineering of our extended supply chain logistics and transaction processing systems and continue to anticipate savings of approximately 10 0 million to 12 0 million by the end of fiscal 2009 and an additional approximately 13 0 million to 15 0 million by the end of fiscal 2010 we expect these savings and the contribution from the liz claiborne fragrances to drive strong growth in sales and earnings for fiscal 2009 our outlook reflects the integration of the liz claiborne fragrances and the execution of a number of new launches including fall introductions of a new juicy couture fragrance viva la juicy our first fragrance under our rocawear license and new fragrances from mariah carey and usher as well as a spring launch of a new elizabeth arden fragrance

4078233 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4078234 our obsession with looking right is far more dominant than the value we place on intellect and that is severely affecting the way many of us feel about ourselves as we have shown
4078235 in china as in many other asian cultures it seems less value is put on physical attributes like sporting prowess and more on other attributes like intellectual ability and the person as a whole
4078236 they also revere their older people whereas our culture is youth focused and very tied up with judging by appearance first and foremost i think thats where we are going wrong

4078240 competition for rolling chip business in macau during the second quarter became a lot more aggressive with higher commission rates and a significant expansion in the facilities being offered by concessionaires to junket operators
4078241 the sequential decrease in quarterly 2008 financial performance at crown macau is mostly attributable to the hold rate of 2
4078242 we remain firm in our view that macaus future as the gaming capital of asia is assured this market is still in its infancy stage of development and one of the characteristics of a nascent market is rapid fire change in this dynamic environment we will continue to develop innovative strategies to aggressively defend crown macaus position as the market leader in the rolling chip segment

4078257 ill start with the bad news beginning today twitter is no longer delivering outbound sms over our uk number if you enjoy receiving updates from twitter via 44 762 480 1423 we are recommending that you explore some suggested alternatives
4078258 twitter will be introducing several new local sms numbers in countries throughout europe in the coming weeks and months these new numbers will make twittering more accessible for you if youve been using sms to send long distance updates from outside the uk
4078259 mobile operators in most of the world charge users to send updates when you send one message to twitter and we send it to ten followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill
4078260 when we launched our free sms service to the world we set the clock ticking as the service grew in popularity so too would the price our challenge during this window of time was to establish relationships with mobile operators around the world such that our sms services could become sustainable from a cost perspective
4078261 we achieved this goal in canada india and the united states
4078262 we can provide full incoming and outgoing sms service without passing along operator fees in these countries
4078263 we took a risk hoping to bring more nations onboard and more mobile operators around to our way of thinking but weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach

4078276 people are looking forward to an extraordinary sporting weekend but i dont think they are thinking that this is a make or break
4078277 what is important are big british moments i dont think people really sit there wondering where we finished on the medals table what they remember is kelly holmes steve redgrave matt pinsent chris hoy or nicole cooke
4078278 people are excited about it already and they know that they we have a very good start we had a gold and a silver in the pool we are going back a long way when you remember a day like that in the pool and a gold medal in road cycling
4078279 people at home know that we are witnessing a step change and i hope it continues right the way through
4078280 im not going to minimise the importance of our track and field count we got out of jail in athens in track and field because of one moment that was more luck than judgement and one huge moment with kelly holmes that i had thought could happen
4078281 take the 4x100m relay and kelly holmes out of the mix and it wasnt a great track and field championships we hardly got a single male individual through to a final in athens
4078282 we coming from a low level here and i dont think we are going to get a great medal haul here
4078283 i never went to an opening ceremony when i was running i was confronted with seven races in nine days and thought that standing around for six or seven hours and being bussed halfway around the city was not something conducive with the previous 10 years preparation

4078290 each of these statutes provides for judicial enforcement of its provisions with substantial civil penalties for its infringement
4078291 fair use of a copyrighted audio video work doesnt apply when introduced in a commercial or industrial film
4078292 isnt that more a matter of custom lack of desire to fight in court against large corporate entities rather than law
4078293 as mentioned several times the two biggest factors in defeating fair use avoidance of infringement are commercial use rather than non profit and profiting from the infringement
4078294 i think their defense will be fair use for purposes of comment and criticism or perhaps parody
4078295 one thing i know i never want to piss off peter irons esq attorney at law
4078296 i think their defense will be fair use for purposes of comment and criticism
4078297 in the inner workings of a cell yada yada yada happens wed like to show you what that would look like but apparently big science is so afraid of blah blah blah that their lawyers threatened us
4078298 so what is it that makes these lawyers think that everything they get put into a book should be followed why is my choice to violate copyright so scary that these lawyerists have to threaten me with consequences if i do consequences ill remind you that they made up too no freedom to break laws is possible in a system that dogmatically makes you follow them or else you know hitler created laws too
4078299 we disagree with that and this is why we disagree
4078300 in short hes for real alrighty and i guess you missed 68 where he was very clear about his involvement in writing this draft
4078301 now if only the record labels behind the killers got involved and threatened expelled too
4078302 i always thought one of the tests for educational fair use specifically was that you couldnt charge for seeing it is that true
4078303 in honor of prof irons heres an oldie but a goodie go get em and thank you
4078304 i think he meant it along the lines of the expression
4078305 do you assume pz is such pz knew the letter was from peter
4078306 the typos in the letter are because this is an early draft that was sent to a number of us ncse has the corrected version
4078307 am i my brothers keeper i cant possibly keep track of what all 40 fellows are doing all the time
4078308 we love those who hate our enemies and if we didnt have any enemies there would be few people whom we would love
4078309 and scote heres the words youre searching for repeat after me
4078310 scote i am sure pedlar will apologize for the misspelling of your handle if you apologize for saying that peter irons sounded like a porn star name 153 kind of a cheap shot and uncalled for posted by mezzobuff april 10 2008 1 24 pm
4078311 these are the voluntary ignorance and science evil folks expelled could splice in some nascar pro wrestling beer chugging babes on a spring break beach or a cartoon of scientists torturing puppies and it would work better
4078312 do not meddle in the affairs of bards for your name is silly and scans to greensleeves
4078313 it was a nice touch on the producers part to use the same music as the xvivo video presumably they got permission from the artist or is that another possible oversight to explore but then again one of the producers was for years in the music business so most likely theyre covered here as well
4078314 and in another ucd posting davescot opines that xvivo does not have standing since harvard holds the copyright to inner life
4078315 scote per 222 you are absolutely right i did mistake you for the other poster sorry
4078316 but if you hear familiar music in a show it doesnt ncessarily mean that the artist endorsed the show or even knows that it exists yet
4078317 is the borrower making money at the expense of the creator
4078318 he has undertaken some legal work in issues of the separation of church and state and written some articles for the montana law review

4078320 unless you agree to add a disclaimer to the beginning of the film stating unequivocally that the movie contains fictional propaganda asserting that scientific alternatives to evolution theory are suppressed within the scientific community the reality is that only theories not supportable with scientific evidence are rejected further it is fictional propaganda that scientists and or educators are shunned for challenging evolution theory the reality is they are shunned for trying to wedge religious versions of creation myths into science classrooms in order to add credibility to their own religious convictions
4078321 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalize united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films
4078322 i went to visit emmelines new owner and all the time i was there i could not help thinking that it would be splendid to bring her home
4078323 i said to him that if he ever wanted to sell the car would he please call me first
4078324 to my surprise he was not averse to the idea and we casually discussed the value of the vehicle
4078325 i was delighted to have tracked her down it will be a year or so before i manage to make her roadworthy again shes going to need some tlc
4078326 john bought me a morris minor for my birthday a few years ago and we joined the morris owners club

4078328 its the time i would love to be able to come and if liverpool was next to london id do it like a shot
4078329 but its a long way and the last time i went on a virgin train it wasnt on time
4078330 but no matter what you show me in liverpool it doesnt change the bottom line
4078331 unfortunately people in liverpool are more likely to be unemployed earning less
4078332 and i think its a real shame a real tragedy for the people of liverpool

4078348 im a little bit tired and i have a full day to recover
4078349 i cant believe it after the relay i could have sunk but i told myself that after all these years of hard work i cant let myself go down my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
4078350 to bounce back from that relay takes a lot of guts and he showed that today
4078351 full credit to him he swam a better race and the better man won on the day
4078352 the most important thing is being able to separate the two events and just move on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me in the psychological part
4078353 its a new generation and its now time to step aside they did a great job im from the previous generation
4078354 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue

4078356 well where youre taking this stuff is up four flights of stairs
4078357 i think were going to struggle to get your sofa up here

4078363 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
4078364 i did tell eric on the phone the day before i came up i said hey i want to play as soon as possible
4078365 i wouldve played three plays the other night at cleveland but that wouldve been ugly i dont know i think well just play it by ear

4078380 we tested many different machines and the film master was the fastest and the most efficient for our hd projects we also wanted some restoration tools integration in the same system and we were confident in the digital vision technology and support
4078381 all this and the open platform shared storage and a flexible upgrade strategy made us choose the film master
4078382 france 3 joins other european broadcasters in putting their high end productions through a digital vision film master and like many of our other clients have chosen the system due to its speed quality of pictures generated and integration with tapeless systems including the avid product range

4078484 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4078485 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4078486 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4078489 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4078490 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4078491 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4078492 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4078493 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4078494 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4078495 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4078506 thats very evident in places like san francisco which never got rid of its streetcar system
4078507 it looks like its going to take you somewhere but its only designed to support downtown residents
4078508 if officials fall for the hype and dont ask the hard questions voters should vote them out
4078509 one happy consequence will be that streetcar customers who live in the area will be less mobile by choice

4078518 there is no doubt about the fiscal impact on government finances and on the deficit
4078519 the government will have to resort to extra borrowing or undertake stake sales in state run companies otherwise it is very difficult to bridge the gap

4078532 i want 250 000 articles in every language that has at least one million native speakers i think there are 351 languages that have one million speakers so that sort of sets a context for it in the thai language for example thai wikipedia is still fairly small with 60 000 articles i think so obviously participation is lower there

4078550 do a critics personal morals or ethical code have any place in a review and conversely humans being the way they are how can one possibly pretend they dont
4078551 there are those who would argue that a moral thesis in a review says more about the critic than it does the object of the review i am not so sure the fear in taking such things into consideration is that all of this smells of a kind of censorship how are artists to push the envelope how are they to truly examine and push the boundaries if critics have moral defences up but if nobody is watching the watchmen what can art become
4078552 i believe in the freedom of the artist to express his or her vision
4078553 but the critic and the paying customer have an equal right to register their dissent
4078554 critics should not be afraid to speak out if they find something offensive or deposit their own moral values in the cloakroom nor should they be cowed by unfortunate examples in the past such as sarah kanes blasted where everyone signally misjudged the authors intentions the alternative to a sharp tongue as eric bentley once pointed out is a mealy mouth and i see no contradiction between assailing an authors attitude and wholeheartedly rejoicing in the termination of censorship 40 years ago freedom is indivisible
4078555 how after almost all the sacred cows have been skewered flayed and burned can anything be shocking or subversive
4078556 negative shock i get up onstage and take a shit on a flag or bite the head off of a live kitten and positive shock the kind that makes you really think about it and its implications after negative shock value is relatively easy to create but has a shallow effect and leaves the audience pissed rather than provoked

4078625 there isnt an event like the olympics in terms of offering viewer choice and we know from previous games that nothing drives red button usage the way the olympics does in 2004 the first interactive olympics we did we had more than 10 million people go interactive just on the satellite platform thats more than double the next most popular event the bbcs ever done wimbledon with about four million more than anything we can do whether its glastonbury or another sports event the olympics gets people looking on interactive tv
4078626 these games are slightly antisocial happening when most people in the country are either in bed or in work the opportunities for people to just sit in front of the telly all day waiting for the action arent as obvious as athens when it was a european timezone they need to get a fix of the action wherever they are that means we need to offer them a really strong on demand service and make sure we make the live action available wherever they are
4078627 the ioc are among the most stringent in sports rights when it comes to digital platforms and we have a very strict arrangement with them that our content must not leak outside the uk
4078628 thats really for the ioc thats their role to monitor and see what happens were just not in a position to control how people use tv coverage and put it up online
4078629 when it comes to sport the real appeal is with the bbc sport website
4078630 every broadcaster has a strategy for dealing with something like this we are not a commercial organisation nbc are that may be why theyve chosen to hold back some of their content from the web for us its all about universal access we want universal reach were not about making money we just want more and more people to access the games in however many ways they want to there arent any limitations for us im sure they have very different considerations
4078631 weve had discussions with all the mobile operators it hasnt been possible to work with all of them on it largely for technical reasons

4078635 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4078636 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4078637 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4078638 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4078639 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4078640 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4078641 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4078642 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do

4078645 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4078646 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4078647 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4078648 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4078649 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4078650 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4078651 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4078652 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4078653 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4078654 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4078655 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds

4078679 sign up to push pm to ask leading breast cancer charities why they dont acknowledge environmental and occupational risk factors our campaign co ordinator helen lynn has organised a petition on the downing street website the reason for this petition is that the government and leading cancer charities almost exclusively focus on lifestyle factors improving early detection and treatment for breast cancer which has not stopped the rising incidence of the disease in this country lifestyle changes cannot prevent a woman getting breast cancer whilst cancer causing agents and endocrine disruptors are allowed to build up in the environment and our bodies we need an inclusive strategy on breast cancer which encompasses environmental and occupational exposures as well as early detection and treatment one that at its heart supports the precautionary principle with a view to decreasing or where possible eliminating exposure to chemicals and substances already found to be linked to this disease our petition question is based on the fact that the major breast cancer charities do not highlight environmental links as a risk factor in breast cancer when they act as advisors to the government acknowledgment of this link by the government leading cancer charities and the medical establishment is vital to push us to the forefront of eradicating this largely preventable disease

4078926 remember me the way i was and love me the way i am
4078927 heroes villains and velodromes inside track cycling with chris hoy
4078928 what chris and i were doing in the early 90s was classic british alpinism
4078929 he was just another one off success leave no ropes leave no trail there was no system so there was no legacy
4078930 i saw then the challenge was to convert those highly motivated highly talented individuals into a system
4078931 actually one of my biggest hurdles at first was dealing with this inflow of cash
4078932 first generation performance directors like me were suddenly expected to write business plans it was all very new
4078933 we had some good results but we couldnt really argue there was a system in place or that we had developed a culture
4078934 in fact it wasnt until late 2001 that the penny dropped i needed to clear out riders and coaches who werent obsessed with winning
4078935 it was a very hard thing to do and a lot of people found the process incredibly emotional it was our year zero
4078936 we managed to go beyond the individual and generate a critical mass of people pulling in the same direction thats what you need there can be no silos
4078937 the cyclists were a very diverse bunch but the wins and failures were shared its what gets you through the dark days
4078938 yes the funding was a huge help but it takes more than money success isnt a right you have to strive for it
4078939 im not willing to say until im on the ground
4078940 we are not going to help people who have said they will use violence we are here to save the whale not put the lives of whalers at risk
4078941 the iwc and all its members ardently condemn sea shepherds acts of terrorism
4078942 one of the rubber dinghies was attacked directly by a
4078943 we are not going to help people who have said they will use violence we are here to save the whale not put the lives of whalers at risk
4078944 one of the rubber dinghies was attacked directly by a
4078945 apparently had no intention to commit malicious crimes such as robbery
4078946 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4078947 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4078948 os dados de julho do desmatamento da amaz nia s o muito positivos n s estamos conseguindo reduzir o desmatamento

4078952 advertising in florida whether you are online or off can be a cutthroat business and that is why you need to make sure that when you are doing florida search engine marketing that you need to get it right
4078953 fooling around with alternating current is just a waste of time nobody will use it ever
4078954 a man has been arrested in new york for attempting to extort funds from ignorant and superstitious people by exhibiting a device which he says will convey the human voice any distance over metallic wires so that it will be heard by the listener at the other end he calls this instrument a telephone well informed people know that it is impossible to transmit the human voice over wires
4078955 its a great invention but who would want to use it anyway
4078956 this telephone has too many shortcomings to be considered as a means of communication the device is of inherently no value to us
4078957 dear mr president the canal system of this country is being threatened by a new form of transportation known as railroads as you may well know mr president railroad carriages are pulled at the enormous speed of 15 miles per hour by engines which in addition to endangering life and limb of passengers roar and snort their way through the countryside setting fire to crops scaring the livestock and frightening women and children the almighty certainly never intended that people should travel at such breakneck speed
4078958 everybody knows that those in bad health and those who seldom play
4078959 we had but two alternatives one was to go on to the
4078960 estamos m s cerca de hacer posible un manto de invisibilidad al haber demostrado que con ese nuevo material se puede doblegar la luz a nuestra voluntad
4078961 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
4078962 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
4078963 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
4078964 were more expensive but thats because our cost structure is higher
4078965 sono nato alle soglie dellinverno in montagna e la neve ha accompagnato la mia vita
4078966 there are now well over 5 000 people diagnosed with hiv in the north west although the downturn in new diagnoses is encouraging there could be up to 2 500 more still undiagnosed and unwittingly passing the virus on
4078967 if there will be tree climbing people of oceania will defenitely win
4078968 a historic and courageous step toward empowering women for an expanded range of choices and saving babies lives
4078969 by supporting mothers whose will and conscience tells them to carry their babies to term
4078970 broken through the narrow traditional barrier that only focused on a womens right to choose abortion
4078971 they now support in writing and in legislation a womans right to choose life by offering her practical help in options ranging from prenatal care to healthy adoption
4078972 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
4078973 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4078974 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4078975 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
4078976 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
4078977 shore up the employment based system not tear it down lower premiums that firms face through investments in information technology and prevention create a setting where individuals and small firms can buy insurance the way that large firms do make sure that insurers cannot exclude firms because one employee is sick
4078978 simply aims to bring equity and choice to our health care system including allowing american families to keep their current coverage
4078979 the mccain plan gives american families a 5 000 refundable tax credit 2 500 for individuals to give them more choices to purchase portable coverage that would stay with them from job to job or job to home his plan directly and comprehensively addresses the single biggest threat
4078980 deepened in recent years as the number of uninsured has climbed and out of pocket costs for those still with insurance have soared
4078981 the commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
4078982 would achieve universal coverage and excoriated sen hillary rodham clinton d n y for her proposal to mandate
4078983 unconscionable failure of our government to honor its commitments to our military veterans
4078984 called for a sweeping overhaul of the department of veterans affairs benefits claims program
4078985 proposes one solution item that obama has not yet mentioned
4078986 veteran with an injury or illness incurred during military service could use to get free treatment at a local hospital if the va hospital is too far away
4078987 there is one idea i have urged that mccain nor obama have not
4078988 lets rename the va the department of veterans advocacy and let the new va take the lead in providing each veteran with the benefits and care they have earned
4078989 need to start addressing the issue of long term care
4078990 of vital importance for people with disabilities and our families and friends
4078991 federal long term care policy still heavily favors institutionalization countless people with disabilities are forced to give up their freedom in exchange for assistance
4078992 obama nor mccain lists long term care as an issue on their main web pages
4078993 obama does have a nine page platform addressing disability issues
4078994 support of a major piece of proposed legislation that would make it much easier for people to receive medicaid funded assistance in their homes
4078995 say the principle reason is that they are seldom sick
4078996 when it comes to latinos what may appear to be the well known effects of socioeconomic inequality on health care may also be conditioned by unique social cultural and economic circumstances
4078997 thats the real gap i think were facing the ability to provide a medical home for a spectrum of this population
4078998 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
4078999 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
4079000 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
4079001 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
4079002 we are disappointed and disagree with the courts ruling today and believe we have substantial meritorious issues to raise on appeal
4079003 we will continue to vigorously defend our position that our product does not infringe the 320 patent

4079013 hay algunos sectores del establishment que no nos van a perdonar que hayamos recuperado nuestro sistema de decisiones
4079014 son los mismos que ahora nos quieren calificar y decirnos cuales son los problemas
4079015 en pocos d as vamos a tener las cifras del crecimiento que en los ltimos 12 meses lleg al 8 5 y en los 6 ltimos a 8 1
4079016 en junio tuvimos un baj n por las cuestiones p blicas que todos conocen pero nos estamos recuperando
4079017 hay sectores a los que se les pasaron por las orejas el problema de las hipotecas en los estados unidos y ahora quieren venir a calificarnos y decirnos que estamos en riesgo
4079018 esas calificadoras a las que se les pasaron por las orejas el tema de la hipotecas en los estados unidos ahora quieren convencernos de que estamos en problemas
4079019 son sectores del establishment financiero internacional que nunca nos van a perdonar el haber negociado la deuda como lo hicimos y haber recuperado el sistema de decisi n con la cancelaci n de la deuda con el fondo monetario
4079020 son los que creen que se pueden repetir viejas f rmulas
4079021 esas viejas f rmulas han sido dejadas de lado no solo por nosotros los que tenemos responsabilidades institucionales sino por ustedes por los argentinos que han decidido otro modelo de sociedad otro pa s
4079022 lo importante es que esta decisi n no es s lo de un espacio pol tico en particular sino que debe ser de todos los argentinos de los de hoy y de los que vengan hoy nosotros llevamos la bandera de ese cambio pero atr s vienen otros argentinos que van a seguir transfiriendo este modelo de crecimiento
4079023 lo impresionante de este lugar es la fotograf a de la argentina que yo quiero
4079024 la posibilidad de darle valor agregado a nuestra producci n es la clave del modelo
4079025 este modelo de productivo de transferencia tecnol gica nos da la posibilidad de innovar aqu en nuestro pa s sin tener que viajar a buscarla en otro lado
4079026 por ejemplo este simulador de construcci n de edificios que he visto aqu es impresionante

4079029 necesidad de dotar de valor agregado a nuestros productos con innovaci n con la ciencia con la investigaci n puesta al servicio de la industria
4079030 aqu como en ninguna otra parte queda sintetizado el modelo de pa s que queremos para todos y con todos los argentinos agregar valor innovaci n y ciencia adem s de recursos humanos e inteligencia con la cabeza de los argentinos que son cabezas importantes
4079031 fueron d cadas de instrucci n gratuita d cadas de ingesta de prote nas que tambi n junto a la educaci n ayudan al desarrollo neuronal que la argentina siempre tuvo y que nunca debi perder y a veces la perdimos cuando pensamos que pod amos vivir sin producir sin trabajar
4079032 los argentinos estamos en busca de ese tiempo perdido por eso digo siempre que no debemos perder mas tiempo en la argentina
4079033 tenemos que seguir levantando el pa s que no debe vivir de rodillas un modelo que es tal vez uno de los atributos mas importantes de la nueva argentina haber recuperado nuestra autoestima y la dignidad y saber que podemos tener un pa s diferente
4079034 y pensar que hay algunos que todav a intentan desde alg n lugar calificar los riesgos
4079035 quiero compartir con ustedes trabajadoras y trabajadores del inti esta alegr a y felicitarlos por el compromiso con el pa s y con las ideas que son las que cambian a las sociedades
4079036 son la ideas las que siguen adelante y qu es al fin y al cabo la pol tica es poder transformar las ideas en resultados

4079042 war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse a man who has nothing for which he is willing to fight nothing he cares about more than his own personal safety is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself

4079044 wayne was a much loved son grandson brother and uncle who served his country with distinction and sadly paid the ultimate price
4079045 it was abundantly clear to everyone who met wayne that his strength and personality marked him out for a bright future in the army
4079046 waynes death is a huge tragedy but he was a committed soldier who understood the risks and the importance of his work as do his friends and every soldier in the regiment
4079047 this cheerful and vibrant young man will be sorely missed by his friends but even more so by his family his loss is all the more poignant for his family who were expecting him home on leave in the next few weeks
4079048 the entire regiments heartfelt condolences go out to them at this hugely difficult time

4079064 while the champions league twenty20 is a domestic tournament not affected by icc event rules we have agreed to the icc request as a gesture of goodwill
4079065 the grand success of bindra proves that if the three important things that are family support state support and zeal to achieve for the country combine together lead to sure success
4079066 we knew the venues were going to be superb and the planning was in place
4079067 beijings spectacular opening ceremony and the overall grand scale of chinas games will be a hard act to follow but coe said the british capital will be ready to put on its own memorable event
4079068 its like watching your kids wake up open the curtains and see the back garden covered in snow for the first time
4079069 to remain relevant you have to deliver a games that leaves benefits long after the games have left town
4079070 when i went to an olympic games i didnt want to confront anything on the track i hadnt confronted twenty fold in training
4079071 there are a lot fewer challenges i spoke to the president of nbc right at the beginning of the process and we decided that changing the schedule will not be the case
4079072 im less moved by where we finish in the medals table
4079073 im not willing to say until im on the ground
4079074 i have been greatly encouraged by both of them and now believe that it is time to return home and make any contribution i can to the future of my country
4079075 his absence from the country was an indictment of the government of the day i would just hope he is coming back permanently he is an enormous resource
4079076 i have no political affiliations my obligations are solely to the people of kenya particularly the poor the dispossessed and those in need
4079077 i want to see that i am praying that that has happened
4079078 sania has even promised to waive off her match fee and will charge only two million rupees as appearance money
4079079 i have yet to receive a formal invitation to play exhibition matches in pakistan but whenever an opportunity comes i would visit pakistan to play matches
4079080 i know pakistan tennis followers love my game and want to see me in action i am ready to come to pakistan to play exhibition matches
4079081 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4079082 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4079083 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4079084 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4079085 shoot on sight orders are a clear violation of the right to life and of international standards of law enforcement
4079086 with violence escalating the troubled state of jammu and kashmir is again at the brink of catastrophe
4079087 to end this cycle of tragedy the government should order security forces to act with restraint and all parties should try to settle the dispute peacefully
4079088 i am happy and thrilled but it is tough to describe the moment in words
4079089 i had shot better in athens but today was my day it went my way that is sport
4079090 i have just been punching holes in a black paper for the last 10 years nothing else
4079091 congratulations to abhinav he has done us all proud i have always maintained that somebody or the other shines in a good team we have been improving from bronze in 1996 and 2000 to silver in 2004 we had to move forward had we gone back it would have affected the olympic sport the youngsters would have suffered now that we have one gold it will be an encore
4079092 it is only the beginning and india has got chances of winning more gold medals
4079093 we are happy that we were able to find a window during the first week of december for the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4079094 there was a gap in between the one day internationals and tests in india against the touring england squad which will enable both the rajasthan royals and the chennai super kings the ipl finalists to regroup and focus on the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4079095 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for pre christmas test match enjoyment and we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa during december and january
4079096 conveyed the new dates to the icc and they are fine with it

4079103 no podemos dejar esto en manos de la oposici n y del mercado
4079104 lo cierto dijo es que al indec este ndice nadie se lo cree
4079105 el indec tiene un nivel de desconfianza en el conjunto de la sociedad
4079106 lo que agust n plantea es describir la realidad objetiva del descreimiento que hay en el indec
4079107 no podemos dejar las cr ticas en manos de la oposici n y el mercado se al una fuente calificada porque si no cuando finalmente se decida intervenir en el indec ser a como entregar los cambios a quienes hoy est n haciendo de esto pol tica o a quienes tienen intereses creados
4079108 hoy en casi todo el oficialismo hay alg n tipo de consenso respecto a que sobre las estad sticas oficiales hay un fuerte problema de credibilidad y que hay que hacer algo para transparentarlas

4079111 en todas las cuestiones y gestiones de gobierno dijo el legislador oficialista hay cosas que cumplen un objetivo determinado en un per odo y que luego es necesario ajustarlas corregirlas hacer cosas
4079112 yo no descarto que eso sea necesario no estoy en condiciones de mencionar o de escribir con precisi n qu es lo que se va a hacer al respecto
4079113 moreno es un secretario que le est haciendo mucho da o a la presidenta y quita seriedad al gobierno
4079114 basically we are simplifying and coalescing our efforts around atom as the single brand for internet devices
4079115 the european union has this body which addresses perceived violations of the european human rights convention mr mckinnon believes his rights under that convention have been violated by the u k rulings
4079116 mr mckinnon has never been classified in that manner or treated in that manner as far as im aware
4079117 he will be treated as a normal criminal defendant in the civil court system of this country hes a run of the mill criminal with a run of the mill crime
4079118 at this point and time theres no indication the european court will give any credibility to his argument
4079119 it would be premature for him to believe that he has found a sympathetic shoulder to cry on for all the reasons he didnt prevail in the u k he shouldnt prevail there enough already mr mckinnon
4079120 singh is kinng which released last week is still going strong and would be the first choice of family audiences during the festival weekend
4079121 bachna ae haseeno is only for the young audience vis a vis god tussi great ho which is a film for the masses because of salman khans presence
4079122 there has also been no pre release tempo preceding both the films even their music has not made a mark in comparison to the music of singh is kinng that is still driving people crazy
4079123 god tussi by rumy jafry is said to be a remake of hollywood movie
4079124 god tussi will be released worldwide with around 700 prints yrf refused to divulge details regarding the prints but director siddharth anand said the movie would be released with the average print limit of the banner for a medium budget project
4079125 there is a good pre release response to all the three movies however it is true that singh is kinng is still managing high sales
4079126 singh is kinng is going strong in its second week and is expected to keep on garnering sales but we have divided our screens equally for all the three movies
4079127 we are expecting a good business with bachna ae haseeno because of the yash raj banner in comparison to god tussi great ho but singh is kinng is still getting us business of around 70 percent even on weekdays
4079128 nothing affects the ticket sales it is tough but it depends on the film if an individual has to go for a film then he or she will definitely go for it come what may
4079129 i dont fear any movie there is nobody greater than god and i have my faith in him my movie is commercial but different the audience would come to know of it when they will watch it
4079130 there are a lot of expectations from both the movies both are big projects and have big stars it would be a great holiday period and the movies are expected to do great business

4079139 soy una chica de 22 a os y me masturbo varias veces a la semana hasta ah ning n problema pero es que despu s del orgasmo tengo ganas de orinar puede ser un problema o es que a la vez que me masturbo toco alg n nervio del sistema urinario
4079140 a mi pareja le ha salido una peque a herida en el pene como una rajita peque a puede deberse a que se masturba con frecuencia y que por el roce le salga podr a ser una ets
4079141 me gustar a saber si hay alg n m todo para retardar la eyaculaci n porque luego llego muy r pido me han comentado que vaya a un sex logo y que adopte diversas t cnicas ya no es por satisfacer a mi pareja sino por m es por disfrutar yo m s de la penetraci n
4079142 existe alg n riesgo para la saludo si se empieza a usar la p ldora en vez del primer d a de regla como te recomiendan los m dicos una semana antes por ejemplo otra duda que tengo es c mo le gusta a los hombres que se les realice una felaci n
4079143 mi novia y yo tenemos problemas para realizar la penetraci n ya que le duele mucho sin embargo si la masturbo introduci ndole un dedo no hay problema ninguno de los dos ha estado con alguien antes por lo que no sabemos si es normal ella dice que se pone nerviosa as que no s si es por eso o por alguna otra cosa
4079144 soy un chico de 18 a os me masturbo con frecuencia me gustar a saber si eso puede ser malo en un futuro para las relaciones sexuales me gustar a saber si debo controlar el aguantar cada m s y c mo lo hago me gustar a tambi n saber c mo conseguir m s placer ya que a veces mi pene est seco y no lubrica y al eyacular lo hago en poca cantidad

4079146 llevo con mi pareja varios meses nuestra relaci n es buena muy buena para ella va a ser la primera vez ambos queremos y cuando estamos jugando queremos hacerlo pero a ella le da impresi n la primera vez y siente presi n cuando comenzamos la penetraci n por lo que la solemos abandonar y seguir jugando yo la noto muy tensa en ese momento qu podemos hacer para que dilate y se relaje un poco adem s de para que no le duela
4079147 cuando acabo el sexo con mi chico noto como si se me durmieran los pies y las manos es una sensaci n placentera como de hormigueo por qu sucede esto tambi n a veces en el flujo transparente hay alguna gota de sangre despu s de hacerlo y me duelen los ovarios puede ser por un pene grande o una penetraci n profunda
4079148 siempre he tenido el concepto y as lo ha sido con otras parejas que he tenido de que despu s de eyacular el pene queda un tiempo en reposo se baja la erecci n pero a mi marido esto no le pasa sino que despu s de tener relaciones su pene sigue erecto mucho tiempo casi una hora pero le duele al tocarlo es alguna disfunci n
4079149 en el acto s lo duro entre siete y diez minutos podr a ser eyaculador precoz
4079150 tengo 50 a os y mi mujer 35 ltimamente s lo mantengo la erecci n si veo a mi mujer haciendo sexo con otro chico solemos ir a pub liberales y hacemos tr os antes no eran completos pero ahora son completos y es cuando mantengo la erecci n si no es as la erecci n me dura muy poco
4079151 estoy preocupada porque mi novio fue operado de hipospadia las relaciones con l son satisfactorias pero le da bastante miedo penetrar porque piensa que a n con preservativo al tener p rdidas de orina puede salir algo y fastidiarlo me gustar a que me informaras un poquito sobre este tema y que me dijeras si las personas que est n operadas de esto pueden tener problemas para tener hijos
4079152 llevo cuatro a os con mi novio y el sexo se ha vuelto hasta casi inexistente me encanta el sexo y tengo muchos problemas con ello porque soy muy f cil de tentar es m s suelo humedecerme en cuanto menos me lo espero con tonter as que ni siquiera pensar a que me humedecer an pero el pensar en tener sexo con mi chico no me termina de agradar porque las cosas ya no son como antes y adem s es que con l apenas me lubrico puede ser problema m o el que no me humedezca en las relaciones sexuales con l tambi n quiero comentarte que llevo cuatro a os tomando la p ldora

4079160 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4079161 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4079162 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4079163 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4079164 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4079165 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4079166 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4079167 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4079168 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4079169 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4079171 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

4079178 its possible that the bank could foreclose and take it all
4079179 but erik benham has filed for personal bankruptcy to stop that from happening his major asset is the project
4079180 mr benham contends the banks exhibit is a fraud and was fraudulently recorded
4079181 determination of the nature and priority of the lien and what constitutes an asset of the estate are core proceedings and must be fully litigated before the court
4079182 the filing of this bankruptcy was in part to prevent the foreclosure of the mve property since the foreclosure risked wiping out mr benhams major asset which is the benham deed of trust
4079183 our bankruptcy has nothing to do with the real estate market or the design of the project

4079193 we wont have a bunch of water cops running around out there
4079194 only egregious violators are the ones for which we would have to come forward with a little more enforcement
4079195 were in a drought weve been in a drought for several years and we dont know how long it will last

4079211 the shifting sands of the sand dunes were a big problem one day we came to work and the sand had blown all the way up to the door knob we had to shovel the sand out to get into the blockhouse
4079212 we all thought we were doing research work when in fact we were putting reconnaissance satellites up and that the discoverer program was just a cover story

4079246 the experts classify the painting of clovis junior as belonging to the school of na ve painters perhaps because in his work the artist looks for the simplicity of the day to day of a world without sophistication in which beauty inhabits the simplest things
4079247 children birds domestic and wild animals trees and fruits pastimes and popular myths men and women of the people constitute the universe through which the art of clovis junior passes definitively integrated with the simplicity of the beautiful and the natural

4079313 it hasnt been easy but overall it shows that with good planning good people and the right attitude success can be achieved in a different discipline
4079314 if we approach things in a certain way it optimises peoples chances of success so far its just reconfirmed that what we do on the track can be done in other areas maybe its given me even greater conviction to think that were only scratching the surface you can point at these results and say this is what we can do

4079335 efforts to help the parties think creatively of ways to overcome long standing obstacles on ancestral domain and to initiate dialogue among disparate moro ethnic groups made usip a valuable contributor to the peace talks
4079336 as with past agreements a serious risk exists that the national legislature could scuttle any agreement signed by the government in the implementation phase the supreme court might also declare unconstitutional any deal on ancestral domain that grants moro significant political authority and control over natural resources
4079337 she could rouse a wave of opposition that might endanger her presidency

4079350 yes she is shes no joke look you see this beard you know i was clean shaven before i got married she said she liked the way i looked when we first began courting she started attending halaqas then she took the marriage rights class after that everything changed she said she was tired of representing islam wearing full hijab while i blended in after every night of her insulting me for saying i looked western like a little boy like i hadnt gone through puberty i couldnt take it anymore she said i wasnt a true muslim until i followed the sunnah she was right clean shaven wasnt sunnah so i grew this
4079351 brother you should do things because you want to please allah you have to correct your intention
4079352 it doesnt stop she also criticized all the men who prayed with their heads uncovered she told me it was not sunnah to go with my head uncovered so now akhi i cannot leave the house without a kufi turban or kefiyya on my head i have tried looking for a job but the only place i can get a job is stocking cans in the local halal store
4079353 wow brother your wife is extreme how are you holding up financially i mean do you need some help
4079354 this has been a calamity financially though things are going fine she has begun working from the home her business is soaring but now that i bring so little in she says that i have relinquished many of my rights akhi i have no rights in my own home now she says it is her home since she pays the rent she is demanding her mahr i have no money left you know her family made me sign 10 000 for the marriage contract she has made me pay back money for nursing our children four kids times two years nursing each one of them times 365 days of the year times 4 hours a day times thirty dollars an hour you do the math that was all of my savings now my little bit of money goes for paying for a maid she says she has no obligation to clean up she tells me that she can go to the imam and divorce me just because she doesnt like me i mean come on man how i am supposed to feel like a man like a human being under these circumstances
4079355 brother may allah make it easy on you i have seen sisters use islam to oppress their husbands can you keep a secret
4079356 brother sometimes i dont feel like a man either my wife man my wife oh this is so bad astaghfurfullah i know were not supposed to talk about what goes on with our spouses but this is hard you see when we do it she makes me keep going she says that according to islamic law i do not have permission to finish until she is satisfied you see how hard i work im tired sometimes and she never is she then says i am a sorry husband for not fulfilling my duties she sometimes says she can leave me that she has a case according to this book she read on marriage law
4079357 ya akhi that is hard i didnt know you were going through it
4079358 thats why i come to the masjid after maghrib and hang out long past isha i have to get reflect meditate get some rest before i head home and have to deal with her demands
4079359 brother dont get me started this stuff goes deep dont get me started about my mother whew paradise lies at her feet sometimes but wallahi she makes me carry her on my back no kidding really like in the park sometimes and even in the mall
4079360 ya akhi i dont know who has it worse you or i
4079361 brother we both do but our reputations would be ruined if wed commit the most hated thing by allah by divorcing our wives i believe we will be rewarded in the next life is we just bear it
4079362 unfairly presumed that small business owners are able to provide paid sick leave and dont want to

4079366 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4079367 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4079368 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4079369 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4079370 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4079371 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4079372 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4079373 xx line has been stopped out of the personal accident
4079374 oo line has been stopped out of the personal accident
4079375 we have been under siege for the last two years
4079376 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4079377 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
4079378 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4079379 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen

4079382 at this point the neocons would enter the debate in fact some like robert kagan already have by invoking the wests appeasement of hitlers annexation of the sudetenland in 1938 a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing is how neville chamberlain famously and catastrophically brushed away the aggression a few counterquestions for those who rise to compare every nasty leader to hitler and every act of aggression to the onset of world war iii do you really believe that russias move against georgia is not an assertion of control over the near abroad as the russians call their border regions but rather the first step of a campaign to restore the warsaw pact in eastern europe and from there bring back the cold wars continental standoff if so if this really is the start of a new war of civilizations why arent you devoting every waking hour to pressing for the revival of military conscription for a war surtax to triple the military budget and heres a twist for getting out of iraq in order to send a few divisions right away to fight in the larger battle if not what exactly are you proposing

4079386 the reaction of the american left to john edwardss sex scandal is nothing short of flabbergasting since when is sex outside of marriage a disqualifier for merely speaking at a political convention since when is having sexual relations with that woman in your office anything wrong since when do we judge the difference here seems to be that elizabeth edwards has cancer so only fatal disease makes the bonds of marriage sacred although the last thing i want to look to be doing is making excuses for adultery what he did was wrong the john edwards incident begs americans to look in the mirror if we think what john edwards did with rielle hunter is wrong why do we think its wrong

4079391 it takes her about 24 hours to tune out of her special work environment and then shes like everybody else
4079392 the first year she struggled on a very moderate mountain in the two thumb range
4079393 last year i took her on the hochstetter dome a 2822 metre snow peak at the head of the tasman glacier and this year i took her on a couple of very nice trips on the fox neve she climbed kilimanjaro last year i wouldnt be surprised if one day she comes and wants to climb cook but i dont like pushing people she is very realistic and she will decide
4079394 its a big mountain and every time i climb it i am still impressed
4079395 he thinks that too often people fly into plateau hut and so are not sufficiently acclimatised and ready for the challenge ahead
4079396 with the girls i flew in to the grand plateau and walked out but i have walked in many times it gets tougher every year with the glaciers shrinking and the moraines getting ugly i usually go up the freshfield glacier on skis with good snow cover you just zigzag up quite fast
4079397 climbing a mountain is like life in general when you make a decision you must put up with the outcome good or bad i would say that if you are able to pull off a climb on a mountain you will see personal difficulties from a distant perspective fewer and fewer pursuits in life are as creative as personally challenging and as satisfying as being in the mountains
4079398 the great thing with mountaineering is that there are no traffic cops no traffic lights is it a law that you must have a helmet when you go climbing no nothing is law you make your own rules
4079399 right from the start it was argued very sensibly that the first hut in the park the old ball hut built in 1891 was a private one owned by the mount cook tourist company our hut has an emergency shelter which is always open to the public and all our toilet waste is flown out

4079404 can an airplane on a conveyor belt running in opposite motion to the airplanes tires at the same speed keep the plane from taking off
4079405 a plane is standing on runway that can move some sort of band conveyer the plane moves in one direction while the conveyer moves in the opposite direction this conveyer has a control system that tracks the plane speed and tunes the speed of the conveyer to be exactly the same but in opposite direction can the plane take off

4079432 im sorry boss did your memo specify who was supposed to move the cups
4079433 then what was the point of the paper cup memo
4079434 it was not a paper cup memo it was a water cooler memo outlining the proper placement of the paper cups
4079435 that is quite impressive third memo youve issued this week isnt it
4079436 for asking about that new water cooler memo you wrote i was concerned about the proper placement of the paper cups
4079437 i couldnt find any direction from you about where the paper cups were to be placed
4079438 i couldnt find them boss perhaps she deleted it on accident

4079448 whites fear discrimination by public services some 29 per cent of people surveyed think public sector workers discriminate against them in favour of other ethnic groups and many believe they have been passed over for promotion or a job because of the colour of their skin and the study reveals that ethnic groups living in the uk feel stronger ties to the country than native whites researchers found that whites also felt less able than other ethnic groups to influence decisions affecting the country or their local area and many believe racial prejudice is on the rise in stark contrast with other races
4079449 against the russian majority in south ossetia russia says that some 2 000 civilians were killed and 100 000 displaced there are only 70 000 inhabitants in south ossetia condoleezza rice the us secretary of state urged mr lavrov in a telephone call to desist from using the two expressions in relation to georgias actions the russian minister said president medvedev also used the terms on tuesday with mr sarkozy
4079450 on the russian side foreign minister mr lavrov said that this changed nothing about the essence of the accords whatever the wording the reality of the russian dominated provinces had now changed
4079451 the state has survived the openness boom in fairly robust health the idea that globalisation meant the end of government was either undue pessimism or wishful thinking depending on your politics if government is making a comeback so is global governance

4079474 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4079475 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4079476 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4079477 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4079478 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4079479 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4079480 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4079491 she went out friday night but she never ventures far from the back garden she is always in calling distance so she can quickly come back in
4079492 but this time she had to drag herself in and you could tell there was something wrong with her leg which she then folded inwards as if she was in a lot of pain
4079493 we thought she might have been in a fight but she is a real coward she would normally run a mile if another cat came towards her she started making some awful noises and there was lot of dry blood i was hysterical when i found out she had been shot

4079498 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4079499 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4079555 with the introduction of leap as well as the introduction of a disposable element to our new matrix rf for which fda approval is pending management has taken another step towards the goal of achieving diversification of our revenues one of the key strategic initiatives we started last year synerons evolving technologies will allow us to diversify our business model in which alongside equipment sales we will begin to benefit from a regular annuity element in our revenues

4079557 we recognize it has been a long process but our future method of shipment is completely different and requires substantial review planning and high level approval we believe we are on the home stretch and every effort is being made to complete this in the most efficient and timely manner

4079768 i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with
4079769 for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty
4079770 you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room
4079771 oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you
4079772 she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me

4079780 bath is a big town but it seems everyone follows the same pursuits just like they do in brighton
4079781 but there is never enough money for too many expeditions
4079782 i was just saying i should like to go to brighton but visits are so expensive it is impossible to go everywhere one should like

4079794 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4079795 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4079796 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4079797 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done

4079800 these are the first tangible results of the modernization of the civil registration system
4079801 in order to ensure sustainable results it is important to provide continuous commitment to the process at all levels the interior ministry and the civil status offices are aware of the major challenge ahead in maintaining the quality and sustainability of the new system
4079802 in line with the personal data protection law adopted earlier this year the government should appoint a data protection commissioner and establish a data protection authority without further delay

4079808 i am not a producer so i definitely know nothing about singing and songs
4079809 i believe that playback lip synching is something that is used in the music industry and the entertainment and show industry on a regular basis but frankly speaking this is rather insignificant in relation to the complexity of the games and the magnitude of the games
4079810 has confirmed that this weekend it will start selling the high end blackberry bold the first of its kind to offer hsdpa high speed data access while retailer the carphone warehouse also expects to have the devices in store as early as 16 august

4079814 i feel better about this week than i have maybe since the first week when we came out just our approach and guys working hard and guys being out there and fighting through the adversity and pain and all that stuff its been really good that way
4079815 the main reason for signing the long term deal was due to the success ive enjoyed since ive been at the club
4079816 ive fulfilled a dream by winning a premiership and gone on to play representative football with new south wales
4079817 im not sure i could have achieved that anywhere else
4079818 we consider this video though it names no one to be a photographic list of an anti semitic nature and therefore liable to criminal prosecution
4079819 i cant believe weve such great away support and i feel sorry for them
4079820 we need to put a performance on for them and show confidence passion strength and will to score
4079821 it becomes a habit to miss chances but were out on the training field and well continue to work on it
4079822 losing to mk dons will give us a kick up the butt and weve got to use that as a positive to go forward

4079826 we had always talked during the triple crown trail about wanting to end the season in the right way and thats in the breeders cup classic
4079827 big browns camps recent remarks about curlin inspired me to offer an incentive to get these two great horses to race at the legendary track at the spa
4079828 both horses are eligible for this race and both have plenty of time to prepare for what would be thoroughbred racing at its very best
4079829 physically hes fine he just had to get down on his belly and run
4079830 thats a race that spilled the tank and weve got to give our horse the best shot to regroup
4079831 were just not looking to empty the tank in the woodward were looking to empty the tank in the classic
4079832 at the beginning of this year my wife told me she wired money overseas left from previous campaigns
4079833 was characterized by decreasing household final consumption expenditure and smaller fixed capital formation
4079834 clearly the growth dip in spring could have been worse
4079835 for the second half of this year we believe in moderate and clearly below potential growth but not in an outright recession
4079836 the financial market turbulence the rise in oil prices and the decline of the u s dollar are now showing effects on germany

4079841 somebodys got to be north americas team right it might as well be us
4079842 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4079843 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a paedophile
4079844 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4079845 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4079846 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet

4079874 during the time that iphone was launched we sold more blackberrys because what happened people suddenly start looking at technology and suddenly understand that it is for them too i think weve moved well beyond this idea that high tech belongs in the boardroom belongs to a certain class of individual only because now that technology is now being adopted by people from all walks of life and its not all about work
4079875 i think what happened was the amount of marketing and the attention they apple generated in the market the customers are now coming to the store and saying i didnt know you could do all that with a phone and when they get there they realise theres a selection theres not just one device and so what its actually done is increased our sales
4079876 those who grabbed him were police officers and the last thing we wanted was for the police to be involved

4079880 no other country has experienced such rapid racial and ethnic change
4079881 a momentum is built into this as a result of past immigration
4079882 in the 1970s 80s and 90s there were more hispanic immigrants than births this decade there are more births than immigrants almost regardless of what you assume about future immigration the country will be more hispanic and asian
4079883 whats happening now in terms of increasing diversity probably is unprecedented
4079884 within the conventional definition of race of white black asian minority versus non minority this is a big change

4079902 he just kept progressing when i saw him play the other day i said yeah thats how he played for us its a bad decision to pressure him full court hes so fast and so quick for me that really put it in perspective you think hes playing chris paul and deron williams theyll keep him in front of them but he shot layups just like he did in college
4079903 one thing people dont know about him is how great his belief is in his ability and his team to win
4079904 his style and skills havent changed much hell keep getting better because he has an awesome attitude and hes a great competitor
4079905 well just have to be smart about resting him when hes done
4079906 well be sure to give him a chance to mentally and physically recover he will not go through the same program as the rest of the guys

4079943 why are all christians such closed minded morons their attitude towards atheism is marked by perpetuating generalized misconceptions about honest seekers of truth like me often in the form of pitifully sterile insults they should celebrate those whose opinions differ from their own like we do stupid christians
4079944 completely unlike us christians never demand any more evidence for the validity of their belief than bandwagon appeals to common knowledge everybody knows this is true how could anybody even entertain conclusions drawn about an opposing point of view from such ridiculous ignorance hypocrites
4079945 and what about the bible if there is a god reason dictates that the bible should have compelling dynamic theological and ethical innovations unlikely to be conceived by human beings alone it should also offer strong circumstantial support for divine inspiration of course it does not i know this because i heard somebody quote a verse from it once
4079946 the bible has been proven many times through scholarly critical analysis to be nothing more than a biased collection of fairy tales written for the sole purpose of subjecting the superstitious masses under a code of moral liberty and civil enlightenment this conspiracy is what allows monsters like mother teresa to rule as the despicable despots they are breaking the spirits of proactive altruists everywhere
4079947 why is there any degree of disorder and injustice in the world its not like a perfectly black and white world would make the existence of god obvious thus removing our crucial need to develop faith in god and would reduce us to mindless automatons forced into conformity
4079948 the complex worldview that christianity posits suggests that humanity is an intricate tapestry of interdependence working towards a fundamentally greater collective good
4079949 by their fruits you will know them so has anyone ever abandoned a materially abundant lifestyle or altered behavior inconsistent with their beliefs because of religious conviction nobody that i know of this is because religion is only a selfish delusion of convenience not a vigorous and vital dimension of life whose empirical validity empowers adherents to make vastly positive personal change their wanton mental self indulgence is starkly revealed when placed in contrast with those of us who so stoically bear the spartan torch of atheism
4079950 i read this in the correspondence of a european philosopher and scientist to his brother in 1895 if there were in existence some supreme being why has he then withheld from his own children that most natural of blessings automated wheeled transportation for as any fool can see such a marvel absolutely be commensurate with the existence of god if not for this insurmountable flaw however i would gladly become a christian this perfectly logical query was never satisfactorily addressed and he died a happy atheist in 1948
4079951 clearly belief in god amounts to no more than wishful thinking simply put while those of us who accept atheism only do so after the most stringent open minded research into every possibility and then often reluctantly those who embrace any faith based belief system always do so blindly the more they explain their opinion the more they reveal their fundamental ignorance
