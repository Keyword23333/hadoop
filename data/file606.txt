6060049 a massive e mail and internet campaign is under way aimed at derailing the nomination of barack obama and making hillary clinton the partys standard bearer next week at the democratic national convention in denver
6060050 its really about elegant street mix and nuanced styling that flows from judy and jane jetson dresses lots of vivienne westwood references and bombastic futurist themes hence lots of metallic finishes and sheen representing speed energy and modernism that will definitely carry over into forthcoming collections

6060054 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6060055 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6060056 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6060057 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
6060058 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
6060059 its a different field if you will but its no less important
6060060 its a privilege to represent this state particularly we have a great tradition here ted kennedy and going back to john quincy adams

6060076 this shareeah is the straight and correct way anything other than this is the way of those who have earned the wrath of allaah such as the jews the christians and the polytheists
6060077 s ome muslims will deviate to the doctrines of the religion of the jews or that of the christians such deviation is made alluring by satan
6060078 islam is very sensitive about maintaining its purity and the unique identity of its followers to the voluntary recommended fast on the tenth of muharram muslims are required to add another day 9th or 11th to differentiate it from the then prevalent jewish practice muslims are forbidden to emulate the appearance of non muslims
6060079 allaah inflicted his punishment on all the people of the sabbath jews because of what they did they were changed into apes despised and rejected
6060080 since the era of the prophet until today the jews have been conspiring against the muslims and spreading dissension and despair among them so that they may not be able to defend their religion and restore their usurped lands for these reasons the muslims must come to their senses and stand united in the face of this jewish danger and its endless evil goals

6060106 ive long held that people have lost their voice call it the stuttering of the democratic process not in having a right to vote or the mechanic to do so but the real sense that a persons voice can count for something be purposeful weighty and heard amongst the din of rice crispy culture and politics i spent five years at mtv striving to have a 25 year old brand continue to earn its place as a platform for young people to have a voice in a formalised broadcast environment while youtube and the new social nooks and crannies became the new playground now i find myself in the realms of a brilliant system spinvox that can make the human voice matter again how because spinvox takes a voice literally the energy in motion of particles in the air and converts it into text data that data can then be posted as content into the digital world its a revolution for me voice is the last human faculty that has not been obfuscated or complicated by the advances of science it remains entirely naked and therefore a pure expression of your id your self if only 30 of the language processed by our system is dictionary documented then the complexities and personalities contained in the spoken language and vernacular suggest that the voice continues to be an immensely powerful tool for us all to emotional connect with each other create and find social order so what is the future of voice whats is its summit of its mountainous journey

6060144 we have warned before that we are sleepwalking into a surveillance society holding large collections of data is always risky the more data that is collected and stored the bigger the problem when the data is lost traded or stolen defeating crime and terrorism is of the utmost importance but we are not aware of any pressing need to justify the government itself holding this sort of data if there is a problem with the current arrangements we stand ready to advise on how they can be improved rather than creating an additional system to house all records

6060159 zaheer did the job for us as he bowled in right areas credit also goes to badrinath as he had not played sri lankan spinners ajantha mendis and muttiah muralitharan before
6060160 we needed this victory there was pressure on us especially after losing opener gautam gambhir stiff neck before the match we would have liked to win comfortably but in the end it is about winning
6060161 we knew we could win this match only by getting wickets we tried hard but dhoni and badrinath batted really well and their partnership took the game away from us

6060173 total fertiliser subsidy is estimated to be rs1 19 trillion in 2008 09 while we have made available rs540bn cash payment to the fertilizer industry
6060174 the finance ministry was putting ifs and buts but prime minister dr manmohan singh said there should be timely payment of subsidy as it is a matter related to farmers i thank the prime minister for his personal intervention
6060175 when i joined the subsidy was rs130bn which has now increased to rs1 19 trillion but in the last four years not a single penny burden has been imposed on farmers as there was no increase in prices of fertilizers we have reduce d the prices of complex fertilizers by up to 19

6060179 its funny they announced theyll spend 20 million reaching out to hispanic voters but when you go to florida the only spanish ads are by john mccain
6060180 at the end of the day john mccain doesnt need an introduction with the latino community he has been working for more than two decades on the values principles and issues latino voters care about
6060181 the interesting thing about these swing states in the southwest is that theyre swing and the latino vote is very strong
6060182 if ive spoken to 10 major people who were at the meeting nine of them even up until mid july were still unhappy with latino access and status within the obama campaign and his outreach
6060183 so far as i can tell he hasnt established that layer of his outreach yet
6060184 can he get by without latinos in nevada probably but he cant get by without latinos in new mexico

6060190 that it was the senator himself who was actually wrong on the facts
6060191 but the recent attacks on senator obama that allege he would allow babies born alive to die are outrageous lies the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
6060192 was not the bill that was presented at the state level

6060194 it is our companys policy not to comment on pending litigation and thus will not comment on the specifics of this case that said the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
6060195 this is a clear violation of the fundamental rights of individuals to live and practice their faith
6060196 forcing doctors to have to choose between being a doctor and being a christian in the state of california is an outrageous violation of the fundamental rights of every american to be able to practice their faith and not to have to leave their occupation because of it
6060197 this is instead about the thought police attempting to censor christian beliefs and christian perspectives that dont agree with homosexuality were talking about individuals being able to force doctors or other professionals to violate their faith in order to keep their job
6060198 for example lawyers who are engaging in marriage and family law can now be forced to execute documents for homosexuals adopting children
6060199 and individual with a wedding service despite their christian faith to the contrary can now be forced to conduct wedding services and wedding preparations for lesbian or homosexual male couples
6060200 this just goes to show how critically important it is for us in the united states to have a supreme court that is not against those who practice the christian faith but instead understands what the constitution is about and do not engage in outrageous judicial activism

6060203 no it doesnt it says certain behaviors are intrinsically evil it says the homosexual condition is intrinsically disordered welcome to the club all of us have to deal with the disorder of sin in our hearts and the evil of sin in actions what it comes down to is where you find your identity do you reduce your entire god given identity to sexuality or are you a child of god like everyone else who must struggle with sin in your life and heavy seemingly unfair and heavy crosses in this life on the road to paradise

6060302 out of the two guys nick probably has the most power which weve yet to see hes going to be a very good right handed hitter its tough to bring along good young right handed hitters but he has a chance to be a real good right handed hitter with power i dont have any problem with him playing left field against lefties i wish i could find him more at bats against right handed pitchers but hes been very good for us in the role that hes played tremendous

6060305 random house made the decision to cancel its us publication of the novel the jewel of medina after much deliberation and with great reluctance
6060306 the decision was based on advice from scholars of islam among several creditable sources that publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community and could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
6060307 this is a work that absolutely stopped at nothing in order to desecrate something that all muslims hold sacred
6060308 firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some
6060309 however we must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided not to go forward with this publication out of concerns for the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel

6060323 ive laid out your dark blue pinstripe honey when you look good you do good
6060324 this is just a motions hearing not the o j trial
6060325 youre going against ruth remember i dont want you getting light headed in the middle of an argument
6060326 ruth kranmeyer is very good but she is not clarence darrow she can
6060327 were having ruth and phyllis over for dinner tonight and for once id like to be serving a meal without crow for the entree and humble pie for dessert
6060328 its just that phyllis and i got a little bet on the outcome of todays hearing and i dont want you to lose
6060329 i understand phyllis and i are dining at your place tonight
6060330 it seems the girls got some sort of bet going on this hearing
6060331 i wanted ruth to have a full stomach when she paid the bet
6060332 but sue the judge decided in favor of ruths client
6060333 well susan this started with your remark and you lost the bet maybe you should explain
6060334 well two weeks ago phyllis and i were shopping and i was trying on this dress that i really wanted when i got ready to buy it phyllis asked if they had it in larger sizes when the salesclerk said yes phyllis asked for it in a size that i knew was meant for ruth well i tossed my dress on the counter and blurted out that i wouldnt be seen dead in a dress a drag queen was going to wear
6060335 so thats how you think of me a drag queen
6060336 well i was really sorry for what i said phyllis walked out of the store and wouldnt accept my calls for a week when she did she wouldnt accept my apology we finally agreed to have lunch last saturday to talk things out and and well it didnt work out
6060337 i told susan that youre man to kick her husbands ass in court every time you oppose each other and that youre man enough to satisfy both her me and every woman at hume goethe marlowe anytime and to prove it when you won your next court bout with scott you would get to fuck both me and her with scott watching but not joining by the way ruth is wearing the dress susan wouldnt be caught dead in
6060338 phyllis honey i am truly sorry i did not know how hurt youve been by all this if you want a divorce
6060339 if i wanted a divorce i would have filed the first time i caught you cheating i love you as you are panties and all but these false friends of ours
6060340 phyllis will have to do without her pound of flesh
6060341 well ive seen you as harlan in the buff i dont think susan ever had anyone but me have you sue
6060342 wouldnt you like to help ruth get ready to fuck your wife
6060343 does that feel like a drag queen between your legs susan you think some macho man with an eight inch dick would be concerned with your getting use to him my husband in a dress is more man than any man youll ever have in a jock strap especially this cocksucking husband of yours
6060344 you like being fucked by a drag queen susan you like having your cunt stretched so that you cant move just wait until you loosen up enough for ruth to really fuck you you might be needing the divorce lawyer when ruths through with you i dont think youll ever be satisfied with scott after tonight
6060345 in general it is not like any other utility you cant just turn it off the banks wont run without computers
6060346 it was a time of extreme free spending and following that crash so there have been several years where it departments have been subject to extreme discretion of their spending habits and had to justify every purchase they made
6060347 so i would say they are the one department that can say been there done that when it comes to careful examination of spending
6060348 people have not been overspending on it and thus it is not the juiciest place to cut right now
6060349 the idea is not to introduce new requirements but some clarifications will lead to certain changes in the way you do things

6060358 i have prepared for these olympics since 2002 and that led to my success today i had problems i learned from them and i overcame them
6060359 i eked out that last inch to dip him baala on the line that would have been absolutely devastating to come that close then just miss out
6060360 it really didnt hit me till i started the victory lap and got to the back straight and i really couldnt hold it back any more and broke down in tears
6060361 sprint away early in the mens 5000 heres a guy who truly knows what hes talking about along with his five world cross country crowns ngugi won a 5000 meter gold in seoul in 1988 by going out so fast that only one other runner even stayed in his neighborhood and that poor guy portugals domingos castro got nipped by two germans near the finish and got no medal at all ngugi believes kenyans edwin soi eliud kipchoge and thomas longosiwa should not allow the ethiopians to run with them because they are strong finishers
6060362 the 5000 is a difficult race and the fact that i am the only winner for kenya makes me proud but sad at the same time since we have not produced another winner

6060399 al qaida has tried to terrorize the population and make them cower with these attacks invoking their grip of fear on them
6060400 tragedy results in 2 types of responses it either galvanizes people or it makes them cower this attack had a galvanizing effect
6060401 the people of tarmiyah after 4 years of torture kidnappings and public slaughters just really want to live out their lives in peace
6060402 they cant tolerate terrorist activity anymore and face the risk of publicly condemning al qaida
6060403 this oath will show the media savvy al qieda operatives a crystal clear picture that there is no terrorist sanctuary in tarmiyah and the people will not bend to terrorists any longer
6060404 the significance of this event was the reaffirmation of the locals to stand up against terrorism
6060405 the mass violence in the country underscores the chilling fact that the most dangerous place in iraq is not the mosque the marketplace or the military checkpoint but the classroom
6060406 its great that the city was able to get this school opened up
6060407 the school is going to be a wonderful institution not only for the students but for all of ramadi as the youth of the city continue to earn an education they will assist the city and the province in making their country prosperous
6060408 this school will allow young people from all across al anbar to come and learn a trade it also has the added benefit of getting the young males off the streets and giving them something productive to do this school will give them opportunity to become functioning members of society

6060461 you watch michael phelps kick butt in the swimming pool you watch our mens basketball team dominate i would hope the ioc wants the olympics to be about giving everything that you possibly have and if you happen to win by a lot thats what makes the game so beautiful
6060462 i had so much emotion so much want to go out on top
6060463 if that is the reason who wants to play in a sport where winning is bad
6060464 you watch michael phelps kick butt in the swimming pool you watch our mens basketball team dominate i would hope the ioc wants the olympics to be about giving everything that you possibly have and if you happen to win by a lot thats what makes the game so beautiful
6060465 i had so much emotion so much want to go out on top
6060466 he said it was his job even after he got his orders that he was going over there he said its his job

6060470 i tried the other method and it didnt work in atlanta in 1996 we took the best team the squad stayed in the best hotels we spent 5m and we didnt win now our plan has dungas face
6060471 it would have been better if we scored but you cant achieve everything it is not like the 1960s
6060472 there will be doubts about my ability that is sport sometimes we win sometimes we lose we hoped to get a gold medal but this defeat will not affect my confidence and plans
6060473 we were given a breakdown of the tickets sold to the general public and the nocs

6060488 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
6060489 i will let no one question my love of this country
6060490 i love america so do you and so does john mccain you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
6060491 sen mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
6060492 sen mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues
6060493 i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but thats not what history shows

6060499 metta is essentially desire so it must be a case of gradually transfering all the energies we put into our other desires which arent truly good for us into metta instead of wishing we were in a different situation we can just wish ourselves well in the situation we are in that is more direct and achievable in our pursuits of happiness we often desire things which are symbols of happiness like money and status things that arent it themselves but we think will bring it metta though is more direct it is like contemplating the thing itself we orbit the notion of what happiness is and in that it becomes more real metta is unlimited it never comes to an end chasing material possessions is only fulfilled by getting them there is a limit to what we can get material desire is always blocked perhaps rich people see this the most and lose hope but with metta our desire can never diminish it can just get stronger and stronger our life can be channelled towards more and more meaningfulness we can be more and more expansive and outward looking that meaning doesnt depend on what comes back we can always be more interested in more finely tuned towards more sensitive to living beings we can just go on and on developing it leaving more and more of our old dull concerns behind often helping beings to be happier is simply about giving them our friendliness interest and attention about showing care and taking them into account so we could say metta is about transfering our desires from the mundane things and to the desire for the happiness of all beings it is difficult to desire two things at the same time in the end they will be in competition we need to choose which one to let go of so we can put our attention on the other this is effectively what the sutta says have a simple life of few desires

6060506 in papers filed yesterday the mbta acknowledged for the first time that their charlie ticket system had vulnerabilities and estimated that it would take five months to fix
6060507 tuesdays ruling lifts the restriction preventing the student researchers from talking about their findings regarding the security vulnerabilities of bostons charlie card and charlie ticket a project that earned them an a from renowned computer scientist and mit professor dr ron rivest
6060508 the students have already voluntarily provided a 30 page security analysis to the mbta and have offered to meet with the mbta and walk the transit agency through the security vulnerability and the students suggestions for improvement
6060509 i dont know about that last one it might have been the alcohol talking
6060510 it was important to win and level the series before leaving for colombo
6060511 had we lost this we would have gone to colombo with immense pressure on us but now we can afford to relax fully before regrouping for the next game
6060512 there was great pressure on us after we lost gautam gambhir to injury in the morning it left us without a specialist opener
6060513 but zaheer did the job for us he hit the right areas and drew the batsmen forward forced them to play on the front foot and got those edges
6060514 that performance was backed by some good fielding and the other bowlers
6060515 we would have liked to win by a bigger margin but then its all about winning the game
6060516 we didnt want to put more pressure on anyone so we did away with the team meeting in the morning
6060517 there is no point discussing a thousand things and making strategies we left it to the individual players to prepare mentally for the game in their own way
6060518 promoting myself worked but the credit ought to go to badrinath
6060519 hes playing his first one day international and he was facing ajantha mendis and muttiah muralitharan for the first time
6060520 its good to see a youngster like him taking responsibility and batting the way he did
6060521 we had talked about it for a bit and we though 175 200 would have been a good score on this wicket
6060522 we expected the ball to do a bit in the first 45 minutes and we knew we had to survive the new ball but we lost four early wickets and that didnt help our cause too much
6060523 i think the boys showed great character to reach the total we got and the bowlers did a tremendous job
6060524 we were in it right to the end which was great
6060525 it was the dhoni badrinath partnership which took the game away from us

6060529 the ioc took the measures with the olympic games we could also do similar things and take sanctions with regard to the world championships
6060530 the ioc was very clear in the lead up we would work in concert with all the anti doping bodies
6060531 we feel the deterrent effect plays a part in what we see here the athletes know the ioc means business

6060551 i find our politicians approaches to young people as they are called as if they are a separate breed from humanity rather contradictory young people like to congregate on street corners it doesnt mean they are doing any harm some get up to mischief but most of the more serious crimes are perpetuated by not so young people the curfew experiment was carried out in hamilton a town in the county of lanarkshire the latest plan to control young people is to prevent them from buying alcohol if they are under 21 the problem that i have with this is that people under 21 carte blanche are being considered irresponsible in their consumption of alcohol while those over 21 carte blanche are considered responsible this idea is occurring at the same time as it is considered ok to send teenagers in the military to iraq or afghanistan they are responsible enough to be entrusted with that while there is also a wish by the present governing party in scotland to reduce the voting age from 18 to 16 so as to include and engage young adults in the political process young people are our nations future the responsible citizens and decision makers for tomorrow but i think that today you would be hard pushed to convince them of that

6060553 the defendant assured plaintiff that the glass would be installed in a good and workmanlike manner so that it would meet all marine surveys and consistent with the standards in the industry
6060554 after the glass was installed and paid for plaintiff discovered that the installation work was defective and the glass now has to be replaced

6060677 we are happy to be a part of this celebration of young people and nature
6060678 montgomery countys parks offer a variety of opportunities to get outdoors and enjoy
6060679 our park naturalists are leading the charge in keeping young people connected with nature
6060680 taking their programs out of the nature centers for instance and offering them on the ground and directly in communities across montgomery county
6060681 our naturalists have also been taking their programs to community centers boys and girls clubs neighboring schools county recreation centers libraries and a host of other venues to spread their passion for the natural world with others in creative and fun ways
6060682 we also want to encourage all parents and guardians to find time for unstructured free play in the many open and wooded park areas near their homes

6060692 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6060693 were real remorseful they said they never had any intentions of harming anybody
6060694 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in the watchmen and enjoin the release of the warner brothers film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property
6060695 it is a terrorist act when you sow fear in communities and the milfs attacks are actually sowing fear in many villages and nearby cities
6060696 that is the situation there now people are afraid that violence would erupt once again or might spread to other nearby areas
6060697 the milf central committee must surrender their men to the government to show good faith and sincerity to the peace process
6060698 command responsibility applies to both the armed forces of the philippines afp and milf
6060699 there maybe still some gray areas when it comes to exacting accountability to non state forces for their atrocities and criminal acts but it doesnt mean that they are excluded from respecting human rights
6060700 its very treacherous it does not bespeak of a group that wants peace we have to be very firm in enforcing the law
6060701 the prime duty of the government is to restore law and order in war torn provinces in mindanao the minority bloc condemn undeniably the violence inflicted on the civilian population in north cotabato lanao del norte and other places in mindanao
6060702 the attacks on civilians by milf groups are immoral un islamic and un christian
6060703 at this point im telling you based on my experience this is just the beginning this will escalate
6060704 are no longer in pursuit of rebellion not a political crime but an ordinary crime
6060705 with these highly condemnable acts they should face the full force of the law
6060706 with the full budget backing of congress our troops will go after the perpetrators of these dastardly acts headstrong and punitive actions will be undertaken
6060707 congress deplores in the highest sense these atrocities committed by the milf the attacks are systematic organized well planned and well orchestrated definitely not the works of renegades as the milf leaders claim
6060708 what the milf rebels did assaulting villages hacking civilians to death and burning houses are not the actuations of a group that is for peace
6060709 prove that they too are ashamed of their terrorism or are weak as an organization for not being able to control their men or both
6060710 whether the people they are negotiating with are in full control of the forces they allegedly represent
6060711 the way it appears some milf factions do not follow the cue and just go on a rampage on their own so we may be talking peace but they may have other agenda
6060712 a respite from the fighting although temporary relief is what the people need at this time to allow the leaders and their followers from both sides to gather their wits and join hands for long lasting peace
6060713 its important that we continue with the peace process but it should be with accountability
6060714 if we stop with the peace process it will only aggravate the situation whoever is responsible for the atrocities they should be held accountable and whoever is in the way of the peace process must be held accountable
6060715 i am about ready to be on an island we are going back into the smallville mythology a little bit and kind of explore how oliver became the green arrow why he is the green arrow and how he became so good at archery and all that stuff
6060716 i wish i would have had a bit more notice but well see what we can do by tomorrow at five oclock in the morning
6060717 but i think once you do that just like in everything once you question something and your hearts not in it it becomes really dangerous to keep doing it because you are vulnerable youre susceptible just like you hear these football players say if your not playing 100 you are going to get hurt so theres that and as he starts to kind of question whether or not its worth it anymore
6060718 clark is starting to embrace his destiny a little bit more so you see that happening
6060719 its interesting because the guy thats worn the suit is going the other way and the guy who has never put the suit on is going the other way so we start to butt heads a little bit so its going to be fun
6060720 i had just shot a pilot with cassidy freeman who plays tess mercer on smallville she ruined it
6060721 they didnt pick it up and i think it was a day or two later when i got the call and we talked a lot about it i love playing the character its a great show and a lot of fun for me so when they said series regular i was definitely interested im excited about it
6060722 i got a lot of faith in them in the writers
6060723 they always write good stuff for me i am just lucky because i get to be the face that benefits theyre the ones that do it though
6060724 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity
6060725 youve got manuscripts that are relatively short and then youve got manuscripts that are taller than they are wide and then youve got ones that are taller than they are long
6060726 i was thinking shorter but once youve done all the work to build the project and get the reader into it theres the temptation to keep it going
6060727 post this at all the intersections dear friends lead with your ears follow up with your tongue and let anger straggle along in the rear gods righteousness doesnt grow from human anger so throw all spoiled virtue and cancerous evil in the garbage in simple humility let our gardener god landscape you with the word making a salvation garden of your life

6060734 carnival has a great track record and we are excited about helping this first class operation become even more successful
6060735 gee i didnt know you were that stupid to fall for this shit i thought you were smarter than that
6060736 i have long hair and was wearing a heavy metal t shirt and i feel that may have had something to do with the attack
6060737 it made me think of the murder of sophie lancaster in lancashire and i organised charity gig in ipswich back in april that raised around 450
6060738 im looking to organise another one to raise more money
6060739 i was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and it upset me but things happen you just dont expect them to happen to you
6060740 im not going to let people like that drag me down
6060741 you come to hear of so many stories about asthma cases now but it seems people are still not taking asthma seriously

6060744 ravis work embodies the synthesis of fields and types of multidisciplinary research that will be necessary if chemical engineering is to make major contributions to the fields of nanotechnology and biotechnology
6060745 i cannot think of a more deserving candidate for this award
6060746 ravi is clearly at the very top of the group of dynamic young people in our profession
6060747 interfacing bioactive molecules with nanomaterials or nanoscale scaffolds is a promising approach for designing potent therapeutics and functional nanocomposites
6060748 new advances are coming faster than ever its an exciting time to be conducting research in this area
6060749 we are extremely grateful to hhmi for this generous contribution
6060750 the speed at which hhmi responded to our request for help speaks volumes to the institutes commitment to sustaining and fostering biomedical research across the nation
6060751 the carver college of medicine is home to four hhmi investigators kevin campbell ph d val sheffield m d ph d edwin stone m d ph d and michael welsh m d whose research contributes directly to hhmis mission of advancing biomedical research in the united states

6060755 the rensselaer it program requires more computer science knowledge than many other it programs at other universities
6060756 because the program was designed with this technology and science component our graduates are able to do as well as talk about it
6060757 we are constantly making sure that the program evolves with the marketplace
6060758 when a new field like financial engineering emerges we will create new concentrations
6060759 it is truly an amazing time to be graduating with this degree
6060760 for outstanding contributions to the cga the governmental affairs profession and the higher education community over a lengthy career largely dedicated to university governmental relations
6060761 this award is national recognition of dereks leadership in building strong ties with our federal constituency and advocating for issues of utmost concern to higher education
6060762 it is interesting that evolution leads to a mechanism that protects against bacterial infections by modulating their virulence without killing the bacteria
6060763 this approach may have important implications in the development of new therapies against bacterial infections that are not antibiotics
6060764 for some time now studies have suggested a possible link between paraoxonase function and cardiovascular disease
6060765 interestingly some researchers have proposed that bacterial infection and inflammation contribute to the pathogenesis of heart disease our results from this study might link these two ideas
6060766 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
6060767 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
6060768 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
6060769 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
6060770 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions
6060771 will be conclusive proof of my infirmity or mental incapacity

6060784 well shit who the fuck would wanna be in a category anyway
6060785 i used to look rugged and old until i got into boxing and they beat me into a baby face
6060786 margarito would be easy work if bob shows me the money ill fight anybody anywhere if it makes dollars it makes sense
6060787 margarito is levels below me ill punish him for being on the level he is ill punish him for disrespecting my team
6060788 bob arum is the greatest promoter in history i love bob arum i love hbo
6060789 my team calls all the shots out of the ring i call them in the ring
6060790 maybe i can fight margarito next if i pick his name out of the hat
6060791 who has margarito beaten to deserve a shot at me once he beat two or three big names then well fight
6060792 me and margarito were not fighting to prove to the boxing fans who the best is
6060793 but you got to realize this im an a level im an a level opponent oscar de la hoyas an a level floyd mayweathers an a level i mean margarito is a he got d level fighters he had bob arum he got d level fighters you know without be honest without floyd mayweather or oscar de la hoya i mean what is top rank honestly
6060794 i mean the fight with henry bruseles somebody had to give him a chance you know everybody gives i mean how will we ever know how good a person is till you give them a chance somebody had to give him that chance so i gave him that chance
6060795 who is margarito he dont bring shit to the table
6060796 like i said before i grabbed boxing fans and asked who is this guy margarito and they didnt even know who he was
6060797 like i said before i beat margaritos ass any day of the week if this is the fight the fans want to see so be it margarito dont dictate what i do dont no one know who margarito is

6060800 you know me im running my mouth a lot and im looking for a guy to shut me up if you dont shut me up im going to keep running my mouth nobody can beat me there is no way to beat me

6060802 i want to beat the best out there and whoever is considered the top fighters of my era
6060803 i dont really want to talk about this guy margarito because i see things that bob arum does that dont make any sense he says im the best fighter in the business im the best fighter since muhammad ali but then hes talking about me ducking and dodging a fighter he kicks me out of his boxing gym then he wants me to fight his fighter margarito how can you talk about doing future business with me if youre conducting yourself with disorderly conduct
6060804 its a smart business decision to not fight you now but we will down the road
6060805 im not in the game for just the money im in the game to be a legend and give the fans and media all around the world exciting fights
6060806 to the media after defeating carlos baldomir in nov i love the sport one more fight and im through i dont need boxing im not in it for the money its about legacy im rich and ive accomplished what i want
6060807 they talk about floyd mayweather duckin and dodgin opponents listen im trying to fight the number one guy if the number one guy cant fight then im fightin the number two guy if i cant fight number two im fighting number three
6060808 i dont know who paul williams is but i hear hes a pretty good young fighter
6060809 margarito has four losses why should we fight a guy with four losses
6060810 i for sure want to do that thats what i am going to college to do did you see her mom
6060811 this is bullshit you didnt get to where you are now thinking this way you were convinced it would happen you were willing to work hard and do what needed to be done until you achieved your goal no matter how long it took
6060812 just do it work on these things youll get there
6060813 we have seen the funny side of this but i have told archie he cannot do it again

6060852 the per barrel cost of jatropha oil is significantly lower than the current cost of crude oil uses a fraction of the resources and is considerably cheaper to produce than soybean rapeseed or corn oil the primary crops presently used for the production of biofuels due to our expertise in plant and soil sciences and our continued development of jatropha plantations we believe mdi is uniquely qualified to satisfy doe requirements and to become the first united states based producer of commercial quantities of jatropha oil

6060862 there are problems to be resolved but this is the time were starting to talk to them
6060863 akan muncul setelahku para pemimpin yang tidak mengambil petunjuk dari petunjukku amp tidak mengikuti sunnahku dan akan tegak diantara mereka orang2 yg hatinya adalah hati syaitan dalam jasad manusia
6060864 apa yg akan aku lakukan wahai rasulullah jika aku menemukan yang demikian
6060865 engkau mendengar amp taat kepada pemimpin walaupun dia memukul punggungmu amp mengambil hartamu maka dengar dan taatlah
6060866 salaf adalah orang orang yang mendahuluimu dari nenek moyangmu dan kerabatmu
6060867 artinya bertaqwalah kepada alloh dan bersabarlah maka sesungguhnya sebaik baik salaf pendahulu bagimu adalah aku
6060868 salafush shalih adalah generasi pertama yang mendalam keilmuan mereka yang mengikuti jalan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam yang selalu menjaga sunnah nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam alloh pilih mereka sebagai sahabat nabinya dan alloh tugaskan mereka untuk menegakkan agamanya
6060869 artinya janganlah kalian termasuk orang orang yang mempersekutukan alloh yaitu orang orang yang memecah belah agama mereka dan mereka menjadi beberapa golongan tiap tiap golongan merasa bangga dengan apa yang ada pada golongan mereka
6060870 tidak dan aku juga tidak berada di atas millah utsman aku berada di atas millah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
6060871 tidak diperbolehkan bagi seorangpun untuk mengambil suatu perjanjian atas seseorang agar dia selalu menyetujui apa yang dia selalu menyetujui apa yang dia kehendaki memberikan loyalitas kepada siapa saja yang disukai oleh yang dia baiat memusuhi siapa saja yang memusuhi orang yang dia baiat bahkan orang yang berbaut seperti ini adalah seperti model jengkhis khan yang menjadikan siapa saja yang cocok dengan mereka adalah teman yang loyal dan siapa saja yang menyelisihinya adalah musuh yang harus dibenci
6060872 sesungguhnya tangan alloh diatas jamaah maka tidak ada pengelompokan dan hizbiyah dalam islam maka aku meminta perlindungan alloh kepadamu agar engkau tidak luluh sehingga menjadi rampasan kelompok kelompok madzhab madzhab yang batil dan partai partai yang ghuluw yang menjadikan wala dan bara di atas hizbiyah tersebut maka jadilah engkau seorang penuntut ilmu yang berjalan di atas jalan yang lurus mengiuti atsar dan sunnah menyeru kepada alloh di atas bashirah dan mengakui keutamaan orang orang yang terdahul dan bahwasanya hizbiyah yang memiliki jalur dan lingkup yang baru yang tidak pernah dikenal oleh salaf maka semua itu adalah termasu penghalang yang terbesar dari mendapatkan ilmu dan dia memecah belah jamaah
6060873 di antara syiar ahlus sunnah adalah ittiba mereka kepada salafush shalih dan meninggalkan segala sesuatu yang bidah dan diada adakan
6060874 adalah abu ahmad termasuk orang orang shalih yang teguh di atas sunnah salaf
6060875 beliau mengikuti manhaj salaf dalam ittiba kepada sunnah pasrah kepadanya dan tidak berkubang dalam ilmu kalam
6060876 artinya siapakah yang lebih baik perkataannya daripada orang yang menyeru kepada allah mengerjakan amal yang shalih dan berkata
6060877 tidak ada cela bagi orang yang menampakkan madzhab salaf menisbahkan diri kepadanya dan membanggakannya bahkan wajib diterima semua itu darinya dengan kesepakatan ulama karena sesungguhnya madzhab salaf adalah haq jika dia sesuai dengan salaf secara lahir dan batin maka dia seperti seorang mukmin yang di atas kebenaran secara lahir dan batin
6060878 dia tidak pernah masuk sama sekali dalam ilmu kalan dan jadal bahkan dia adalah seorang salafi
6060879 as silafi diambil dari kata as salafi yaitui yang berjalan di atas manhaj salaf
6060880 kami walhamdulillah selalu ittiba dan tidak melakukan kebidahan kami mengikuti kitab dan sunnah dan salafush shalih di atas manhaj ahlus sunnah wal jamaah
6060881 dakwah syaikh muhammad bin abdul wahhab bukanlah madzhab kelima sebagaimana banyak dikatakan oleh orang orang jahil dan para pemfitnah sesungguhnya dia adalah dakwah kepada aqidah salafiyah dan memperbaharui yang hilang dari islam dan tauhid
6060882 kami berwasiat kepadamu agar masuk ke universitas islam madinah karena dia adalah universitas salafiyah yang mengajarkan kepada para mahasiswanya aqidah ahlus sunnah wal jamaah
6060883 salafiyah adalah nisbah kepada salaf dan salaf adalah para sahabat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan para imam yang di atas petunjuk dari tiga generasi terdahulu yang dipersaksikan dengan kebaikan oleh rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dalam sabdanya
6060884 artinya sebaik baik manusia adalah generasiku kemudian yang datang sesudah mereka kemudian yang datang sesudah mereka kemudian datang kaum yang persaksian seorang dari mereka mendahului sumpahnya dan sumpahnya mendahului persaksiannya
6060885 ada orang yang mengaku berilmu mengingkari nisbah salafiyah dengan menyangka bahwa penisbahan ini tidak ada landasannya sehingga dia mengatakan
6060886 tidak boleh seorang muslim mengatakan saya mengikuti salafush shalih dalam jalan mereka dalam aqidah ibadah dan suluk
6060887 artinya sebaik baik manusia adalah generasiku kemudian yang datang sesudah mereka kemudian yang datang sesudah mereka
6060888 keliru jika ada orang yang mengatakan bahwa ahlus sunnah wal jamaah ada tiga salafiyyun asy ariyun dan maturidiyun ini adalah perkataan yang salah kami katakana bagaimana mereka semua dikatakan ahlus sunnah dalam keadaan mereka berbeda beda adakah sesudah kebenaran kecuali kesesatan bagaimana mereka semua dikatakan ahlus sunnah dalam keadaan mereka saling membantah satu dengan yang lainnya ini tidak mungkin kecuali jika dimungkinkan dikumpulkan sesuatu yang kontrakdiksi maka baru pernyataan ini bisa dibenarkan kalau tidak maka tidak syak lagi bahwa salah satu dari tiga kelompok ini adalah ahlus sunnah maka siapakah dia apakah dia adalah asyariyah ataukah maturidiyah ataukah salafiyah kami katakan barangsiapa yang menempati sunnah maka dialah ahlus sunnah dan barangsiapa yang menyelisihi sunnah maka dia bukanlah ahlus sunnah maka kami katakan salaf adalah ahlus sunnah wal jamaah tidak berlaku sifat ini kepada selain mereka selamanya dan suatu kata diperhatikan dari segi maknanya agar kita melihat bagaimana kita namakan orang yang menyelisihi sunnah dengan ahlus sunnah ini jelas tidak mungkin bagaimana mungkin kita katakan tiga kelompok yang berselisih bersatu dalam satu pemahaman ini jelas tidak mungkin maka ahlus sunnah wal jamaah adalah yang meyakini aqidah salaf sampai orang yang datang belakangan di hari kiamat jika dia berada di atas jalan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan para sahabatnya maka dia adalah salaf
6060889 bagaimana dikatakan bahwa bermadzhab dengan salafiyah adalah bidah sedangkan bidah adalah kesesatan dan bagaimana dikatakan bidah ittiba kepada salaf sedangkan ittiba kepada salaf adalah wajib berdasarkan kitab dan sunnah serta haq dan petunjuk alloh subhnahahu wa taala berfirman
6060890 artinya orang orang yang terdahulu lagi yang pertama tama masuk islam di antara orang orang muhajirin dan anshar dan orang orang yang mengikuti mereka dengan baik alloh ridha kepada mereka
6060891 artinya wajib atas kalian berpegang teguh dengan sunnahku dan sunnah khulafaur rasyidin yang mendapat petunjuk sepeninggalku
6060892 artinya sebaik baik manusia adalah generasiku kemudian yang datang sesudah mereka kemudian yang datang sesudah mereka
6060893 mereka adalah yang berada di atas jalan yang aku tempuh hari ini dan para sahabatku
6060894 apakah salafiyah adalah suatu hizb kelompok dan apakah menisbahkan diri kepadnya adalah hal yang tercela
6060895 salafiyah adalah firqatun najiyah kelompok yang selamat mereka adalah ahlus sunnah wal jamaah bukan suatu hizb yang dinamakan sekarang sebagai kelompok kelompok atau partai partai sesungguhnya dia adalah suatu jamaah jamaah yang berjalan di atas sunnah maka salafiyah adalah jamaah yang berjalan di atas madzhab salaf dan di atas jalan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan para sahabatnya dan dia bukanlah salah satu kelompok dari kelompok kelompok yang muncul sekarang ini karena dia adalah jamaah yang terdahulu dari zaman rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan terus berlanjut terus menerus di atas kebenaran dan nampak hingga hari kiamat sebagaimana diberitakan oleh rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
6060896 salafiyah telah menjadi istilah yang dikenal yang ditujukan kepada jalan generasi yang pertama dan orang orang yang meneladani mereka di dalam pengambilan ilmu cara memahaminya dan metode dakwah kepadanya
6060897 artinya tidak henti hentinya sekelompok dari umatku yang mendapat pertolongan dari allah tidak ada yang bisa membahayakan mereka siapapun yang menelantarkan mereka hingga tegaknya kiamat diriwayatkan oleh ahmad dalam musnadnya 5 34 tirmidzi dalam sunnahnya 4 485 ibnu majah dalam sunannya 1 5 dan dishahihkan oleh syaikh al albani dalam shahih sunan ibnu majah 1 6
6060898 only on my way here dolle phoned me to say this athlete tested positive the process is under way
6060899 that makes it bittersweet id have been really upset if shed won gold the penalty you should pay if you take drugs is not to compete at the olympics
6060900 the ioc took the measures with the olympic games we could also do similar things and take sanctions with regard to the world championships
6060901 the ioc was very clear in the lead up we would work in concert with all the anti doping bodies
6060902 we feel the deterrent effect plays a part in what we see here the athletes know the ioc means business
6060903 by every supply and demand standard the oil market is nowhere as tight as it was in 2004 when oil was fetching about 50 a barrel yet prices are nearly double now
6060904 im really happy but also a little sad about our result
6060905 we were determined to fight but were limited by our capabilities
6060906 i was thinking that we can do something more but not everything has to do with practice and games
6060907 i think we need more experience need more players in other clubs other countries
6060908 at this minute its not completely resolved we want him to stay i think thats obvious

6060910 were all really excited about it and its really good for the sport in the u s were one of the under reported sports id say and to have two teams performing this well hopefully will draw a younger crowd to become future olympians
6060911 you can always talk about it and say the words but until up here in the mind you really truly believe them its not going to happen
6060912 the first thing i said when i came back to this team was i want to get us back to the podium weve kind of put that thought in their minds all along get back to the podium we havent been there in 20 years
6060913 that might have been true for the outside world but honestly for us were not surprised
6060914 were definitely happy with where we are and thrilled to be here but we know we have two more games to go

6060918 we were only able to get a spot in the top eight with the level were at now but at least we have closed the gap to the top
6060919 thats thanks to all the matches weve played against european teams and to our own progress in recent years
6060920 the result is regrettable put a lot of pressure on us to make bad shots we didnt perform as well as we can lithuania played extremely well
6060921 four years ago we made it to the top eight but the process was really difficult and full of pain
6060922 when we got eighth it felt like a cake had fallen from the heavens
6060923 this time the result is a bit disappointing the process was full of passion we improved our training and raised our basketball competence my olympic journey has been full of joy
6060924 weve gained a lot of experience we had persistence motivation and a lot of passion its rare in my 10 years on the team that we played so many successive high level matches
6060925 four years ago i thought 2008 would not be far away but i had three major operations over that time i hope that wont happen again

6060943 coming from a person occupying the responsible post of a minister in a state the remark is deplorable and should be condemned by all the remark should be withdrawn immediately and the minister should tender an unqualified apology to the people of bihar

6060956 reduced cdo cushions are becoming more commonplace with the dual pressures of reduced liquidity and increased delinquencies

6061226 standard registry cleaners were created to repair errors in the registry but clearing out faulty entries does not completely fix the problem and it does not restore the registry to like new efficiency
6061227 even after cleaning the registry may still be over inflated and fragmented and pc performance is still negatively impacted
6061228 the internet has given birth to powerful tools that many businesses would benefit from but most companies cant implement because of security and privacy issues taskwises productivity software fills this gap with a secure solution that can be implemented in house and that is completely scalable

6061230 the role of security information and event management in security governance risk management and compliance
6061231 organizations of all sizes are compelled to demonstrate compliance with industry and government regulations industry standards and best practices or internal policies related to information security
6061232 these policies as the explicit expression of an organizations business objectives and their view of the optimal balance between protection compliance and profit provide the foundation for the most effective security governance risk management and compliance programs although their capabilities are still developing there is clear evidence that companies with top performance are taking proactive steps to ensure that investments in security and compliance controls directly support the strategic objectives for the business
6061233 by effectively allocating it resources based on business objectives and acceptable levels of risk organizations improve security sustain compliance improve leverage from existing it resources make faster decisions and optimize business processes
6061234 many organizations are leveraging siem solutions to track analyze and manage how the requirements expressed by their policies are being satisfied then they utilize siem results to drive appropriate actions and behavior by the relevant stakeholders users of siem solutions are achieving superior results in security grc as siem provides an active continuous self adjusting link between policy and behavior

6061236 its too late you are fucked we are fucked now
6061237 i have always been a fan of using real instruments
6061238 i hate that we have become so dependent on computers so i pride myself in using real and analogue instruments for that true bigger sound
6061239 techno to me should sound as if it came from tomorrow
6061240 techno music has always been about taking something from the present and manipulating it to make it sound as if its from the future
6061241 its about grabbing bits and pieces from tracks today and making something new
6061242 as a dj i think its my job to create experiences worth remembering
6061243 its like your first kiss or the first time your child walks the first time may not always be the best but youre never going to forget it
6061244 i have a low attention span certainly and i hope i get bored quicker than my audience and hopefully that keeps me one step ahead of them
6061245 i dont believe all that techno is for a d d sufferers stuff maybe people are just curious or perhaps have misplaced energy
6061246 we wanted to create a next generation performance integrating and connecting the performers on stage as well as the audience members involving each of them through the use of the interesting communication technologies
6061247 it is something we have experimented with before with the narod niki project but i believe that we are taking it down a new tangent that we didnt explore with that project
6061248 well my imagination is still bounded by what is possible
6061249 i would love to have control over an immersion styled environment where there is no separation between the crowd and the performer i hope that contakt is the beginning of that idea
6061250 in the old detroit days we actually experimented with motion and heat sensors to give people a feeling that they were connected to the whole thing so some of these ideas are not new ones for us its just that now finally the technology is catching up and giving us the possibilities to really test them out
6061251 i wish that we could make contakt a five or 10 day show so that the crowd could be much smaller each day and the environment could be more controlled
6061252 right now technology allows for real surround sound and a 360 visuals but its economically unfeasible
6061253 taking somebody out of their routine and creating something that creates a spike in their lives is the power of electronic music
6061254 when the curtains opened at sonar to reveal us five on stage the audience were like what the fuck is this
6061255 of course there was a great symbolism to them doing this at the senaki base
6061256 in their eyes senaki was a bit of nato that they just dont want to see in georgia
6061257 the buildings the arms all gone if you consider that this is one of the few such modern bases we have this was very important for us
6061258 we have already informed the us led coalition naval forces who have dispatched a warship to intercept the tanker believed to be heading towards somalian waters
6061259 this is the fourth ship being hijacked in a month in the waters
6061260 we call upon the un and the international community to take immediate steps to stop the worsening security situation in these waters
6061261 the ship has 39 crew of which 29 are malaysians and 10 filipinos
6061262 weve had a few participants come forward and wish to participate in the program weve had numerous phone calls and traffic to our web site as well
6061263 what were immigration officials smoking when they came up with that idea
6061264 heres somebody an immigrant who spent thousands of dollars going through a horrible trek through the desert and jeopardizing their own life just to get here and here they think theyre just going to go home because we said they can they didnt ask for our permission to come why would they ask for our permission to go home
6061265 was designed so we could give individuals the opportunity to comply with the law and to remain out of custody to make arrangement for themselves and their families
6061266 this is to honour and respect the memory of our president whose support for football was demonstrated through his personal love for the sport and through his governments continued support to the game
6061267 it isnt fair to compare us to the pioneers of aviation
6061268 the good news here is weve got a solution that will solve the thrust oscillation phenomenon
6061269 i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber
6061270 everyone knows i love la but london watch out im coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me
6061271 im in the uk all the time but of course i cant bring all my friends so ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond
6061272 its very likely if youre out in croydon parts of bensalem edgely and west bristol you could be exposed
6061273 the scary part is the west nile youre not going to get it if you arent getting bit and the more you are getting bit the higher your risk i dont like to think about it

6061275 business unusual encouraging women and men working together in choosing healthy lifestyles

6061277 our programmes are designed to promote long lasting changes in parental roles family structures institutional practices the organisation of work and time personal development and independence as well as provision of quality of healthcare
6061278 it is all about women becoming agents of their development and empowerment this simply means that womens empowerment is in the ability of women to exercise power in all of the social institutions that govern their daily lives their households and their extended families
6061279 the empowerment of women is critical for the improvement of life of the general population
6061280 we are the first country in africa to declare maternal deaths a notifiable event mainly because we believe no one should die just because of pregnancy and childbirth
6061281 in march this year i launched three committees one for confidential enquiries into maternal deaths one for assessment of the deaths of small babies one year and below and the third one for the assessment of death of children five years and below this is to intensify the prevention of preventable deaths amongst women and children
6061282 our work begins just as soon as our leaders sign on the dotted line
6061283 i think a lot of the it guys look at this and go look when you look at the total cost of ownership the price of the device is one piece of it
6061284 since deploying lumension securitys all in one solution suite weve seen a 365 percent reduction in cost that number is based on a drastic reduction in help desk calls longer uptime and stability of our network greater bandwidth and dramatically less computer downtime
6061285 that is why god gave you to me honey to give me hope

6061298 we realise that carols shoes are extremely difficult ones to fill as she has done such an amazing job on countdown over the past 25 years
6061299 however just as we found carol through an ad in a local paper we really hope we can do the same again and find another outstanding mathematical mastermind
6061300 we know many countdown viewers have great heads for numbers so we are looking forward to seeing how talented they really are

6061313 we found a numerically lower incidence of stroke and higher incidence of cancer in the groups receiving folic acid but these observations were not statistically significant the findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
6061314 las jornadas tienen dos objetivos una es poner en valor la obra de areu crespo y la otra es celebrar y convocar a alumnos docentes ex alumnos y a toda la comunidad a celebrar el aniversario

6061318 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
6061319 ik kan wel zeggen dat ik er nog steeds voor ga

6061321 city offers same obvious info weve been hearing for the past 3 months
6061322 indonesia is the land of people with brilliant cultures amp traditions
6061323 while these extras may offer variety and entertainment for some consumers they are also the subject of ongoing complaints
6061324 the accc is particularly concerned over what it considers is the failure of certain advertisements to adequately disclose the costs and ongoing nature of the services offered
6061325 el objetivo de esta semana es informar a la sociedad en general y a la comunidad educativa en particular acerca de los desarrollos que hay en el mbito cient fico tecnol gico y despertar en los j venes el inter s por estas nuevas tecnolog as fomentar la cultura tecnol gica en cada uno de los chicos
6061326 nuestro acercamiento a biof brica fue por el trabajo que hacen que lo ven amos siguiendo por las noticias que salen en los medios y entonces consideramos imprescindible que los chicos conozcan estas nuevas tecnolog as pero adem s que incorporen estas actividades como posibles salidas laborales
6061327 la experiencia fue altamente positiva tanto los alumnos como los docentes quedaron sorprendidos por el trabajo realizado en biof brica las explicaciones brindadas el recorrido por las instalaciones el conocer un laboratorio con estas caracter sticas nicas en la regi n y los viveros con la tecnolog a de punta que tiene

6061332 its just politics dont get so upset about it besides you still have your arms to fight that battle over the chessboard where it belongs
6061333 i appeal to all not to mix politics and sport
6061334 i would like to emphasize that mixing politics with sports is clearly against the spirit of the international chess community

6061340 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
6061341 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
6061342 as the official uk broadcaster of the games the bbc has benefitted significantly from the weekends success
6061343 the live action olympics feed which includes both text updates and video streaming via iplayer has evidently helped keep people on the bbc sport site with the average session time increasing to an all time high of 8 minutes 46 seconds
6061344 britains olympic success has led to more and more people logging on at work to watch the medals roll in
6061345 we expect new viewing figure records to be broken as the games reach their climax and great britain rounds off one of its most successful olympics ever
6061346 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6061347 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6061348 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6061349 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option
6061350 i do yoga which is great for pregnancy and im still doing headstands
6061351 my yoga teacher reckons ill be doing them right up to the day before i give birth exercise is a confidence builder i want to look and feel my best
6061352 we couldnt take the complaining anymore he always told me that he thought school was a waste of time
6061353 when i was a kid i remember they were winning all the stanley cups and every kid on the street had a habs jersey
6061354 and what i remember the most was the rocket richard book that we used to read at school
6061355 its still surreal i live here in edmonton and i havent lived in montreal in a long time and i havent really gone back there in the summer
6061356 i think its going to hit home when i get there when training camp starts and i get to wear the jersey for the first time i dont think its totally sunk in yet
6061357 the fact that i live here it would have been much easier to play here but it was a hard decision to make it was really tough
6061358 my dad lives in edmonton my mom lives in montreal my mom was begging me to come back home
6061359 i love it here if it wasnt for the fact that my mom was there i would have stayed here
6061360 living in montreal for a full year is something that i havent done for a while
6061361 the justice department has proposed a new domestic spying measure that would make it easier for state and local police to collect intelligence about americans share the sensitive data with federal agencies and retain it for at least 10 years
6061362 she gets up while it is still dark she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls
6061363 i ask basic questions what are you going to do in the shoe
6061364 we can check the wear patterns to see if that shoe is correct for you
6061365 some people want one shoe for everything and thats just not possible today
6061366 dont wear a running shoe for volleyball running is a straight forward activity volleyball is back and forth running shoes dont have any lateral support so youll roll an ankle
6061367 that helps transition as you pull your toe up and makes the transition smoother since you dont leave the ground
6061368 a true crosstrainer used to be something cut a little higher
6061369 the big thing these days is how the midsole is set up if you have an unstable midsole youre going to roll your ankle
6061370 we developed footwear in concert with sparq to support that kind of training activity and launched in march and april
6061371 that is the shoe that can stand up to different activities
6061372 there are worse things than dying jimmy had said like not really living while you are alive
6061373 if you ever have any slight discoloration please go to your dermatologist or your doctor and get it checked out as soon as possible
6061374 youll want to do it monthly less frequent ly and youll forget to do it
6061375 have a good mirror or a good friend or partner able to check your back
6061376 look for any skin blemish that is not normal for you
6061377 use your first three fingers and go in a circular motion from the nipple around it doesnt matter how you do it just be consistent
6061378 you can also do up and down and up and down then look in the mirror sometimes the nipple might retract or you could see dimpling theres one cancer inflammatory breast cancer that can show up like a rash check under armpits with the pads of your fingers for lymph checks
6061379 thats an uncomfortable thing to do those self exams youre just starting to know your body but a good place is the shower and probably monthly to make the habit pain is rarely a symptom its usually just a lump
6061380 unless we view screening in the context of prevention and diet and exercise then the screening opens a conversation when screening results are viewed in context of the big picture its more helpful
6061381 see a doctor for blood testing so youll get ideas about what to do with the results
6061382 it was tough i had to do a lot more work in the first two rounds than im used to that showed over the last 50 metres i learned a lot
6061383 im a little disappointed that i didnt set a personal best currently 20
6061384 i believe i proved throughout the 200 metres that im arguably one of the best curve runners in the world and that will bode well for our relay team
6061385 im still very fit and very motivated and thrilled to be representing my family friends province and country on the biggest sporting stage on earth
6061386 in the pit of the stomachs of most church leaders i know there is this gnawing sense that christian community has to be more natural spontaneous and life giving
6061387 we cross a line when we attempt to prescribe small groups as the answer for everyone and for every season of a persons life
6061388 it is not the primary purpose of a church to have small groups
6061389 rather i believe it is a primary responsibility of a church to help people live whole healthy lives and as a part of the whole the church could help people make healthy connections with those they encounter everyday
6061390 the development of meaningful relationships where every member carries a significant sense of belonging is central to what it means to be the church
6061391 the biggest challenge for the church at the opening of the 21 st century is to develop a solution to the discontinuity and fragmentation of the american lifestyle
6061392 so cluttered that people have a difficult time encountering the simple and powerful message of christ so cluttered that many people are busy doing church instead of being the church
6061393 a church that does a good job in discipling its members does not assume that discipleship is accomplished through a few books and programs
6061394 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6061395 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6061396 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6061397 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6061398 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6061399 it comes around at night its transparent in the light you could crush it with a finger and youll do it just to watch it die flies are feeding on someones blood isnt it kind of just like love
6061400 illuminating something asleep in me a great escape from a lonely life
6061401 we realise that carols shoes are extremely difficult ones to fill as she has done such an amazing job on countdown over the past 25 years

6061403 we know many countdown viewers have great heads for numbers so we are looking forward to seeing how talented they really are
6061404 in the past few days a few people have checked in in the fanpost and fanshot sections and around the internets to provide their own opinions on the state of the washington nationals franchise after the trade deadline the draft pick signing deadline and the 126th game of the 08 season
6061405 are the lerners serious about winning or is this another bob short type owner
6061406 the classic thing in robotics is bring this or play this chess game and win the task is given
6061407 ralf ders system is only defined by what it perceives and does but theres no goal its a very good approach
6061408 ostensibly it was a celebration of the 20th anniversary of the major events of the singing revolution but it was also a celebration of independence on the eve of the 17th anniversary of the restoration of independence as well as a show of solidarity in light of the ongoing conflict between russia and georgia

6061414 you really must do this every evening looking in the mirror as you do it making sure you get every tiny amount of plaque out otherwise you are going to lose all your teeth it will be a lot of hard work but it will be worth it in the end i will see you in three months but if you work really hard every night on that plaque if youre a very very very good boy you may only have to see me every six months by the year 2054
6061415 thank you goodbye you controlling bitch you can take my plaque but youll never get my love

6061418 it costs a lot of money for the cities to have an online library system
6061419 you get to know your clients very well with time they get the benefits of a private class and the motivation of being in a group
6061420 there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing
6061421 it gives people the occasion to get out in the winter when the light is beautiful
6061422 you also get better results in the winter because the ground is not level working your abdominals stabilizers and posture
6061423 my doctor at my last check up noticed that my heart rate was better and that i recuperated bone density without medication
6061424 i was sitting there listening to her talking about unrealized dreams and a light bulb when off in my head
6061425 she didnt expect the surprise at all and was totally blown away by it she laughed she cried it was something she thought would never happen
6061426 it was a great experience to be a part of leonora is a wonderful and vibrant woman everyone who played a part in realizing this great gift for this wonderful woman couldnt help but be touched by her story
6061427 she was so excited to finally get her diploma she took it home and hung it up on her wall and is still raving about it

6061445 our goal was to finish in the top 8 and while i am disappointed we didnt reach it it was a good experience
6061446 by the third game of the tournament we knew that we could play against the best in the world
6061447 we were expecting more they were better what can we say in the crucial moments when we had to score we didnt at the beginning they made the big gap and it was hard to get equal with them
6061448 we went into the match against italy relaxed about winning or losing thats why we lose
6061449 we were not on the level we should be for the beginning of the game
6061450 we are going for fifth place now and wishing montenegro all the best in the semifinals
6061451 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances

6061454 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
6061455 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6061456 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6061457 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6061458 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning

6061460 well have to count on several sophomores and juniors to play in a powerful conference
6061461 any tool with internet access and a rubber mask can now be a millionaire
6061462 they bought a 30 rubber mask took a picture of the mask in a freezer and sat back and watched their stats program explode now im not sure if these two are web monetization experts but with the kind of traffic they generated from their low tech hoax they were able to generate over 2 million worth of web traffic by modern internet marketing standards thats right imagine making 2 million in a few days with no initial investment
6061463 using a proper blend of cpm traffic google adsense in text publishing and even a few affiliate programs bigfoot traffic should have generated them 2
6061464 lets face it how many industries actually exists that allow someone to invest under 100 and return millions exactly none my friend
6061465 people have kids to feed and mortgages to pay someone who is desperate enough because theyre house is being foreclosed on will do anything short of robbing a bank to right their ship and its not like getting someone to look at a picture of a rubber mask is a crime now is it
6061466 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
6061467 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6061468 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
6061469 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
6061470 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
6061471 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
6061472 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions
6061473 because i could see it wasnt going anywhere if i didnt do that
6061474 i wouldnt give up because i believe in the man i really do
6061475 maybe i just feel he can put a smile back on the face of the world

6061503 our numbers have been up for the past two years we arent seeing any indication of a decline
6061504 several of those home are short term homes while we seek a more permanent place for the child depending on their needs
6061505 we are happy to have a new home in the county that can provide therapeutic care for our children
6061506 it could be because of their age a lack of a suitable home or due to their needs

6061510 the people are sneaking in here on saturday and sunday getting the job done and then leaving

6061551 the best that can be said about these ideas is that theyre pandering

6061565 its really not acceptable to the people i represent that this administration is considering allowing doctors and nurses and pharmacists that have received their education to provide services to now be able to not provide those services if they dont want to
6061566 it allows everybody whether you are a receptionist or a maintenance person to object to doing their jobs because they object to abortion or sterilization
6061567 but anyone who wants condoms birth control pills or the plan b emergency contraceptive will be turned away
6061568 critics say the stores could create dangerous obstacles for women seeking legal safe and widely used birth control methods

6061578 sommigen de communie ontvangen terwijl ze de leer van de kerk naast zich neerleggen of publiekelijk immorele levenskeuzes als abortus ondersteunen
6061579 de gelovigen in onze tijd zijn ondergedompeld in een cultuur die erop gericht is het zondebesef te doen verdwijnen een cultuur die een oppervlakkige houding bevordert die de noodzaak in staat van genade te verkeren om de communie waardig te kunnen ontvangen doet vergeten
6061580 waarom bovenal voor de redding van de persoon zelf door te voorkomen dat hij heiligschennis pleegt

6061586 as long as im here i cant see myself as a happy member of this organization at all not with this situation being what it is i dont see it being rectified either the relationship with me and the organization is done im here to uphold my contract thats it

6061589 during the 1980s you had the yuppies in the city chained to their desks and making their millions which they couldnt spend because they were working

6061591 a growing number of parents now have relationships with their children that is more like that of a brother or sister so they are increasingly influenced by their childrens tastes in fashion and music
6061592 but gravers should beware too much imitating their children can lead to a slippery slope of hedonism and down that road lies the oldest and saddest swinger in town
6061593 im putting my children through school but i dont have any other ties so ive decided to start living for myself a bit more its liberating

6061623 die bisherige saison kommt mir ganz anders vor als die vor einem jahr damals spielte konstanz eine gro e rolle diesmal erzielten die top fahrer ganz unterschiedliche ergebnisse jeder fahrer der mindestens ein rennen gewann holte mindestens zweimal keine punkte
6061624 gute ergebnisse sind deshalb umso wichtiger und bis zum ende der saison wird auch die konstanz wichtiger werden am wichtigsten wird es sein immer in die punkte zu fahren
6061625 von nun an wird jedes einzelne rennen extrem wichtig sein und jeder einzelne punkt einen gro en wert haben
6061626 diese saison zeigt wieder dass man nie aufgeben sollte ich hatte ein paar rennen in denen es nicht so gut lief aber aus irgendeinem grund war ich immer noch in der lage ein paar punkte zu sammeln wir m ssen aber konstant gute ergebnisse erzielen
6061627 nach dem letzten rennen muss ich einen punkt mehr haben als die anderen das ist mein ziel
6061628 ich freue mich immer sehr wenn eine neue rennstrecke im kalender auftaucht und auf valencia bin ich besonders gespannt
6061629 mir steht von ungarn immer noch ein l cheln im gesicht das war ein unglaubliches resultat ein fantastisches gef hl und ich hoffe es war der erste von vielen podiumspl tzen in der formel 1 f r mich

6061639 wir haben es hierbei mit einer sehr gut organisierten schmuggelmafia zu tun
6061640 das problem dabei ist dass nicht nur die arten durch derartigen handel gef hrdet werden sondern dass zudem ein enormer ansturm auf die einheimischen zoos losbricht denn in denen werden die eingeschmuggelten tiere dann betreut
6061641 sie k nnen selbst objekte mit geringem eigengeruch wahrnehmen und sind daher ideal f r die schnelle kontrolle von gep ckst cken postsendungen oder ganzen containern

6061653 this was a protracted theft so there would have been several vehicle movements around the park hall and charnock richard area

6061663 ich war wirklich so auf diese eine medaille fixiert dass ich mich erst fast nicht ber bronze freuen konnte wenn nur von gold geredet wird dreht man irgendwann selbst am rad
6061664 wir sind heilfroh ber bronze denn seit langem war klar dass fabian nicht in der form ist die f r einen olympiasieg n tig gewesen w re bereits im trainingslager in tokio hatte er schon gro e probleme mit seiner reck bung und konnte sie oft nicht durchturnen
6061665 es war immer ein traum von mir dort einmal mitwirken zu d rfen
6061666 inzwischen kann ich mich schon ein bisschen ber bronze freuen
6061667 der druck als erster turnen zu m ssen war schon brutal

6061727 voor veel organisaties zijn de prestatiebeheertools die ze gebruiken gewoonweg niet goed genoeg wanneer je nagaat dat het overgrote deel van de bedrijven heeft aangegeven dat het prestatievermogen van applicaties op het netwerk kritiek is voor hun bedrijfsactiviteiten is het duidelijk dat applicatieverkeer op een veel proactievere en dynamischere manier moet worden beheerd

6061747 as the burdens on household finances mount our research shows that homeowners in particular should take care
6061748 it is no longer clear that getting a foot on the mortgage ladder is a sensible step the rungs are wobbling
6061749 we are acting on information held either by barclaycard or a credit reference agency which suggest customers may be experiencing financial difficulty
6061750 by taking this action barclaycard aims to help prevent customers from getting into deeper financial problems
6061751 its nice to know they are actually doing what they say they are doing
6061752 the combination of people experiencing increases in fuel bills and rising housing costs puts additional pressure on peoples finances which were already stretched to the limit
6061753 i wouldnt predict a huge increase this year though the recent increases in interest rates may put the squeeze on unsecured borrowing
6061754 all creditors are worried about people dumping debt without them being in genuine financial hardship
6061755 citizens advice bureaux dealt with 1 4 million debt problems in the last financial year
6061756 there are thousands of people who have substantial debt and will never be able to pay it off
6061757 the monthly figures clearly show the cumulative effects of the gradual worsening in affordability for first time buyers and the ever rising proportion of them who are caught by stamp duty
6061758 up until then i had always tried to have it all a career a family and my own business many women within my own community have none of these things the attitude is still that women are meant to stay at home
6061759 i was overcommitted but anyone who starts a business knows that in the first five years of being in business that is the way things go what is the alternative though should you never risk anything
6061760 its not as if i was spending the money on shoes or holidays i used it to invest in a business before i took on that debt the buy to let property was paying for itself
6061761 one of the most difficult things i found was facing up to people in my own community i wanted to be an example and here i was in trouble
6061762 as soon as i knew i would have difficulty i contacted them to explain that i had a short term cash flow crisis and as soon as i could work again it was nigh on impossible to get a new contract when heavily pregnant payments would resume
6061763 in nearly all circumstances i found i came up against a brick wall you would talk to one person they would agree something and then the next time you would speak to someone else and have to start all over
6061764 i wanted to explore what systems lenders have in place they always say talk to us if youre having problems well i tested that
6061765 what i found was far worse than i was expecting
6061766 no one could make decisions and it seemed that as soon as they heard you had difficulties they tried to scare money out of you rather than think how can we approach this customer so that they keep their head above water and we get our money
6061767 a lot of people bundled in having a child with a fancy car or holiday a type of self indulgence rather than a necessity for society
6061768 i am pretty self reliant growing up i faced racial abuse and insults i can handle myself
6061769 i found it very creepy though there were some cruel comments after i wrote that my father had died and then i had someone post on a message board some personal details they had found through companies house
6061770 i face having this debt hang over me for the next decade
6061771 the chief lesson is that debt means a loss of independence it is necessary to borrow if you want to invest but if things go wrong then you are very much on your own
6061772 as things stand i cant take time out of work to be with my child or to have another baby
6061773 i am in a quandary should i ever take financial risk again with the chances that i may suffer a change of circumstances that my average male counterpart would not
6061774 when i first moved here it was nice but now its like the projects

6061778 we have dialed our customers into another overstocked inventory to allow them to make their best deal
6061779 our site provides overstock com customers with information from real estate auctioneers and brokers who have direct access to auction properties and local expertise
6061780 it was very important to us in launching the new area of online auction that we had the expertise of an innovative and technically capable real estate auction company williams amp williams is that company
6061781 they share our vision to provide consumers with new empowered ways to shop for property
6061782 were excited to be able to offer another wide reaching opportunity for consumers to tap into real estate offerings
6061783 joining with overstock com to create a milestone in real estate auctions is aligned with our mission and history to deliver real estate to the marketplace with transparency efficiency and convenience

6061790 we are thrilled to expand our relationship with about com and applaud their efforts to provide this forum to help people quit smoking
6061791 we know the adverse health effects from cigarette smoking account for nearly one of every five deaths each year in the united states our movement is ultimately all about creating and maintaining a healthy lifestyle and quitting smoking is vital
6061792 putting pressure on debtors or third parties is considered to be oppressive
6061793 we need swifter action to protect consumers this lengthy process since our 2005 super complaint is doing little to protect people from ppi rip offs in the meantime
6061794 bankruptcy will be less punishing a sweeter option as a result of these changes
6061795 the idea is to move us to an american system where bankruptcy is not stigmatised and where risk taking is encouraged
6061796 but at the end of the day someone has to pick up the bill for business and personal failure
6061797 where bankrupts can make a contribution they will pay this is not an easy ride
6061798 i dont anticipate that as a result of these reforms we will see bankruptcies rise
6061799 last year only 900 out of 26 500 bankrupts listed the student loan company as a creditor the national union of students has said that bankruptcy is not a free lunch and can prejudice employment prospects
6061800 pursuing third parties for payment when they are not liable
6061801 sending demands for payment to an individual when it is uncertain that they are the debtor in question
6061802 requiring an individual to supply information to prove they are not the debtor
6061803 we found that survival for teenagers and young people with cancer improved overall from 63 per cent between 1979 and 1984 to 74 per cent between 1996 and 2001 which is great news but more needs to be done to drive this figure even higher
6061804 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
6061805 our research has also identified cancers where survival rates remain poor highlighting the need for continuing research in those areas to drive up survival
6061806 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated recruiting more young people on to clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this
6061807 i must have already done this and am just doing what i already did
6061808 our indications are that month on month iva numbers have been falling gradually
6061809 treat all cases of financial difficulty sympathetically and we would urge anyone experiencing problems to contact us at the earliest opportunity

6061821 the shift of brand control from marketers to consumers has been dramatic and swift which can mostly be credited to the advent of digital technologies and the demand for instant information by consumers
6061822 landors clients are embracing this shift and i believe branddigital will provide a roadmap for marketers who recognize the critical need to leverage digital for continued brand growth and success
6061823 digital technology has not changed the basic principles of brand building what once was necessary to do our jobs is still necessary
6061824 whether one refers to it as a channel a medium or a discipline digital technology has served to redefine the scale of power of the essential truths of branding my objective is that everyone who reads this book becomes comfortable inside their digital skins
6061825 with edge sales associates can engage the guest ask questions and input feedback for product recommendations that match the guests preferences and budget
6061826 because edge puts a wealth of information at our associates fingertips we can hire from a broader talent pool and prepare them for the sales floor more quickly
6061827 with consumer electronics products being upgraded as often as every 90 days retailers are pressured to stay on top of all the latest trends while at the same time ensuring competitive pricing clean stores and well stocked shelves
6061828 by using a tablet pc running a windows based application such as edge to elevate sales associates knowledge and effectiveness circuit city is differentiating itself from other retailers and tackling a key issue that all retailers face how to increase customer loyalty and sales with a frequently evolving workforce
6061829 what started as a selling tool turned into something that has removed boundaries from our service model and changed the way that we run our business
6061830 working with microsoft was critical to getting us moving with this concept
6061831 we knew we had to create a more consistent approach to how we engaged guests in our stores and microsoft had the insight to show us where the industry was heading and provided knowledge and resources to move us in that direction
6061832 a large fraction of americans know that we need a jeffersonian political revolution to fix our corrupt system they were not fooled by the obama rhetoric about change not from someone that has been a product of and servant for the two party plutocracy yes all the votes for me and the other third party presidential candidates spelled the difference between obama winning and losing our voters correctly protested against the corrupt two party system they did not elect mccain only those who voted for mccain elected him and that is something they must live with as they watch a mccain administration continue dismantling american democracy and budget busting global warmongering
6061833 it is time to stop saying god bless america and begin repeating god save america the good news is that we will build even greater public support for a true political revolution during the mccain presidency all too often things must get much worse before they can get better they will get worse
6061834 estate agents and others involved in managing real estate are likely to find the next 12 months particularly tough and there will be extensive job cuts
6061835 most of us think that mortgages are priced off the bank of englands base rate but theyre not
6061836 theyre generally priced off the rate at which banks can borrow money from each other and thats gone up very fast as a result of the credit crunch
6061837 mortgage rates for in particular sub prime borrowers and buy to let borrowers have gone up very fast and that means from here on buy to let investors are going to find things more and more expensive
6061838 it looks like i am going to have to subsidise them for a few years to come
6061839 if the rental yield mortgage comparison becomes more and more tricky and they dont expect capital growth they may be forced to put properties on the market which may effectively accelerate the slow down in house price growth
6061840 typical people are couples that are divorcing that cant stand being in the house with each other also people that are involved in a repossession and actually being forced out of their house by the building society because they havent been paying their mortgage
6061841 the decline in prices is caused by the difficulties created for potential house purchasers by the rapid rise in house prices in the last few years a squeeze on spending power and the reduction in credit availability
6061842 the latest data on the housing market are undeniably alarming
6061843 these figures reflect the whole market including people who have help from parents those on high salaries and people who have stepped off the ladder for a few years having made money and are buying again all these people bring down the multiple figure
6061844 the big change in the market in recent times has been lenders moving to affordability
6061845 one mortgage firm now looks at how much rent the applicant is paying and lends according to that
6061846 another lender works out how much rental income can be earned from the borrower letting out a spare room and adds this to the amount of money they are willing to lend
6061847 it is certainly true that in many instances the affordability test is really a way of working out a high income multiple
6061848 it is about lenders making the right decision according to the individuals full circumstances not just salary
6061849 after all it is in no ones interest to lend money to people who will struggle to repay it lenders always lose if they have to repossess
6061850 an interest only mortgage can make sense for some say people who plan to move in a couple of years but not for all
6061851 the danger comes when someone goes for interest only purely because it is cheap and puts nothing in place to pay the capital sum back they get to the end of their mortgage term nearing retirement and they still owe a lot of money
6061852 group mortgages are very much of the moment the obvious advantage is the debt deposit and stamp duty is spread between the purchasers
6061853 people can enter what they want from a housemate a bit like a dating website
6061854 buying with friends is normally a last resort buying with strangers is beyond that for many
6061855 the whole thing has been a mess from the start ill conceived
6061856 most sales collapse because someone pulls out of the chain not because of any information that is set to be contained in the hip
6061857 the idea of hips has been nine years in the making it was in the labour manifesto of 1997 and the queens speech of 2001
6061858 the length of time and the fact we have had six housing ministers allowed opponents to gather their strength
6061859 estate agents simply did not want anyone meddling in their market and mortgage lenders saw a threat to the fees that they charge buyers for valuing a property
6061860 they will need 7 000 assessors to do the job but i have heard on the grapevine they have 1 000 not enough by a long chalk
6061861 even at a period of high market activity there will only be a need for 3 000 to 4 000 inspectors
6061862 remember hips are being launched in june when the market is traditionally quiet there will be enough inspectors to go round
6061863 local authority searches are only going to remain relevant for a few weeks
6061864 no solicitor worth their salt is going to accept a three or four month old search supplied by the buyer after all they risk being sued if things go wrong

6061953 i first met ken probably back in 1991 and ken always supplied free of charge all the sound equipment for our events at the our center it really reflected his enormous heart for the people of longmont and for people in trying situations
6061954 i think it sends a message that were serious about economic development
6061955 we know what their options are we havent taken a position one way or another
6061956 i would think the districts not going to entertain anything thats going to cost them money

6061968 there is no cure for diabetes whatsoever so this kind of event raises funds that will go toward a cure to someone who is doing the research now
6061969 i didnt play all summer so coming back into this first game i just really needed to get off to a good start
6061970 early we were making contact but we were popping it up and we werent hitting it solid
6061971 we just stayed patient and let longmont pitcher leah tanaka throw it across the plate and then we finally started finding the middle of the ball
6061972 she worked her way out of a couple situations and we played defense behind her a couple times
6061973 because weve had to rebuild our program so many times girls go out there without the confidence were all kind of second guessing ourselves on plays and thats what causes the errors it is discouraging but i know all of us can do a lot better
6061974 i think once we get more comfortable there is a lot to look forward to
6061975 its just set the tone for the rest of the week
6061976 i think it was good for me to take the summer off to come back fresh
6061977 it is a male about 60 to 80 pounds were just going to move him back out to more appropriate bear habitat about 60 miles or so miles out northwest he didnt get into any trouble he just kept moving farther and farther into town were hoping that he will stay out in more appropriate bear habitat
6061978 he seems to be just making himself at home in neighborhoods
6061979 i knew the team was counting on me and i needed to keep my head up for them
6061980 that was huge i knew it needed to be done
6061981 she came up big weve been working a lot with her on staying on top of the ball especially on high pitches
6061982 finally she came through sat on top of that pitch and gave it a ride
6061983 i was very nervous to start i wanted to prove to everyone that i could pitch well
6061984 the good is putting 14 runs on the board and winning the game
6061985 but its a good way to get it started we have to make improvements from here to contend we need to clean it up to contend
6061986 nobody here makes any sense i seriously cant understand anything
6061987 but they dont seem to get it they just keep speaking their crazy speak and nobody can understand what they want theyre standing in front of me waving their cameras yelling at me and im just confused and scared
6061988 its like trying to communicate with an infant you know a bunch of tiny little crazy babies who cant quite speak yet but really have a lot to say freaky stuff man

6061994 setelah kejadian itu pihak pemerintah amerika serikat menghubungi saya dia bilang waktu saya jadi bupati beltim sudah diusulkan ke amerika waktu itu tahun 2006 diusulkan untuk tahun 2007 tapi tahun 2007 keburu undur diri ikut pilkada babel
6061995 then how did he get the time to start attending jihadi discussions
6061996 we are against the sects in islam and many rituals for ferozes funeral were also not conducted for the same reason
6061997 ayaz is being harassed by the police because he is ferozes brother who was killed in an encounter a couple of months ago by the anti extortion cell ayaz also had some information about the encounter being a fake one
6061998 last weekend when i met ayaz he told me that the police is only asking him about the information he has regarding his brother and they are not asking him anything in relation to simi

6062007 mail from people im meeting with in the next 2 days
6062008 this is encouraging news obviously the vast majority of these people would under no circumstances use these guns in crimes although they have to be commended for surrendering them
6062009 the real criminals will retain their weapons and we have to combat them
6062010 we welcome the rise in the number of weapons that are being surrendered to us which to some extent marks a changing attitude in society as regards the use of airguns and other firearms
6062011 at the same time the force is pro active in its approach to removing dangerous weapons from our streets which is a key part of our commitment to reducing violent crime and increasing public safety
6062012 the types of weapons that have been surrendered and destroyed include everything from shotguns to air weapons replica guns and other imitation firearms
6062013 i am pleased that these weapons have been taken off the streets those who have surrendered them to the police have done the right thing we know that there is a lot of concern about the minority who misuse firearms and are causing distress damage and injury in their communities
6062014 can we get rid of them entirely probably not all i know is we can do better in appetizers maybe its a panko breaded calamari maybe a baked wing
6062015 our frustration is at what point are we allowed to get our house back we havent even had a chance to stay there overnight at this point

6062017 i was driving home tonight saturday 7 26 2008 at about 8 30 pm and was entertained by a bear roaming around on the road by the bridge over the wash at rubio canyon for a good minute or so this guy looked pretty good sized to me
6062018 yesterday we had a bear in our driveway for the first time we had left our garbage can outside unfortunately by mistake and it was rummaging through the garbage can our daughter took these shots i don t know if this is the same bear that was seen in the rubio canyon bridge but it could be as we are quite close to that
6062019 we had a sighting on tanoble and loma alta on friday night at about 9 or 9 30 p m it was going south on tanoble and then headed up the hill in between houses up to skyview a news truck was also driving around trying to get pictures we notified the sheriff station
6062020 well actually it was the bears contribution and it was quite a while back however within the last week a bear was seen where loma alta terminates at pinecrest so it is probably the same one also within the last month or so two mountain lions were seen in eaton canyon they were spotted by at least one family who lives on the rim off altadena dr by crescent

6062044 the change is not just an election question the change in paraguay is a cultural challenge perhaps the most important in its history
6062045 the inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries
6062046 contrary to the vulgar belief that men are motivated primarily by mate rialistic considerations
6062047 we now see the capitalist system being dis credited and destroyed all over the world even though this system has given men the greatest material com forts
6062048 history suggests that cap italism is a necessary condition for political freedom
6062049 this is all to protect poor muslims from rich christians who buy their organs and vice versa
6062050 if some copts are angered by the law then why is it that muslims are not
6062051 it is degrading for both religions if lets say a poor christian has to sell his kidney to a rich muslim or a poor muslim has to sell his kidney to a rich christian it is not right for either religion and that is why we made this law so we can stop organ trafficking
6062052 it is not about trying to promote differences between religions but its just to minimize the trade of organs as much as we can
6062053 we all have the same egyptian blood but if the reason for the measure is to end organ trafficking we reject it because it may also occur between believers of the same religion
6062054 we are afraid that in the future there will be hospitals for christians and hospitals for muslims
6062055 could lead to discrimination between a muslim and a christian living in the same country
6062056 is discriminatory since it violates human rights the constitution and national unity
6062057 if organ donations are from the third or fourth degree of the family then there is less of a chance of a trade happening as its not likely that family members will sell organs to each other
6062058 no one really comes up and says they want to donate their organs to other people who are not in their family this happens in the west but in egypt it is mostly the poor people who are desperate and end up selling their organs for money

6062067 illegal file sharing is a very serious issue resulting in millions of pounds of losses to copyright owners
6062068 it really is a new world out there and its time the new reality was accepted for what it is
6062069 while not all cases require this level of expediency the bce appeal shows that our court system can respond to the needs of litigants for efficient resolution of disputes
6062070 the average appeal in the supreme court takes approximately 18 months from the filing of the leave application to the rendering of the decision on appeal in the case of the bce appeal this time was compressed to one month
6062071 i have never before seen the supreme court act with anything approaching the speed of the bce appeal
6062072 there is no question that all of the superior courts and courts of appeal are well aware that their reputation in the business world is not good in terms of speed
6062073 there is a reasonable basis for that concern because litigation does take years
6062074 the court has largely been on the periphery of bay streets radar but became its focus overnight with the bce case
6062075 in that context claims of unresponsiveness tend to be overblown
6062076 however while the complaint was overblown the courts docket has shifted to include more business disputes in areas such as corporate commercial law pensions tax class actions and intellectual property
6062077 added to our ability to deal not only with constitutional and criminal law issues but to deal with some important commercial and corporate issues my hope is that we retain our balance

6062117 a stellar 25 year pro life voting record in the congress
6062118 as a catholic journalist i think that catholics and all people deserve an explanation for certain claims that are made by the mccain campaign
6062119 so why does the catholic outreach pamphlet say that john mccain has a stellar pro life voting record in congress
6062120 reprogrammed adult cells display this embryonic characteristic they form fatal tumors in adults
6062121 even when they overcome the problems of using fetal tissue to make ips cells the cells still wont help anyone only adult stem cells are helping people now and only adult stem cells will help people in the future its all about the patients
6062122 while embryonic stem cell research advocates argue that we should make use of extra embryos the bitter bitter irony is that human embryonic stem cells cannot be used at all because they form tumors and lack essential properties needed to maintain mature tissues thus it is a waste of taxpayer dollars to fund human escr
6062123 human embryonic stem cell research is equivalent to abortion because in both cases innocent human beings are killed
6062124 it is inconsistent for john mccain to claim to be pro life and not protect human embryos from experimentation and death claims that mccain is orthodox pro life in opposing abortion but that embryonic research is relatively new and thus need not be seriously addressed are unacceptable
6062125 congress is poised to override the bush standard and push for federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research that involves the deaths of countless human beings in addition to those who are already dying in private research
6062126 discomfort with the notion of extracting stem cells from embryos is understandable but we hope congress will override the presidents veto of the stem cell research enhancement act
6062127 americans should protect innocent human beings at every stage of development and ability and we need a president who realizes this
6062128 i know theres disagreement we had several callers who were concerned about mccains support for embryonic stem cell research im against it im not panicking on the subject because i think john is warm and wonderful and humble and open and right down the line on the rights of the vulnerable i think well get there

6062153 since the arrival of abstract art the term figurative has been used to refer to any form of modern art that retains strong references to the real world
6062154 painting and sculpture can therefore be divided into the categories of figurative representational and abstract although strictly speaking abstract art is derived or abstracted from a figurative or other natural source however the term is sometimes used as a synonym for non representational art and non objective art i e art which has no derivation from figures or objects see what i mean just a bit confused and confusing afternoon tea at the national gallery 11 5

6062183 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
6062184 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
6062185 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

6062203 beneath its gleaming high tech skin the body of israels economy is slightly worn
6062204 much of the countrys traditional industry such as machinery chemicals clothing and food which accounts for more than half of its jobs is lackluster average industrial productivity is around half that in america
6062205 the next stage is just as awful as the first the sex addict abandons any hints of order and takes up with an even more incurable felon the crack addict under crack you steal from the people you should be caring for so since prime minister shamir all other prime ministers have been thieves on a major scale and needless to say they never apologize for their crimes crack addicts dont know right from wrong they only know who is persecuting them in israels case the religious public heads the list when the female sex addict joins with a male crack addict she loses every time but her self esteem is so low she prefers to be robbed and abused because its something she knows and believes she deserves
6062206 at this point the sex addict becomes just like israel friendless even her old friends who once admired her pluckiness are gone she joins her husband in his paranoid attacks against law order and morality they now express support for the enemies of their people and hope they can be strengthened enough to put them out of their nightmare their abject misery is aimed at the still ethical religious community but its all a defense against anyone who can expose them after she takes up with the crack addict the sex addict will say she is impure or has sinned against god but that front will disappear fast enough something much worse is about to happen to her

6062226 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 an ounce
6062227 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6062228 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6062229 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6062230 whenever a process works at a lower temperature that brings energy savings and cost savings
6062231 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost
6062232 further studies into the cellular and molecular processes leading to these changes could have implications for understanding and treating brain infections brain tumors and neurodegenerative disorders
6062233 astrocyte polarization as opposed to hypertrophy may be due to the fact that t cells engage in a very focused attack and the astrocytes respond in a directed polarized manner we know that the astrocytes respond in this polarized manner but we are continuing to investigate precisely why
6062234 we believe this is part of a defensive astrocyte response that may serve to destroy the attacking t cells
6062235 when a t cell recognizes an astrocyte infected with a virus or identified as a foreign cell it launches an attack in response the astrocyte polarizes toward the t cell and may actually end up engulfing the aggressor if so this could be a novel unique mechanism of defense by brain cells against immune cells
6062236 t cells immunological synapses induce polarization of brain astrocytes in vivo and in vitro a novel astrocyte response mechanism to cellular injury
6062237 this is a case where initiating the legislation gives rise to the destruction of an institution
6062238 these considerations should be placed before parliament presently there are hearings which are hearing these issues
6062239 and presently we are sitting as the court looking at these issues that just cant be right that just cant be right
6062240 i am not sure that is the cataclysmic kind of effect that requires interfering with parliament
6062241 how much additional crime are we prepared to tolerate to allow the parliamentary process take its cause

6062245 israel is increasingly willing to explore conversations with states and groups washington would prefer to ignore and isolate
6062246 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
6062247 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
6062248 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
6062249 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well
6062250 june is always an unusual month in the broadcast calendar because most programming is re runs and summer fare
6062251 however there are still a few big network program finales that dominate the ratings such as the 2 hour finale of lost which lead the top commercials for both total viewership and timeshifted viewership interestingly u s open final golf also placed high in total viewership but is nowhere to be found on the timeshifted viewership as the vast majority of viewing occurred live
6062252 what is particularly impressive is that every commercial in the top 10 for timeshifted viewing aired during the lost season finale in fact the top 86 commercials for timeshifted viewing aired during lost the rank order of the specific commercials continues to demonstrate the choices viewers are making about which commercials to watch the top 5 spots in timeshifted viewing were all for movies with the highest spot getting a 7 7 timeshifted rating the lowest spot from this lost episode got a 2 8 timeshifted rating approximately 64 lower than the audience of the highest rated spot

6062276 i decided that on the day the police caught me i would tell the truth because the things that one does in the dark come out in the light i knew i would be caught one day no matter how much i kept quiet
6062277 yes i blame myself to today that i did not do something to pull waheed away and say come waheed
6062278 everything happened so quickly i just wanted to get away
6062279 we say the applicants behaviour violates the elementary principle of judicial ethics
6062280 given the sensitivities that have developed around this matter a court would not like any party to be uncomfortable
6062281 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6062282 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6062283 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6062284 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6062285 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6062286 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6062287 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6062288 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6062289 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
6062290 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear
6062291 here i am this is my new calling card my shorthand statement of identity
6062292 this is a case where initiating the legislation gives rise to the destruction of an institution
6062293 these considerations should be placed before parliament presently there are hearings which are hearing these issues
6062294 and presently we are sitting as the court looking at these issues that just cant be right that just cant be right
6062295 i am not sure that is the cataclysmic kind of effect that requires interfering with parliament
6062296 how much additional crime are we prepared to tolerate to allow the parliamentary process take its cause

6062300 yeah i feel like youre the perfect person for this type of music because of the way your mind thinks
6062301 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks in short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue
6062302 yesterday they said they had no problem with parliament opening and today they have a problem i have no comment on that

6062308 there is no difference from one agreement to the other
6062309 we have seen a recent increase in the number of isps that are accessing our database of urls known to contain child pornography
6062310 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things

6062316 i would love to see even more athletes involved in speaking out about not only what i believe in but what they believe in as well
6062317 i think that the games have run with amazing efficiency i believe that the chinese people are warm and have been generally wonderful hosts to the games
6062318 even if there was an athlete that wanted to speak out on issues of human rights he might be silenced by whatever ioc official is mediating that press event
6062319 massive suppression of any voice that the government doesnt want heard
6062320 the chinese governments own voluntary pledges to improve human rights allow public protests and guarantee complete freedom to report made meeting these self set human rights benchmarks one of the tests for a successful olympics
6062321 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed
6062322 may leave in place permanent technological surveillance and monitoring networks that make doing human rights work even more dangerous and difficult for chinese citizens
6062323 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia
6062324 but it could get even uglier in russia journalists are not only harassed they are sometimes murdered
6062325 silent diplomacy is fine but it has to be matched by change on the ground
6062326 if theres no evidence of change you have to back that up with public pressure
6062327 were a sports organization we stay clearly within our role which is to bring sport to host countries
6062328 were not an organization that is best placed or has the capacity to deal with human rights issues
6062329 tibet is part of china the whole world knows that
6062330 the goal for the chinese government is to promote nationalism further
6062331 but ironically the olympic games exposed more social crises than ever like the tibet issue to the chinese people
6062332 in the end they pretty much defined the terms in which the media was going to operate
6062333 those terms are not the same as in the western world

6062351 un experto de la universidad nacional autonoma de mexico pronostico que en alrededor de diez anos la tierra entrara a una pequena era de hielo que durara de 60 a 80 anos y sera causada por la disminucion de la actividad solar
6062352 disconcerting as it may be to true believers in global warming the average temperature on earth has remained steady or slowly declined during the past decade despite the continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and now the global temperature is falling precipitously
6062353 the reason this matters is that there is a close correlation between variations in the sunspot cycle and earths climate the previous time a cycle was delayed like this was in the dalton minimum an especially cold period that lasted several decades from 1790 northern winters became ferocious in particular the rout of napoleons grand army during the retreat from moscow in 1812 was at least partly due to the lack of sunspots

6062367 understanding of and knowledge about muslim prisoners was particularly weak and there was insufficient management scrutiny of race issues in general
6062368 these include prisoners who are dangerous but also prisoners who are vulnerable
6062369 inspectors found that there was no evidence of a robust violence reduction strategy which is essential to ensure safety order and control there was little management analysis of data on bullying intimidation or self harm
6062370 high security prisons require constant and vigorous management in order safely to contain and work effectively with their challenging populations
6062371 franklands population had become even more challenging recently with increases in gang affiliations and the arrival of a small number of convicted terrorists
6062372 it is unfortunate that this coincided with the absence of the governor for some months and the resulting drift that was observable at this inspection needs urgently to be reversed
6062373 i am pleased that the chief inspector has acknowledged the excellent multidisciplinary relationships within the dspd unit which deals with some of the most challenging prisoners in the system
6062374 i am concerned about the comments raised on the safety within frankland however this should be seen in the context of franklands extremely challenging population
6062375 a new diversity and safer prisons manager is now in post to ensure a focus on the matters raised by the inspector in relation to anti bullying and diversity
6062376 anne owers is warning of drift in key areas particularly safety

6062453 13 years ago after my wife and unborn child were attacked by a shark while swimming at the beach we realized the importance of providing emergency information for small communities and public service organizations
6062454 our original idea was to create a shark alert service but then we realized that there was an immediate need for a service that provided a much broader range of emergency information with added functionality
6062455 nor do we expect the organizations who are deploying alert services to be rocket scientists so we created this program so that anyone could make it work without specialized programming ability we do the web hosting so all you have to do is configure our template for your alert application and add the contact information for the people who need to be alerted

6062497 the board felt that a more appropriate measure to reward performance was to base the goals on increases in profitability rather than changes to stock price solely over time

6062502 we were so impressed with the water filter on a number of levels cost quality and product so we decided to offer this product to the world
6062503 there are a number of things that people should realize about their water
6062504 take the impurities from your bathing water drinking water or your cooking water
6062505 our business presents a water purifier that comes right into your tap after it goes through your purifier instead of going through the pipes in your house and picking up impurities i believe that this water purifier is a healthier choice
6062506 one of the things we like about the blog is the ability for us and other people to see the water filters out there
6062507 we want other people to talk about why our water filter has the best quality and how we can clearly outline that
6062508 she was the most caring person i have ever known
6062509 even if she was upset or unhappy she would always think of others first and offer sympathy and support
6062510 she didnt want people to worry about her so she would keep her troubles to herself whilst putting on a brave face for the rest of the world
6062511 she was dedicated to her twin boys and sacrificed a lot to keep them happy
6062512 she has achieved so much in her life and was about to embark on a new course when her life was cruelly taken from her we miss her so much
6062513 i began by making personalized items for our maltese dogs lexie and princeton
6062514 and soon i found that many of my friends and relatives were also looking for the same items they requested me to make those items for them and in a short time i had the opportunity to create a business
6062515 i select and procure the fabric we use two outside sewing houses who manufacture all of our products locally
6062516 the blog will provide people with valuable information about their pets
6062517 we have been overwhelmed by the response to our website and are delighted to see such great feedback related to the quality and originality of our products
6062518 splashtop is a game changing product in the personal computing space

6062520 in college i signed up for every credit card that was offered to me so i left school with student loans and more than 3 000 in credit card debt
6062521 it took me nearly nine years to repair the financial damage
6062522 credit card debt impacts more than just your wallet today it can also affect your credit score well beyond your college years
6062523 the good news is students who understand their spending limits adhere to a budget and make payments on time can build a solid foundation for future financial success

6062525 were glad to have students from so many great schools participate in this inaugural poll
6062526 its great to be able to add the opinions of these college journalists to playboys coverage of college football and college sports in general even if their ultimate pick of georgia over my preseason number one oklahoma is dead wrong
6062527 through its blue cross and blue shield plans wellpoint is one of the largest private healthcare payers in the u s and covers almost 35 million lives throughout its networks

6062530 the delivery of the buildings went very smoothly we were very impressed by what was achieved within a short time frame konstructa also supplied the furniture so we were up and running very quickly the accommodation has exceeded all our expectations and we are just as delighted with the professional service
6062531 for so god help us we will never give up that holy law that noble prophets laid down their lives to maintain
6062532 it is an eternal part of our religion and we will never relinquish it we cannot withdraw or renounce it he has promised to maintain it
6062533 we wont quit practicing plural marriage until christ shall come
6062534 though i go to prison god will not change his law of celestial marriage
6062535 there are however enough witnesses to these principles to establish them upon the earth in such a manner that they never can be forgotten or stamped out for they will live they are bound to prevail because they are true principles
6062536 the time would never come when children of polygamous parents would cease to be born in the church
6062537 no year will ever pass whether it be in this country mexico in india or wherever from now until the coming of the saviour when children will not be born in plural marriage
6062538 when the church had gone to the devil or the priesthood taken from this people then god would give it to another people
6062539 to renounce the doctrine and promise not to obey the revelation such an action is impossible
6062540 as god lives the principle will not be driven from the earth
6062541 how can god withdraw an everlasting principle from the earth he has not and cannot
6062542 i have saved my servant john taylor for a wise purpose in me
6062543 what would be necessary to bring about the result nearest the hearts of the opponents of mormonism
6062544 the powers of hell will do their utmost to get this people to give up that holy law which god designs to maintain
6062545 prohibiting polygamy and making it a crime with a severe penalty
6062546 95 per cent 13 000 of all the mormon voters in the territory voted for the ratification of this convention
6062547 to be at peace with the government and in harmony with their fellow citizens who are not of their faith and to share in the confidence of the government and the people our people have voluntarily put aside something which all their lives they have believed to be a sacred principle
6062548 if there is any one thing that some people are glad and happy is done away with it is that principle
6062549 the only men who become gods even sons of god are those who enter into polygamy
6062550 today probably no modern people is more anti polygamy than the orthodox mormons
6062551 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life
6062552 youve got to say i think that if i keep working at this and want it badly enough i can have it its called perseverance
6062553 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life
6062554 mormon fundamentalists believe that the more wives they marry in mortality the greater their eternal reward is this a true doctrine
6062555 mormons believe that having larger families brings them greater blessings is this a true doctrine
6062556 he joseph said men must beware how they treat their wives they were given them for a holy purpose that the myriads of spirits waiting for tabernacles might have pure and healthy bodies he also said many would awake in the morning of the resurrection sadly disappointed for they by transgression would have neither wives nor children for they surely would be taken from them and given to those who should prove themselves worthy again he said a woman would have her choice this was a privilege that could not be denied her
6062557 but how i asked can i teach my sister what i myself do not understand or show her what i do not myself see but you will see and understand it he said and when you open your mouth to talk to your sister light will come to you and your mouth will be full and your tongue loose and i will today preach a sermon to you that none but you will understand both of these promises were more than fulfilled the text of his sermon was our use of the one five and ten talents and as god had now commanded plural marriage and as exaltation and dominion of the saints depended upon the number of their righteous posterity from him who was then but with one talent it would be taken and given him that had ten which item of doctrine seems now to be somewhat differently constructed
6062558 what is the meaning of the parable of the 10 talents what is the meaning of the scripture that he that is faithful over a few things shall be made ruler over many and he that is faithful over many shall be made ruler over many more
6062559 joseph smith said that the parable that jesus spoke of that the man who had one talent and hid it in the earth was the man who had but one wife and would not take another would have her taken from him and given to the one who had the more
6062560 and behold there was lifted up a talent of lead and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of ephah
6062561 there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of gods sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting
6062562 what to eve though in her mortal life if shed been the first the tenth or fiftieth wife
6062563 seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach
6062564 if they are not more faithful unto me it shall be taken away even that which they have
6062565 every man may improve upon his talent that every man may gain other talents yea even an hundred fold
6062566 the day will come when mens priesthood and authority will be called into question and you will find out that there will be hundreds who have no priesthood but believe they hold it they holding only an office in the church
6062567 the entire church and all of its priesthood with the presidency at the head of it might motion and vote against this principle until doomsday with just one effect namely to vote themselves away from the fellowship of the holy ghost from the possession of their priesthood
6062568 the conferring of the priesthood should precede and accompany ordination to an office unless it is possessed by previous bestowal and ordination
6062569 do not forget to confer the high priesthood upon them
6062570 surely a man cannot possess an appendage to the priesthood without possessing the priesthood itself which he cannot obtain unless it be authoritatively conferred upon him
6062571 no being can give that which he does not possess consequently no man can confer the priesthood on another if he has not himself first received it
6062572 the priesthood can not continue when the gospel is perverted
6062573 that the ordinances must be kept in the very way god has appointed otherwise their priesthood will prove a cursing instead of a blessing
6062574 toughbook computer solution providers are core to the continued success of panasonic

6062576 interest in election 2008 even across blogs weve never heard mention politics before is extraordinary and growing
6062577 bloghers omni partisan coverage and strong community guidelines have created a unique environment that encourages policy discussion and civil debate by women across the political spectrum blogher is a grassroots forum where among other things candidates can communicate directly with women who vote and voters can answer back
6062578 we love seeing women using political coverage to stay informed about issues
6062579 we think convention hub will give bloghers readers fast access to important video from the two political conventions and at the same time the hubs bloggers roundup will introduce new readers to the issues you cover
6062580 we will continue to provide content that engages the broad spectrum of women who are a part of the blogher community as we work against the stereotype that all women think write or vote alike

6062584 we expect that this perf go green delivery will last the organization for about one heating season
6062585 by integrating sustainability targets and goals into the redesign of key supply chain areas companies are better able to balance the goals of the responsive cost effective and resilient supply chain with a wider concept of costs that include factors that are economic environmental and social the optimal balance of such factors result in top service and increased profitability
6062586 supply chains can become out of tune due to factors like mergers and acquisitions and fluctuating fuel costs
6062587 infor scm network design helps companies continually evaluate their networks so they can implement and maintain more cost and carbon efficient supply chains

6062600 instituted in heaven before the foundation of this world in the priesthood for the salvation of man
6062601 must be kept in the very way god has appointed otherwise their priesthood will prove a cursing instead of a blessing
6062602 the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom shall not be taken from
6062603 can any man or set of men officiate in dispensing the laws and administering the ordinances of the kingdom of god or of the kingdoms and governments of the world legally without first obeying those laws and submitting to those ordinances themselves do not forget that no man has authority to officiate in the ordinances of heavenly or earthly governments only so far as he has obeyed them himself
6062604 the spirit power and calling of elijah is that ye have power to hold the key of the revelation ordinances oracles powers and endowments of the fullness of the melchizedek priesthood and of the kingdom of god on the earth and to receive obtain and perform all the ordinances belonging to the kingdom of god
6062605 an angel of god told him that unless he moved forward and establish plural marriage his priesthood would be taken from him
6062606 when this commandment was given it was so far religious and so far binding upon the elders of this church that it was told them if they were not prepared to enter into it and to stem the torrent of opposition that would come in consequence of it the keys of the kingdom would be taken from them and given to others
6062607 thus saith the lord to the twelve and to the priesthood and people of my church you may appoint seymour b young to fill up the vacancy in the presiding quorum of seventies if he will conform to my law for it is not meet that men who will not abide my law shall preside over my priesthood for my priesthood whom i have called and whom i have sustained and honored shall honor one and obey my laws and the laws of my holy priesthood or they shall not be considered worthy to hold my priesthood saith the lord
6062608 apart from the exalting purpose of this divine law why was it so essential to the issue of priesthood authority
6062609 a man obeying a lesser law is not qualified to preside over those who keep a higher law
6062610 my greatest happiness i find in the goodwill and friendship that has developed among all classes of people at home and abroad toward the lds church during my lifetime
6062611 a spirit of speculation and extravagance will take possession of the saints and the result will be financial bondage
6062612 this people at some future time may be possible be in bondage greater than they are at the present time
6062613 if all israel will not be sanctified by the law which their moses first offers them they will peradventure receive a law of ordinances administered to them not according to the power of an endless life
6062614 the reason the manifesto was given and the principle laid aside was that many of those who entered into that principle were not keeping the commandments and that not over two percent of the latter day saints ever entered into that principle
6062615 the devil is ruling over his kingdom and my spirit has no place in the hearts of the rulers of this nation and the devil stirs them up to defy my power and make war upon the saints
6062616 beginning to be fulfilled that the whole nation would turn against zion and make war upon the saints
6062617 it was given unto him the beast to make war with the saints and to overcome them
6062618 if the saints will hearken unto my voice the wicked shall not prevail
6062619 i wish to remind you of a certain revelation given you through president taylor
6062620 there is nothing that would soon weaken my hope and discourage me as to see this people in full fellowship with the world and receive no more persecution from them because they are one with them
6062621 the sin of adultery is running rampant through the church
6062622 i remember very accurately what my father told this people in the old bowery
6062623 i want to say that that prediction sorrowful though it may seem has had its fulfillment
6062624 many of this people have broken their covenants by finding fault with the plurality of wives and trying to sink it out of existence
6062625 what would be necessary to bring about the result nearest the hearts of the opponents of mormonism more properly termed the gospel of the son of god
6062626 president kimball once prophesied to this people and especially to the mothers that if they spoke disrespectfully of a certain principle of the gospel and fought against it the day would come when their daughters would turn aside and lose their virtue and become objects of immorality upon the streets of salt lake city i want to say that that prediction sorrowful though it may seem has had its fulfillment
6062627 you will live to see men arise in power in the church who will seek to put down your friends and the friends of our lord and saviour jesus christ
6062628 though they may imprison or kill most mormons there will always be someone left to carry on the work
6062629 woe unto those who cut men off from the church for private pique or to exercise undue dominion or for any reason not prompted by truth and righteousness
6062630 i tell you the salvation that will come to this people will be through the faithfulness of the men of god and the women of god who in the face of an opposing world contrary to their traditions to their education to their pre conceived notions and to the popular prejudices of the day who have in the midst of all this stepped forward in the vanguard and obeyed the command of god and have dared to endure all the consequences and have been willing to endure all the penalties
6062631 i did not like the old man being called up for erring in doctrine it looks too much like the methodists and not like the latter day saints methodists have creeds which a man must believe or be asked out of their church i want the liberty of thinking and believing as i please it feels so good not to be trammelled it does not prove that a man is not a good man because he errs in doctrine
6062632 persons sometimes say that they have enjoyed the spirit of the work as much since they were cut off as while they were in the church have they enjoyed the spirit yes why simply because they were wrongfully cut off they were cut off in a way that it did not not take the spirit of the god from them and the reason why they were cut off was because they didnt come to the particular standard of perfection of those who dealt with them or they did not come up to their feelings
6062633 no endowments or blessings in the house of the lord no patriarchal blessings no ordination to the priesthood can be taken away once given to prevent for just cause from exercising the rights and privileges of acting in the offices of acting in the priesthood within the church may be and has been done and the person so silenced still remain a member of the church but this does not take away from him any priesthood that he held
6062634 while the study once again illustrates the importance of a college education to americans it also points to areas of focus for all of us interested in higher education
6062635 for example too few parents and students are focusing on the total cost of college not enough are using available college savings tools too many are borrowing without considering how they will repay and too many are not completing federal financial aid forms that enable them to access free federal financial aid and lower cost student loans for our part sallie mae is committed to making it easier for families to navigate the financial aid system for example we counsel customers to follow a 1 2 3 approach to paying for college so that they exhaust grants and scholarships explore federal loans and fill any gap with private education loans
6062636 this study marks a very important milestone for the prevention of vap in hospitals one of the major benefits of the agento r i c silver coated endotracheal tube is that it is the first prevention option available that requires no further action after placement by the healthcare provider
6062637 in developing the agento r i c silver coated endotracheal tube bard sponsored the largest randomized controlled trial in the field of vap prevention and we are pleased that the efforts of the independent clinical investigators have been recognized by such a renowned scientific journal publication in jama reflects the quality of their study and significance of their results we look forward to the benefits that the agento r i c silver coated endotracheal tube can provide hospitals and clinicians in their efforts to reduce the incidence of vap and improve patients lives

6062651 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world

6062726 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6062727 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
6062728 on this issue we fully support russia georgia started this crisis but the west is blaming russia
6062729 the entire front line of the armys brass stepped down because of the war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6062730 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learned why the israeli generals failed what happened in georgia is a message to all those the americans are seeking to entangle in dangerous adventures
6062731 in questo senso avverto lurgenza di facilitare lingresso nei nostri circoli di dare la parola agli iscritti di chiamarli a decidere di mescolare le appartenenze in un confronto veramente democratico di sradicare filiere di comando che partono dal centro e vanno gi per i rami fino allultimo comune italiano di aprirsi alla ricerca culturale alla battaglia delle idee alla formazione delle nuove generazioni
6062732 the sloanes and their political wing the tories have colonised traditional liberal labour territory in an audacious ideological landgrab
6062733 this is blitzkrieg total warfare and last week the panzer divisions of the ideological wing of the conservative party managed to take the equivalent of poland claiming for themselves not only the entire british seaside but also the smiths radiohead and gorillaz for as well as trouncing gordon in the first inaugural fake holiday photo op head to head cameron also presented a selection of his favourite cds to barack obama and in so doing branded them with the conservative stamp
6062734 everything that i as a paid up guardian reading organic muesli eating red ken voting farmers market visiting lentil cooking metropolitan living city cyclist hold dear being nice to battery chickens and veal calves buying fish that has been caught by a grizzled old man using nothing more technologically advanced than a bit of a string buying only the most humanitarian coffee beans known to man suddenly all these things seem to have become not only part of the conservative party manifesto but also and believe me it pains me to say this posh
6062735 a bike it turns out is not a handy way of getting around but an essential lifestyle accessory for an ambitious modern conservative in search of a job in a future government its not even just boris and cameron george osborne camerons mini me has started cycling into work as well as david willetts and oliver letwin and dozens upon dozens of younger backbench tory wannabes its almost enough to make you leave your bike unlocked in a public place and paint a big arrow pointing to it saying nick me
6062736 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things

6062738 we hoped that billy after the rest he had the swelling would be reduced
6062739 all theyve told me is to take some time let the inflammation get out of the elbow and wait for it to feel better
6062740 were in first place and were in a great situation right now i think we have a great chance to be in the playoffs and i want to be a part of that to me im very frustrated because theres not much i can do
6062741 the only thing i can do is take my anti inflammatory pills and just rest
6062742 all of us on the team i think we all kind of took it for granted that when youve got billy down there in the ninth inning hes going to basically shut it down
6062743 i think everyone has kind of realized that its kind of a tough job
6062744 take the case my brothers of someone who has never done a single good act but claims that he has faith will that faith save him if one of the brothers or one of the sisters is in need of clothes and has not enough food to live on and one of you says to them i wish you well keep yourself warm and eat plenty without giving them these bare necessities of llife then what good is that if good works do not go with it it is quite dead this is the way to talk to people of that kind you say you have faith and i have good deeds i will prove to you that i have faith by showing you my good deeds now you prove to me that you have faith without any good deeds to show you believe in one god that is creditable enough but the demons have the same belief and they tremble with fear do realise you senseless man that faith without works is useless you surely know that abraham our father was justified by his deed because he offered isaac on the altar there you see it faith and good deeds were working together his faith became perfect by what he did this is what scripture really means when it says abraham put his faith in god and this was counted as makinh him justified and that is why he was called the friend of god you see now that it is by doing something good and not only by believing that a man is justified

6062759 burning kerosene at 30 000 feet is never a good idea
6062760 inflatable toys amp other objects require approval by the parks and recreation director
6062761 i believe there is a fantastic history of artistry in hip hop and i also believe there are artists who arent brandishing guns and celebrating the abuse of women the broadway center is committed to diverse access but also in making sure our venues are safe and welcoming for the entire community the upcoming community dialogue is designed to empower our community to better serve the hip hop audience

6062769 terremark is ideally suited to meet preferred hotel groups dynamic needs as our enterprise cloud services enable enterprises to dynamically provision infrastructure to meet precise computing needs in minutes instead of weeks
6062770 we need someone to hold us together while we get our search for the real guy going
6062771 lets see how this guy does before we put him under long term contract
6062772 first and foremost the responsibility is to have theatre of integrity and to be able to gain and earn the respect of your audience
6062773 its easy to to say were bringing professional theatre back into tacoma but im determined not to ignore nor to alienate the community and the way to avoid that is to make it inclusive not exclusive
6062774 were all one community somehow weve got to cross talk and cross pollinate
6062775 we want to try to bring as much of the community as we can its not going to happen in the first production but its a program that were going to put together and work towards the directors will be the first to say that there are people in the community that are as professional as some of the most professional people that theyve worked with
6062776 the resident director will act as the liaison between the guest and the producing artistic director they will be responsible for reviewing the show with the director theyll watch the show periodically and make sure that it adheres to the standards were trying to keep
6062777 we bring it intact as a complete production we dont have to use the facilities of theatre on the square other than for the venue itself
6062778 it maximizes the centers ability to use the space for other programs and minimizes costs incurred by both organizations
6062779 were using our production strength and were using the marketing and venue strength of the broadway center
6062780 until we know our audience and until we re establish that credibility with the tacoma audience i think were going to have to start by doing plays that will bring the most people in because without the public coming through the door it doesnt matter what you do
6062781 you have to earn the respect of the audience the audience then trusts you to put on the best productions possible regardless of the show when this process begins to happen you can take steps to show plays that are more outside the mainstream
6062782 if we cant put 150 people in the seats per show in theatre on the square with rod as morrie with charlotte directing with kurt designing youre going to be able to knock me over with a twig
6062783 so many people are involved in theatre all the actors all the crew the six degrees of separation from all of them when it stops there truly is a huge void in the community
6062784 we as porsche workforce can maintain our independence andmust not subjugate ourselves
6062785 the co determination agreements duration of 10 years andthe right for porsche employees to veto a termination of thisdeal are from our viewpoint not negotiable
6062786 i would sell out my own people we would simply be justanother vw site then
6062787 i am pleased to report this quarter that deep down continues to improve its financial position the company is now essentially debt free and has retired all of its remaining preferred shares liquidity is strong with unrestricted cash and equivalents of 4 1 million and a current ratio of 3 8 our working capital position is 10 8 million stockholders equity has improved dramatically and is now 52 9 million compared to 12 6 million on december 31 2007 we remain excited and optimistic about the prospects for continued revenue growth and a return to profitability
6062788 companies still view the international market as the area for growth and are continuing to find new ways to invest in foreign markets and expand their operations
6062789 among domestic companies the level of pessimism rose dramatically over the past year but may have plateaued
6062790 while we certainly have some major problems in certain sectors of the economy such as construction automotive and financial institutions our diverse economy has provided some comfort that we can weather this storm and better times lie ahead
6062791 the most successful companies are continuing to invest in r amp d during the downturn and trying to make sure that the products and services they offer are responsive to customers needs
6062792 companies that arent investing in r amp d are missing a significant opportunity those that are will emerge from the downturn in a much stronger position
6062793 in our view the tariff hike will be followed by further policy measures
6062794 given the widespread belief that the chinese economy and capital markets will experience post olympic slumps we judge that the government has been storing up a slew of stimulating policies aiming to implement them close to the end of the olympic games
6062795 the top leadership is carefully considering an economic stimulus package of at least 200 billion yuan to 400 billion yuan or 29 billion to 58 billion
6062796 i think the government is likely to take more stimulative measures but whether its in the form of hundreds of billions of yuan in direct fiscal spending i have no idea
6062797 equipment imports look solid and there is still strong demand for bank loans suggesting that the investment slowdown is caused more by tighter money rather than the lack of investment appetite from corporate china
6062798 we expect the quarter will again be characterized bymark to market valuation adjustments in mortgage backedsecurities commercial mortgage backed securities andcollateralized debt obligations holdings as well asineffective hedge performance

6062848 lifeclinic is committed to helping our retailer customers design and implement programs that can help control their organizations healthcare costs for example when our health stations identify an employee who is pre hypertensive there is an opportunity for early intervention and education to promote generally recommended lifestyle changes which in turn may allow the employee to forgo the need for costly medications visits to the doctor and missed days of work obviously this also benefits the employers bottom line for those people who our health stations identify as being hypertensive the employees healthcare provider can be called upon to immediately address factors such as lack of exercise unhealthy diet obesity and bad lifestyle habits and may also recommend inexpensive medication that will prevent the much higher costs of hospitalization and lost productivity

6062859 die herstellung eines stabilen friedens in der region sowie einer atmosph re des vertrauens und der stabilit t ist f r die t rkei von lebenswichtiger bedeutung
6062860 133 namen k nnen wir im moment nennen wir waren bei der beerdigung anwesend es gibt aber zahlreiche gr ber bei denen wir nicht sagen k nnen wie viele menschen dort liegen diese opfer haben wir noch nicht mitgez hlt bevor wir das tun m ssen wir die aussagen der hinterbliebenen auswerten
6062861 w hrend lukaschenkos position zum konflikt in s dossetien bis zum dienstag beraus reserviert war ist heute zu merken dass die wei russische f hrung die situation offenkundig anders eingesch tzt weil erkannt hat dass ein konflikt mit russland f r sie weit gef hrlicher w re
6062862 nachdem es medwedew jedoch wohl gelungen ist als antwort auf das hnliche abkommen zwischen polen und den usa die aufstellung von raketenabwehrwaffen im nachbarstaat zu vereinbaren wird es lukaschenko m glicherweise gelingen einen konsens bei den gaslieferungen zu erreichen
6062863 alles wurde ausgezeichnet getan sehr ruhig weise und in sch nheit
6062864 ist der moment f r keineswegs einfache handlungen im rahmen des unionsstaates gekommen
6062865 in der ffentlichkeit wird ein maximal scharfer ton angeschlagen aber nur so scharf um die kompromissfindung nicht zu gef hrden
6062866 jetzt tief gespalten ist in jene die moskau bestrafen m chten und jene die ihre gesch ftskontakte mit russland wie sonst pflegen wollen
6062867 in dieser hinsicht haben sich die positionen seit april nicht gro ver ndert als georgien das recht auf die nato mitgliedschaft verweigert wurde und gegner der harten linie gegen ber moskau sind vor allem frankreich und deutschland geblieben
6062868 f r die amerikaner ist der konflikt in georgien nur eine missgl ckte kraftprobe im raum der ehemaligen udssr f r das alte europa ist es von bedeutung dass georgien diese furchtbare humanit re krise provoziert hat aber auch nicht minder von bedeutung dass russland au erhalb der verantwortungszone der friedenstruppen gewalt angewandt hat
6062869 sowohl iran der faktisch die schaffung einer interkontinentalrakete bekannt gegeben hat als auch das unruhige pakistan verbleiben indes ist die berwindung dieser zwei krisen ohne zusammenarbeit mit moskau unm glich
6062870 im falle eines direkten konflikts mit russland ihre ressourcen selbst zum schutz der ergebensten verb ndeten beschr nkt sind
6062871 so ernsthafte probleme wurden in diesem format seit langem nicht mehr er rtert und der heutige beschluss zeugt von der hilflosigkeit der nato
6062872 w hrend lukaschenkos position zum konflikt in s dossetien bis zum dienstag beraus reserviert war ist heute zu merken dass die wei russische f hrung die situation offenkundig anders eingesch tzt weil erkannt hat dass ein konflikt mit russland f r sie weit gef hrlicher w re
6062873 nachdem es medwedew jedoch wohl gelungen ist als antwort auf das hnliche abkommen zwischen polen und den usa die aufstellung von raketenabwehrwaffen im nachbarstaat zu vereinbaren wird es lukaschenko m glicherweise gelingen einen konsens bei den gaslieferungen zu erreichen
6062874 alles wurde ausgezeichnet getan sehr ruhig weise und in sch nheit
6062875 ist der moment f r keineswegs einfache handlungen im rahmen des unionsstaates gekommen
6062876 falls sie sich eine frontale kollision w nschen sie werden sie bekommen selbstredend wird es auf unserem territorium russische st tzpunkte und alles andere geben denn weder russland noch abchasien haben keinen anderen weg die unabh ngigkeit abchasiens muss anerkannt werden ein milit rvertrag muss unterschrieben werden die st tzpunkte der russischen armee m ssen ebenfalls errichtet werden doch das wichtigste haben wir bereits vom russischen pr sidenten erfahren russland bleibt im kaukasus die meinung des westens ist uns ehrlich gesagt wurscht
6062877 russland muss um den eigenen erfolg zu sichern und die eroberten positionen nicht zu verlieren die unabh ngigkeit abchasiens und s dossetiens anerkennen
6062878 sonst k nnte es zu sp t sein die aufnahme georgiens in die nato k nnte gestartet werden falls tiflis eine erneute gegen uns gerichtete aggression anfangen wird wird russland nicht in der lage sein sich einzumischen und uns zu besch tzen denn dann w re es gezwungen mit den nato truppen zu k mpfen
6062879 heute handelt es sich dabei um eine halb museumsreife ansammlung verschiederartiger kr fte
6062880 wenn sich die amerikaner poti und batumi n hern werden wir nur ein mittel haben um das gesicht zu wahren unsere schiffe abziehen
6062881 das mandat der friedenskr fte l sst uns ruhig in den gew ssern abchasiens verweilen zumal dort in den n chsten monaten alles ruhig sein wird doch die n he die uns bevorsteht ist gef hrlich provokationen sind m glich
6062882 das schwarze meer ist kein ozean flugzeuge decken es mit leichtigkeit ab
6062883 h tte s dossetien eine starke armee gehabt so h tte sich unsere einmischung auf eine unterst tzung aus der luft beschr nken k nnen
6062884 gleich der erste zusammensto mit einer bei weitem nicht besten ausl ndischen armee hat gezeigt dass die georgier bessere flugzeuge panzer und nachrichtenmittel haben was w re erst wenn sie jagdflugzeuge und eine moderne luftverteidigung h tten wir haben einfach gl ck gehabt dass die georgischen soldaten wie sich erweist einen schwachen geist haben
6062885 elotuzumab provides us with the opportunity to develop and market an innovative therapy that has the potential to meaningfully address the significant unmet medical need in multiple myeloma
6062886 consistent with our companys strategy to integrate external innovation and to expand our capabilities this collaboration will further strengthen our pipeline of agents targeting hematologic malignancies which includes sprycel r and tanespimycin an hsp90 inhibitor from our recent acquisition of kosan biosciences
6062887 we are delighted to enter this global alliance with bristol myers squibb which we believe will maximize the potential benefit of elotuzumab to patients and highlight the value of our scientific discoveries and antibody technologies to the field
6062888 in addition bristol myers squibb brings extensive oncology development experience and resources and we look forward to collaborating with them to increase the scope of the elotuzumab development program moving forward
6062889 we believe that tevas expertise and knowledge in successfully conducting large pivotal clinical trials and in developing markets for large unmet medical needs will prove invaluable in maximizing multikines potential this agreement is consistent with our strategy to share the clinical and regulatory expenses associated with the development of multikine while retaining rights to market multikine in north america and europe

6062892 half our band practice is spent with us going you hear about this
6062893 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6062894 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6062895 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6062896 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6062897 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6062940 many people thought it would be a problem but the fact of the matter is that the concerns were unfounded
6062941 we have had 100 compliance days in august and nine great single days
6062942 without these measures the current air quality would have been impossible
6062943 compared with previous host cities beijing has taken the most intense efforts in cutting emissions and ensuring no pollution
6062944 many people thought it would be a problem but the fact of the matter is that the concerns were unfounded
6062945 air pollution depends on a combination of the emitting source and the meteorological situation
6062946 here in beijing we had favourable meteorological conditions coupled with some reduction of emissions
6062947 um artista n o precisa sofrer para mostrar sofrimento ele s tem que entender o sofrimento a intui o o principal instrumento de um artista sou uma pessoa feliz por dentro mas minhas hist rias refletem o mundo real e vivemos num mundo negativo
6062948 nunca o estado teve tantos editores com qualidades t o profissionais
6062949 o momento atual um salto de qualidade na literatura do rio grande do norte hoje um autor que queira publicar tem v rias op es editoriais para colocar seu livro na pra a
6062950 foi uma simples quest o de parar de reclamar que ningu m fazia e resolver fazer por conta pr pria
6062951 quem gosta de literatura gosta de ler livro nosso plano colocar bons t tulos de bons autores com uma qualidade material boa para quem gosta do livro como objeto
6062952 o estado apesar de contar com grandes dramaturgos n o tem tradi o editorial no teatro
6062953 nesse sentido viemos para preencher uma lacuna mais art stica do que mercadol gica
6062954 o absurdo est em os livros serem destinados classe m dia todos deveriam ter acesso a uma boa educa o para desenvolver o h bito prazeroso da leitura o fato que se n o fosse a lei de incentivo n o ter amos publicado quatro livros de autores estreantes que com as vendas est o podendo publicar outras edi es de suas obras ou mesmo outros livros dando seq ncia ao trabalho liter rio
6062955 n o aceito nem repudio essa id ia apenas acredito que deve se pensar na democratiza o e expans o do mercado
6062956 o problema das leis de incentivo que existe muita burocracia preciso que voc estude bem antes de poder utilizar de uma maneira que valha a pena melhor seria que esse dinheiro fosse usado para comprar livros de autores locais e abastecer as bibliotecas p blicas
6062957 hoje em dia com essas facilidades tecnol gicas que n s temos fica muito f cil e muito simples produzir de forma independente
6062958 n o adianta termos uma produ o boa e se n o h escoamento acredito sim que a lei possa significar um avan o no sentido de criar uma cultura da leitura n o s entre jovens mas entre a popula o em geral
6062959 infelizmente o brasil um pa s no qual as leis foram feitas para n o serem cumpridas

6062963 el t rmino no me gusta porque est muy relacionado con lo que son ciertos sectores

6062965 uni africa efuture is an exciting project to raise union visibility in their work to improve conditions amongst workers
6062966 at the moment only five per cent of our 146 affiliated unions are on line we want to raise that figure dramatically
6062967 we will be keeping in touch with experiences among these 16 unions and will then look to extend the project to more affiliates in more countries
6062968 the extra functions of the master token system control increase control for contactless applications and thus increase security in firms at the same time there are new possibilities and business processes for project partners and suppliers this development is a new step in terms of innovation for the legic technology platform and thus for our partners and users too in view of increased security and flexibility
6062969 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6062970 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6062971 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6062972 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency
6062973 further studies into the cellular and molecular processes leading to these changes could have implications for understanding and treating brain infections brain tumors and neurodegenerative disorders
6062974 astrocyte polarization as opposed to hypertrophy may be due to the fact that t cells engage in a very focused attack and the astrocytes respond in a directed polarized manner we know that the astrocytes respond in this polarized manner but we are continuing to investigate precisely why
6062975 we believe this is part of a defensive astrocyte response that may serve to destroy the attacking t cells
6062976 when a t cell recognizes an astrocyte infected with a virus or identified as a foreign cell it launches an attack in response the astrocyte polarizes toward the t cell and may actually end up engulfing the aggressor if so this could be a novel unique mechanism of defense by brain cells against immune cells
6062977 the lhc is a discovery machine we dont know what well find
6062978 im actually hoping we find something unexpected that does the job of the higgs
6062979 weve been debating this for 30 years and one way or another the lhc will definitively tell us how electroweak symmetry breaking occurs thats a fundamental advance
6062980 its a tough game you can only do it by statistical analysis since there are other known processes that produce events that can mimic a higgs boson signal
6062981 by itself the higgs is a very puzzling particle so there have been a lot of conjectures about some kind of new physics beyond the standard model supersymmetry has the easiest time fitting in with what we know
6062982 initially well be looking for things that are known standards to make sure that everything is working properly in 2009 we could start really looking for new things like supersymmetry
6062983 these large projects take such a long time we have to start early
6062984 weve been operating it and looking at cosmic ray particles
6062985 nature gives us these cosmic rays for free and theyre the same kinds of particles well see when the machine turns on so it enables us to check out certain aspects of the detector but were very excited to start seeing collisions from the machine
6062986 well be throwing away a lot of data so we have to make sure the triggers are working correctly
6062987 the graduate students and postdocs get to go to geneva but even the undergraduates get a chance to work in a real physics lab and be part of a major international experiment
6062988 there is a high level of interaction and camaraderie between theorists and experimentalists at ucsc which is not the case at other leading institutions
6062989 for me its valuable just in terms of being aware of whats happening on the experimental side
6062990 if nothing were found beyond what we know today that would be so radical because it would be in violation of a lot of extremely fundamental principles
6062991 problems with the use and sizing of graduated compression stockings are common throughout the country and this study is one of the first to systematically analyze the problems and recommend ways to improve practice
6062992 based on the study findings we recommend that knee length stockings be the standard length used and that the education of nurses and patients about the proper use of stockings be improved
6062993 a lot can be done to optimize the benefits of graduated compression stockings and minimize adverse effects
6062994 knee length stockings have many practical advantages over thigh length in that they lower the risk of problems and health care costs the improper use and sizing of these stockings and the deficiencies in patient education are important health care issues
6062995 in texas we have a long tradition of not talking about the number of cattle you own or your net worth
6062996 in my interpretation of the law you only have two choices you either disclose your assets if its in a regular trust or you have a blind trust
6062997 one day our generation is gonna rule the population so we keep on waiting waiting on the world to change
6062998 the first step in this process of mindful awareness is radical self acceptance
6062999 heres an example of someone who already had the 2 and 4 month shots but who now wants to switch at six months you would just get dtap and rota then at 7 months
6063000 the first step in this process of mindful awareness is radical self acceptance

6063007 this supplier park is not only modelled on the success of the local automotive industry but also mirrors similar international parks such as silicone valley in california and toulouse in france
6063008 we are currently looking into the use of passive energy and considering the options of conventional power provided by state utility eskom versus that of solar energy
6063009 we are also looking into the use of water reticulation versus that of natural water
6063010 the cav has been designed to unlock the growth potential of the local aerospace and aviation industries where local original equipment manufacturers suppliers of components parts and tools and service providers stand to benefit equally from synergistic and economy of scale applications
6063011 while the cav is important to us as a local industry it is interlinked to attracting original equipment manufacturers to south africa and will help us join the international market
6063012 the success of the cav is based on the commercial viability of the cluster to meet the demands of the international aerospace merket
6063013 we recognise the importance of efficient clusters of areas of competence that need to be developed and supported and ultimately integrated into the global aerospace industry
6063014 nosotros sostuvimos ese modelo pero ca mos en la trampa estaba todo calculado
6063015 the nation pays tribute to the memory of your 10 comrades
6063016 they fulfilled their duties to the fullest and it cost them their lives which reminds us that being a soldier is a job like no other
6063017 the cause is just it is an honor for france and its armies to defend them
6063018 reinforced with quick reaction forces close air support and mobile medical teams
6063019 the important first step for the international cricket council was gaining recognition of the sport and of the council from the ioc
6063020 that is important particularly for many of our smaller nations because to belong to a sporting body that has recognition from the ioc improves their opportunity for funding
6063021 it is something that cricket has to think about very carefully
6063022 this visit these few days give us the opportunity to assess the potential for cricket becoming an olympic sport
6063023 2020 must be the earliest realistic date but i must emphasise the international cricket council has to consider its position just as the ioc has to consider its position
6063024 cricketers wont care about the money the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
6063025 marching in an olympic games opening ceremony might give individual cricketers goosebumps
6063026 but as part of the evolution of the game it wouldnt raise a pimple on the backside
6063027 the idea is not to introduce new requirements but some clarifications will lead to certain changes in the way you do things
6063028 a vulnerability scan is more doable and less expensive than going through your source code
6063029 the standard has always recommended that wep not be used but now theyre putting in a timeline
6063030 we the g 7 stand ready to support georgia in order to promote the continued health of the georgian economy maintain confidence in georgias financial system and support economic reconstruction
6063031 this is the olympics this is a chance of a lifetime no way im missing this nuh uh
6063032 i feel like im part of a team thats passing the torch from the older players to the younger ones like candace
6063033 whatever minutes i get im happy to get them they brought me here for defense and thats what im going to provide
6063034 if you just cut through everything if i could give you one thing besides the generic intangible or energy its that she gets you extra possessions
6063035 whether its on the offensive glass or a steal or a deflection in athens she was a starter here shes a sixth man and there cant be a better sixth man anywhere
6063036 not really our team went to the great wall and i got out to the mall one day but for the most part im staying off my feet as much as possible
6063037 yeah i hear they have their own little american village in the hotel like their own little solar system
6063038 im not sure theyve experienced china yet i guess they want to be comfortable
6063039 weve just got to get back to our bread and butter and thats defense
6063040 thats been our teams driving force the last three seasons and weve gotten away from that
6063041 tom has been heavily recruited by many teams this season
6063042 his scoring skill speed and experience in not only the uhl and chl but also in the echl and wha2 made him a player that we all wanted im happy we were able to come to terms and look forward to having tom as a valued member of the renegades this season
6063043 he plays the power play and kills penalties and has a great touch with the puck we happy hes back
6063044 im confident he can compete very well in our league and be a key contributor for us tommy plays a north american style of game which will fit in nicely on our team

6063047 scenarios and solutions mapping the traps and sales effectiveness gaps
6063048 marketing and sales should not be struggling for common ground and engaging in a struggle for power
6063049 the functions should be tightly coupled to drive business performance and improve lead quality and conversion rates in fact there is an urgent need for marketing and sales to align and embrace technologies processes and programs that enable wider and deeper customer conversions
6063050 so do you expect for biden to tell the truth

6063057 there are a ton of texas bloggers but they dont ever seem to talk or know each other
6063058 it was one of the first lessons i had in that kind of cohesive spirit of the tennessee blogosphere
6063059 theres a sense that we all do this and we can have our fights and still stay kind of nice
6063060 fewer writers of real talent are being discovered fewer publishers are willing to take any sort of risk and serious literary minded reading that glorious pastime that fine personal art the immersive and transportive and beautiful intellectual fertilizer appears to be giving way to the more addictive but far less nourishing hellbeast of new media and the net

6063077 in place of a car park we will have londons best public swimming and indoor leisure centre the headquarters of rambert dance company with its three dance studios 329 new homes a town square linked to waterloo bridge possibly a new university faculty building and across one road the national theatre and across the other award winning housing co operatives this is community building with style
6063078 we are appalled to learn that the secretary of state has not only overturned the advice of english heritage as her expert advisors but she has also chosen to ignore the learned opinion of an independent inspector
6063079 english heritage finds it incomprehensible that her reason for doing so was because she considered that community benefits outweigh harm to the historic environment as though one must be at the sacrifice of the other
6063080 there are alternative options that would have provided the same community benefits but would have been more sensitive without causing serious damage to historic buildings spaces and views
6063081 obviously we do not consider this matter closed and we are considering our next steps and the options open to us
6063082 its very hard to take yourself too seriously when you look at the world from outer space
6063083 you say i started out with practically nothing but that isnt correct we all start with all there is its how we use it that makes things possible
6063084 we were backing all this up regularly using a tape library with eight lto tape drives
6063085 since we had the hardware we were asked to back up another groups new server which was beyond their capacity it was a windows file server with a large amount of direct attached storage and 1 gigabit network card
6063086 one day i just happened to be passing by when i overheard the head of the windows group talking to one of the windows systems administrators
6063087 they had connected a tape drive and installed their backup software

6063089 online auctioneer ebay inc said it will lower the fees it charges for products listed for sale at a fixed price in a bid to become more competitive with rival web sites such as amazon com inc ebay which sparked seller protests earlier this year when it raised fees for auction listings said it will reduce the fee for fixed price listings to 35 cents down from as much as 4 and increase the duration of a listing to 30 days from seven the company will simultaneously raise the commission it charges once the products are sold in effect taking on more responsibility to drive buyers to the site ebay declined to provide details of the commission increase both changes are effective sept 14 the company is playing catch up to other web sites that have focused on fixed price sales

6063091 no matter how much i like the new media i really value the reporting function and think its extremely important
6063092 were always looking to pick topics that we feel are really important and relevant and to present them in ways to help people think more deeply about the subject deeper than sound bite level

6063116 i remember the soldiers brought out all the pictures of nkrumah from the various government offices poured kerosene on them and set them ablaze i still remember that image the fire and the soldiers holding guns and forcing us to sing as a child i couldnt relate with it i became totally confused after that incident anytime i saw a soldier in uniform i got frightened
6063117 as a child i saw people fighting and i used to have nightmares about the violence and that affected my studies especially from primary one to three the violence occupied my thoughts any time i wanted to study as a result learning became difficult for me

6063140 if the voters register becomes an issue of contention among political parties the election results may be disputed leading to violence
6063141 it is instructive that nearly all stakeholders including ec itself agree that the exercise could have been better organized
6063142 this in the future will forestall the unpleasant episodes observed
6063143 codeo reports in 2000 and 2004 had strongly recommended that both the ncce and the ec must take voter civic education seriously especially during the election year but these were apparently ignored
6063144 codeo commends the political parties for their mass mobilization of potential registrants and their commitment to and vigilance over the entire exercise

6063147 america is being overrun by an invasion force from mexico
6063148 the party belongs to you and must serve you it is your sweat sacrifice and tenacity over the years that have built up this great party i therefore see my selection to support our presidential candidate as a call to serve you at all times and in all a circumstances
6063149 let me assure those who have in the true npp spirit of respect for free expression and dissent voiced concerns about my nomination that i am truly one of the family members i sincerely look forward to work with nana addo dankwa akufo addo the leadership and particularly with you the hard working foot soldiers of our party
6063150 i wish to make an open promise to you that my doors will be opened to each and every one of you and i look forward to developing personal friendships with as many of you as possible
6063151 i believe his selection is a clear indication of the fact that the political terrain of our country is gradually changing where successful professionals from other fields of endeavour must play active roles in the frontline towards the transformation of this country
6063152 even though i am disappointed i would still campaign and vote for the party in the general election
6063153 because we are not sympathisers of the ruling party on the other hand we would like to make history with our brother becoming the first mamprusi vice president in the country
6063154 indeed i must also commend the leadership of the two parties for selecting such brilliant citizens of the north who have so much to offer this country to partner their respective presidential candidates
6063155 we would like to express our appreciation to the national executive committee of the npp and nana addo for this opportunity and to assure them that we shall also do our best to improve on the partys fortunes in the region in the forthcoming elections
6063156 the eventual benefits that ghana can receive from its oil and gas resources depend in part on the fiscal regime that is in place
6063157 since february 2008 we have had the benefits of many experts on several aspects of the petroleum industry
6063158 our challenge rather is how to take these lessons and experiences and use them to develop the rules and guidelines that will do two things for us
6063159 i was originally born into a united party up family and my family has always belonged to the up tradition so when i left the ndc i went back to where i belong because even before i joined them i had established my life well and was not depending on anybody to take care of my children
6063160 i was into helping women and children defending their rights and my hosting
6063161 the trouble was too much so i left because i was not a bootlicker and i had a better life to live other than being abused in the ndc
6063162 my dear the ndc did not make me who i am it is true i had some political experience from them but before i joined the ndc i was a responsible woman who was doing very well
6063163 if anything at all i rather lost financially by joining the ndc i had to abandon my building for a long time because i was using the money to campaign and when i lost the election my brothers in the npp bought a coffin and paraded it through the town singing that i had fallen on my buttocks and they were going to bury me
6063164 i am not a useless woman as the ndc would want people to think i am a trained teacher and i have done well in the entertainment industry i have educated my children well and one of them at age 28 works with the world bank in washington i have a daughter pursuing her masters in medicine in california my twins are in holland and my last but one is in achimota college am i a useless person
6063165 that is ignorant talk because arnold schwarzenegger the california governor was an entertainer we use what we do to educate people and if people think that means i am useless well i leave them to their conscience to the public who see what we do and to god
6063166 the money has been paid and is now in government chest ready for disbursement
6063167 let everyone understand that in politics we have the conservatives and the progressives in the united kingdom we have the conservative party and the new labour of tony blair and gordon brown in the united states of america there is the republican party and the democratic party of bill clinton and barack obama
6063168 if the npp is more like the republicans the cpp is more like the democrats therefore mr akuffo addo is talking like mr mccain while i papa kwesi nduom am talking like barack obama
6063169 use governments purchasing power to ensure that we eat what we grow and use what we produce here in ghana
6063170 it is for this reason that i will challenge apostle safo the suame industrial centre and others to produce the official vehicle to be used by me as agenda to bridge the development gap between the north and the south
6063171 for everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to love and a time to hate a time for war and a time for peace
6063172 this is the time for the cpp to come to power once again and this is the time for the
6063173 that is the more reason why ges is encouraging empowering school management committees smcs and parent teacher associations ptas which are important agents of school supervision
6063174 it is not allowed for any policeman or woman to take food or even water from political parties during election times whoever is caught will face sanctions
6063175 once you are a policeman on duty you have to prepare adequately before leaving for your duty post but not to leave there to buy food or water or rely on anybody else for food
6063176 it is our duty to protect the people and their property and we cannot refuse any partys intention to hold any forum of any kind but all we need is that the parties should inform us in time so that we also can organise our men and women to provide them the needed protection
6063177 if by next year the situation has not improved and anyone goes to sea and gets a bowl full of fish i can assure you they did not come from the sea but dropped from heaven
6063178 this is our season where we are expected to catch a lot of herrings and other assorted fishes but the pair trawling by industrial vessel which fish all year round have resulted in low catch on our part
6063179 as a result when we return from fishing with our little catch which is fresh we do not get the price for it and we lose greatly because the people who buy the dead fish from the foreigners sell them at lower prices
6063180 what is happening now is different because we go and come back empty handed
6063181 i was not afraid to get up and address the state and tell people where the crisis was i didnt mind the criticism i didnt mind a couple million in commercials saying im cutting this and cutting that and injuring this one and injuring that one
6063182 a good ethical decision is a good political decision you may be bringing people bad news but they respect you because youre trying to do something about it
6063183 nobody said anything about it this year last year the year before
6063184 weve had other governors around here nobody seemed to recognize the problem there were signals that i got that i responded to as opposed to having to continue to borrow money and pretend there isnt a problem
6063185 i think this deficit is a lot greater than people have really computed
6063186 everybody in this state has to share everyone in a family should share responsibilty and the senior members of the family should take more responsibility
6063187 limit the way in which legislators are pressured hoodwinked and cajoled into doing things they know in their hearts arent the right things to do
6063188 oh heres a quarter that makes 80 more cents and i know i have some more change in my pocket just a sec

6063194 each year the number of people booking their summer holidays two months or more ahead of the departure date has grown following this trend weve seen an uptake in bookings for holidays in the caribbean and thailand along with other long haul destinations
6063195 this suggests to us that a lot more people are planning ahead and saving up for their holidays somewhere special
6063196 with the lousy weather here people cannot consider getting away from the sun despite the cost we all need cheering up so a holiday is a luxury that has become a necessity for many
6063197 you wouldnt play a college soccer game there not to mention a professional game
6063198 first for one game only the crew would make the field 62 yards wide
6063199 since theres a high school football game the night before they could just leave the lines on the grass and use the football field instead of the mls anthem they can play circus music as the teams walk onto the field during the game it will be non stop jock jams and public address announcements the scoreboard clock can count down and if they still have the thing the crew could even put that old shootout clock behind the north goal
6063200 the crew could put a large butter sculpture of bruce arena out on the plaza a butter bruce would be very good entertainment for middle america

6063229 our sense of value and self worth is often tied to how much money we make
6063230 there is an illusion that we live with and believe that a bigger paycheck makes us happier and more valuable

6063235 i realized the battle was already lost that we were deluding ourselves if we felt we could force this kid to do anything in school it was only a question of whether we were going to lose him as well
6063236 he wasnt like some belligerent sullen kid he was a great sunny guy who happened to hate high school he was ill served by going to school he likes to talk and he likes to watch movies so i thought lets give the guy something to do that gives him pleasure and see where he goes
6063237 i worried i was making use of him as an example of my own hipness
6063238 there was something that flattered my vanity about this decision to let him drop out of school and watch movies
6063239 if he hadnt done something like that he wouldnt have been my dad i think that three years we spent together formed me as a person
6063240 i dont think you necessarily learn life lessons from films i think the only life lessons you learn are from knocking yourself around and actually living but wed have conversations that sprang out of these films i did learn from that things guys need to talk about heartbreak and drugs and all that it happened to be movies but it could have been something else my dad and i did i think it was more about us spending time together
6063241 chaput is one of the most respected leaders of the catholic church in america
6063242 his record is a strong commitment to social and economic justice and the principles of the catholic faith hes also a strong patriot
6063243 pro life democrats who are proud catholics like myself feel this is an insult to our values the party should be aware there are strong pro life people who are politically successful
6063244 im happy to see they are having prayer at their sessions and they have a right to choose whom they want to do that
6063245 hopefully they will know being catholic is more foundational to their identity than anything else
6063246 render unto caesar serving the nation by living our catholic beliefs in political life
6063247 to convince people they should not be embarrassed at being catholic and not buy the supposedly american notion that people should shelve their faith when they enter the public square
6063248 i am tired of people telling religious folks to be quiet in the public square because of constitutional questions of separation of church and state
6063249 i hope this encourages people to become confident and active

6063252 something can usually be done for even the most intractable pain
6063253 at the moment getting to see pain specialists is too much of a lottery none of the people i met had been referred by their gp
6063254 the world congress on pain taking place in glasgow is very positive in itself but having nicola sturgeon recognise the need for change where chronic pain management is concerned is even better
6063255 relieving chronic pain may just be the most misunderstood concept in health care but with the support and understanding of scotlands health minister there may just be hope for chronic pain sufferers yet

6063265 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
6063266 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
6063267 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
6063268 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
6063269 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited at this news and went looking for film producer albert r cubby broccoli to tell him

6063278 i dont think you necessarily learn life lessons from films i think the only life lessons you learn are from knocking yourself around and actually living but wed have conversations that sprang out of these films i did learn from that things guys need to talk about heartbreak and drugs and all that it happened to be movies but it could have been something else my dad and i did i think it was more about us spending time together
6063279 she couldnt come up with eight time gold medal winner michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer

6063282 the situation in the region and saudi arabias political and financial support for the palestinian authority
6063283 our members are taking this action very reluctantly they care deeply about the vital services they provide and those who depend on them and we apologise for any disruption
6063284 however members feel they have no choice when the employers offer is effectively a pay cut
6063285 the issues are difficult and complex and need to be carefully thought through

6063320 the basic tool for the manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words if you can control the meaning of words you can control the people who must use the words

6063325 the false claims act imposes civil liability upon any person who
6063326 although the false claims act does not specifically address whether private parties may bring qui tam actions pro se we have previously suggested that they cannot albeit in dicta
6063327 a litigant cannot prosecute a qui tam action under the act pro se
6063328 in short while the false claims act permits relators to control the false claims act litigation the claim itself belongs to the united states
6063329 because relators lack a personal interest in false claims act qui tam actions we conclude that they are not entitled to proceed pro se

6063352 the lesson of the successful 2005 joint union campaign to defend existing public sector members pension age is that we are stronger when we take action together
6063353 the sector wide pay freeze has created the conditions for another co ordinated campaign including industrial action if necessary
6063354 to give full support to affiliated unions efforts to protect their members real and relative pay levels to oppose the governments two per cent pay target for public sector workers and to co ordinate a joint campaign of opposition at national and local levels to the governments unfair public sector pay limit including co ordinated joint industrial action

6063361 if glitter continues to refuse to leave he could be put in detention in bangkok and the conditions in prison here are not very good at all worse than in vietnam
6063362 thai immigration chiefs have told thai airways to deal with him they are talking to british authorities to try and get a deal to bring him back home
6063363 he has had access to british tv in his hotel and knows that if he does come back he might never be able to leave again
6063364 thai airlines are looking for someone who would take him at the moment but that is not an easy task
6063365 no one wants to inherit the problem that thailand has at the moment
6063366 it is a very unusual situation the thai government will have to order his expulsion and do have the power to expel him
6063367 we cant do anything to bring him back to the uk as he hasnt committed an offence in this country
6063368 i suspect he will end up back here because he is a uk citizen everyone else has the right to refuse him but we dont

6063419 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6063420 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6063421 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6063422 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6063423 senator obama will also make stops next week in several battleground states before arriving in denver
6063424 its our job to take the senators message the overall plan and determine how to best apply that to our states
6063425 on a day to day basis we are not only identifying opportunities with voters but we are also building a comprehensive overall plan that works across all departments whether its political communications fundraising or the e campaign
6063426 we think civilian labor force is more accurate because its a better reflection of hoosiers ability to find employment
6063427 it is my hope that one day hoosiers will stop hearing announcements like this but under a mitch daniels administration that doesnt seem possible
6063428 indianas economy is clearly struggling and hoosier families are hurting yet this administration keeps telling us all is well sadly kokomo joins a growing list of communities that have fallen victim to the bush daniels economy it is time for new leadership that will fight to grow our economy and protect good paying jobs all across our state
6063429 many hoosier families are suffering as mainstays in the rv industry continue to lay off workers
6063430 congressman souder and i have worked to provide these families with some relief by organizing worker transition workshops but federal funds are also needed to help these families get back on their feet i encourage the department of labor to approve our national emergency grant as soon as possible
6063431 i remain very concerned for the families of these communities who have been affected by cutbacks in the rv industry
6063432 these workers need timely and effective assistance in addition to the transition workshops that congressman donnelly and i held we are asking the department of labor to act quickly and approve the national emergency grant so that this community can continue to overcome the current challenges it faces
6063433 if tax levels and taxpayer responsibilities arent balanced to promote economic development companies may not choose to locate here or stay here
6063434 and no one wants to see hoosiers out of work or businesses going elsewhere weve taken the positive steps of eliminating the inventory tax and corporate gross receipts tax and making permanent the venture capital tax credit still we must build on these efforts in order to better compete for job expansion and relocation especially with the economy now tightening across the country
6063435 the mayor knows how greatly this affects our quality of life if we get into a situation where we are able to bring back eliminated programs this will be one of the first to come back some programs might be looked at individually
6063436 if the programs are important to the community people will step up and support them
6063437 has done an outstanding job acting as the citizen oversight for both the police and fire departments
6063438 we had a meeting in june and told department heads and elected officials we were looking at less revenues and we asked them to take their 2008 budgets and reduce them by 5 percent for next year some of them did reduce their budgets but a lot of them did not
6063439 is there any reason the city administration couldnt be involved in this
6063440 it would be nice since we were excluded from the last one that we could be involved in this one
6063441 its not an anti abortion issue for us it was a health issue in our community for us
6063442 were fueling these athletes and everything theyre doing were having a part in
6063443 thats something were very proud of the olympics are going on and im one of the guys making it happen
6063444 there was one american runner erin donohue who went to unc chapel hill and right before the opening ceremony myself and an irish chef i was working with saw her in her usa outfit
6063445 so i yelled team usa how are you doing and we kind of struck up a conversation she was very down to earth very cordial
6063446 it was a three month commitment and i thought it sounded pretty interesting
6063447 so i went through the interview process and was recommended by a couple of my superiors and to be one of just a couple of hundred selected i felt very fortunate i feel very humbled
6063448 thats been one of the most fun parts for me sharing with them all these different influences whether they be italian or mexican or cajun or creole
6063449 its a monumental task but its a rewarding one and i dont care how good of a chef you are you dont know everything you can always learn from somebody so its kind of a nice recharge tool for us to learn from each other
6063450 its not as sweet not as many fried dishes and you dont see a lot of those thick syrupy sauces
6063451 on the whole its spicier they use a lot of very fresh products
6063452 they have jasmine rice which is kind of a fruity smelling rice there are a lot of dishes with mushrooms a lot of bamboo products lotus root is also a popular item it looks almost like a sweet potato but with a hollow almost spongy center its a unique turnip like vegetable
6063453 they have some pretty bizarre things like sea horses grasshoppers starfish scorpions
6063454 the scorpions arent too bad they marinate them in a szechuan bean paste theyre kind of nutty
6063455 in the last three weeks the legislature has shown a metamorphosis

6063475 bahwasanya dikatakan allah enggan dengan taubat setiap pelaku bidah dan tidaklah berpindah pelaku bidah kecuali kepada bidah yang lebih jelek
6063476 tidaklah seseorang berada di atas suatu pendapat dari kebidahan kemudian meninggalkannya kecuali berpindah kepada yang lebih jelek dari itu
6063477 aku mendengar abdullah ibnul qasim berkata tidaklah seorang hamba berada di atas al hawa kemudian meninggalkannya kecuali berpindah kepada sesuatu yang lebih jelek daripadanya
6063478 jika seorang pelaku bidah keluar darinya ruju maka sesungguhnya dia keluar kepada yang lebih jelek daripadanya sebagaimana dalam hadits ayyub atau dia termasuk yang menampakkan seakan akan rujuk padahal setelah itu dia tetap berada di atas kebidahan tersebut seperti kisah ghailan bersama umar bin abdul aziz
6063479 ada seseorang berpendapat dengan suatu pendapat yang bidah pent kemudian rujuk maka aku mendatangi muhammad dengan gembira karena itu untuk mengabarkan kepadanya aku mengatakan tidakkah engkau merasa senang bahwa si fulan telah meninggalkan pendapatnya yang pernah diucapkannya maka dia berpendapat lihatlah ke mana dia berpindah sesungguhnya akhir hadits lebih dahsyat dari awal hadits atas mereka mereka keluar dari dien kemudian tidak akan kembali kepadanya
6063480 diriwayatkan oleh amru bin muhajir sampai berita kepada umar bin abdul aziz bahwa ghailan al qadari berbicara tentang taqdir maka beliau mengutus seseorang kepadanya dan memenjarakannya beberapa hari kemudian dia dihadapkan kepada umar bin abdul aziz dan beliau berkata berita apa yang sampai kepadaku ini tentangmu berkata amir bin muhajir periwayat aku isyaratkan kepadanya agar tidak berbicara sesuatupun tetapi dia ghalian berkata ya wahai amirul mukminin sesungguhnya allah azza wa jalla berfirman bukankah telah datang atas manusia suatu waktu dari masa sedangkan dia ketika itu belum merupakan sesuatu yang dapat disebut sesungguhnya kami telah menciptakan manusia dari setetes mani yang bercampur yang kami hendak mengujinya oleh karena itu kami menjadikan dia mendengar dan melihat sesungguhnya kami telah menunjukinya kepada jalan itu ada yang bersyukur adapula yang kufur maksudnya dia menolak taqdir dengan ayat ini pent maka berkatalah umar bin abdul aziz bacalah sampai akhir surat dan tidaklah kalian berkehendak menempuh jalan itu kecuali bila dikehendaki allah sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui lagi maha bijaksana dia memasukkan siapa yang dikehendaki nya ke dalam rahmat nya dan bagi orang orang yang dhalim disediakan adzab yang pedih kemudian berkata apa yang akan kamu katakan wahai ghailan dia menjawab aku katakan aku dahulu buta dan engkau telah membuat aku melihat aku dahulu tuli dan engkau telah membuat aku mendengar dan aku dulunya sesat dan engkau telah menunjukiku maka berkatalah umar rahimahullah ya allah jika benar hamba mu ghailan jujur kalau tidak saliblah dia setelah itu ghailan berhenti dari ucapannya tentang taqdir hingga meninggallah umar bin abdul aziz rahimahullah kemudian khilafah berpindah ke tangan hisyam rahimahullah maka mulailah ghailan berbicara tentang taqdir kemudian hisyam mengutus seseorang kepadanya dan memotong tangannya ketika itu lewatlah seseorang sedangkan lalat hinggap di tangan ghailan maka berkatalah dia wahai ghailan ini adalah qadla dan qadhar takdir dia berkata engkau berdusta demi allah ini bukanlah qadla dan qadar ketika hisyam mendengarnya dia mengutus kembali utusannya dan menyalibnya
6063481 kalimat emas ini telah shahih riwayatnya dari shahabat tidak hanya seorang seperti diantaranya abu darda dan abdullah bin masud radhiallahu anhuma sebagaimana dalam kitab syarah ushul itiqad ahlus sunnah wal jamaah hal 114 115 kitab as sunnah oleh ibnu nashr hal 27 28 dan kitab al ibanah oleh ibnu baththah 1 320 dan lain lain
6063482 yang menciptakan mati dan hidup untuk menguji kalian siapa yang terbaik amalannya
6063483 yang paling baik amalnya adalah yang paling ikhlas dan paling benar cocok dengan sunnah pent
6063484 sesungguhnya sederhana di atas jalan dan sunnah lebih baik daripada bersungguh sungguh dalam menyelisihi jalan dan sunnah maka lihatlah jika amal kalian sederhana atau sungguh sungguh hendaklah berada di atas manhaj para nabi dan sunnah mereka shalallahu alaihi wa sallam
6063485 akan muncul setelahku para pemimpin yang tidak mengambil petunjuk dari petunjukku amp tidak mengikuti sunnahku dan akan tegak diantara mereka orang2 yg hatinya adalah hati syaitan dalam jasad manusia
6063486 apa yg akan aku lakukan wahai rasulullah jika aku menemukan yang demikian
6063487 engkau mendengar amp taat kepada pemimpin walaupun dia memukul punggungmu amp mengambil hartamu maka dengar dan taatlah
6063488 muhammad bin abdul wahhab telah menampakkan semangat thalabul ilmi nya sejak usia belia
6063489 sesungguhnya dia muhammad bin abdul wahab memiliki pemahaman yang bagus kalau seandainya dia belajar selama satu tahun niscaya dia akan hafal mapan serta menguasai apa yang dia pelajari aku tahu bahwasanya dia telah ihtilam baligh pada usia dua belas tahun dan aku melihatnya sudah pantas untuk menjadi imam maka aku jadikan dia sebagai imam shalat berjamaah dikarenakan marifah dan ilmunya tentang ahkam dan pada usia balighnya itulah aku nikahkan dia kemudian setelah nikah dia meminta izin kepadaku untuk berhaji maka aku penuhi permintaannya dan aku berikan segala bantuan demi tercapai tujuannya tersebut lalu berangkatlah dia menunaikan ibadah haji salah satu rukun dari rukun rukun islam
6063490 tegakkanlah dakwah di jalan allah dan kami senantiasa akan membantumu
6063491 wahai amir utsman bin muhammad bin mamar izinkanlah saya untuk menghancurkan kubah zaid bin khathab karena sungguh kubah tersebut dibangun dalam rangka menentang syariat allah subhanahu wa taala dan allah taala tidak akan ridha selama lamanya dengan amalan tersebut rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pun telah melarang dijadikannya kuburan sebagai masjid kubah zaid ini telah menjadi fitnah bagi manusia dan merubah aqidah mereka oleh karena itu wajib bagi kita untuk menghancurkannya
6063492 wahai syaikh sesungguhnya amir al ahsaa telah menulis surat kepadaku begini dan begini dia menginginkan agar kami membunuhmu kami tidak ingin untuk membunuhmu dan kami pun tidak berani dengan dia tiada daya dan upaya pada kami untuk menentangnya oleh karena itu kami berul betul mengharap syaikh agar sudi meninggalkan negeri uyainah ini
6063493 wahai amir sesungguhnya apa yang aku dakwahkan ini adalah agama allah dan realisasi kalimat la ilaaha illallah muhammadur rasulullah maka barangsiapa yang berpegang teguh dengan agama ini serta menegakkannya di bumi allah ini niscaya allah subhanahu wa taala akan menolongnya dan memberinya kekuatan serta menjadikan dia sebagai penguasa di negeri para musuhnya jika engkai bersabar dan beristiqamah serta mau menerima ajaran ini niscaya allah subhanahu wa taala akan menolongmu menjagamu dari amir al ahsaa dan yang lainnya dari musuh musuhmu serta allah taala akan menjadikanmu sebagai penguasa atas negerinya dan keluarganya
6063494 wahai syaikh sesungguhnya kami tiada daya dan upaya untuk memeranginya dan kami tiada mempunyai kesabaran untuk menentangnya

6063508 monica is just hot plain and simple she is the perfect addition to blazingbucks and her fan base follows her everywhere we are happy she is with us and we are promoting monica heavily and the results have been stellar
6063509 what obama represents is we as a people are a part of the american dream
6063510 the message is for a kid from in marcy projects right now to say maybe i can be the president
6063511 not just for us blacks but also with all americans i think theres so much our president can do obama seems like a human being i say that because a lot of presidents dont seem like human beings they seem like straight up businessmen who care about nothing but the business
6063512 were a small part of it but were showing our support to show that we are aware of whats going on and where its going
6063513 we really want change we really need it its not the same no more
6063514 listen to what hes saying hes saying what i wanna hear just like my favorite rapper if an mc is saying what i wanna hear imma go buy his album if a candidate is saying what i wanna hear imma go vote for him i can vote by the way watch me im going to register to vote
6063515 i think the first thing the hip hop community has to do is let the man become president
6063516 they gotta work in other ways to get him in the white house its not really about doing a song right now he has to separate himself from that stuff hes in a political race everybody should kick back for a minute see what happens in november if he becomes president he wouldnt have to separate himself as much from some of these statements because obama cant come as hard core as ludacris as far as his message right now he cant do that us rappers might have to hold our tongues for a few months
6063517 all it takes is for a mutha er getting out there being real ghetto and people will be like we dont wanna f with obama theyll wanna smash on him because of what somebody else said someone speaks for himself and its baracks fault what did luda say thats baracks fault is it baracks fault what im saying i dont wanna be the reason he dont get the presidency
6063518 the most problematic hip hop gets 90 percent of the coverage in the non music press
6063519 hip hop is associated in so many peoples minds with crime drugs and misogyny so obamas faced with a constellation of problematic images the question is how do you send a message that doesnt wind up demonizing somebody
6063520 its cool to make a couple comments but be careful about what you say because theyre gonna try to pin it towards him
6063521 we know its so much tension around politics right now theyre trying to take him down maybe everybody needs to chill out a little bit im not sure how much barack mixtapes are helping him i dont think no person is doing a mixtape addressing baracks political views
6063522 i dont think luda or anybody ever thought it would be that big i heard the freestyle the minute it came out and in his defense thats what people do on the mixtape circuit ive put out multiple mixtapes where i might not actually feel a certain way about somebody but ill say a punch line to give them that shock value its nothing new to the mixtape circuit i dont think he really wants mccain in a wheelchair the lyric reads mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed its just a freestyle thing it was crazy they took it that big
6063523 during this election young people from all walks of life have responded to senator obamas message of hope and change for the future with great enthusiasm
6063524 and that includes those in the hip hop community individuals who are talented intelligent and entrepreneurial in spirit but who in the past have felt that government and politics dont really work for them
6063525 senator obama wants to engage the hip hop community more in the political process because issues including education jobs and health care are as important to this generation as any other we will be talking to the hip hop community more throughout this campaign and letting them know they have reason to put their trust in senator obama because he will work to fundamentally change their lives
6063526 the hip hop experience is for some the black experience and the campaign has been very inclusive and has been one that has welcomed voices from all over the country
6063527 with the hip hop community its been an interesting conversation because on the one hand we know the hip hop community has reflected a great deal of whats been happening in our inner cities for a long time and the systemic challenges that face that community senator obama has a plan as part of his overall call for change that will address those challenges the voice of the hip hop community will be reflected in this campaign with senator obamas plan for inner city communities
6063528 these situations are a case by case basis when and where and timing
6063529 the hip hop community has clearly embraced senator obama and they see him as someone who can effect change in a dramatic way the key with us as we go through the next few months is identifying opportunities where we can work together to communicate the senators message
6063530 i thought about hip hop associations harming obamas chances i really did
6063531 so in the concert i always say this is not sponsored by obama i make it very clear to say that cause i know obama associated with this guy from f in marcy projects i know thats coming any day i think about that often i mean what do you do what do i do i have to support the guy but i dont wanna hurt him i aint like the preachers and all those guys i dont wanna make the inappropriate statements and keep going im the guy that will fall back
6063532 you gotta speak what you feel you gotta be respectful though
6063533 like anything you do you cant come to anybodys show and be disrespectful if youre supporting them so you dont speak on nobody and act a fool
6063534 in some ways you have to assume most of the hip hop community will be behind him because they dont have a choice because their vote aint going to mccain
6063535 but if he uses this kind of secret code the dirt off the shoulder saying you and i both know it but i cant afford to say so it could work for him
6063536 rappers have to realize that supporting obama publicly is like a corporate meeting come support us but dress for the occasion
6063537 its hard you wanna see him be a part of it more but you know the powers that be are going to make it such a big deal theyll be like obama was with dude who was smoking weed i would love to see obama go on
6063538 if a king goes out and fights wars with his people his people will do anything for him
6063539 if youre just a king in your castle and you calling shots then the respect from the people will never be there we dont see our leaders with us in our situations on a heavy heavy level
6063540 a lot of people may not feel me on this but you gotta feel me if you real im not voting for obama
6063541 i dont like obama obama is a traitor he turned his back on everybody he turned his back on reverend jeremiah wright reverend wright has been with him since the beginning ludacris has done stuff in his support he speaks the truth but obama feels that a certain demographic may not vote for him because of it so he turns his back on luda bernie mac he invited bernie mac to come in and do his roast or whatever it was called bernie mac said some things that were offensive thats what bernie mac is known for what does he do turn his back on bernie mac whos he gonna denounce next im not even voting this year if i did vote it would be for mccain i like to know the enemy barack i dont know
6063542 having a young person like obama run for president has inspired many in the hip hop community
6063543 but hes running for president so hes not going to endorse any one genre of music or any one aspect of a cultural phenomenon like hip hop because hes going to be the president of
6063544 an agreement in principle has been reached between om and sunderland for the loan of djibril cisse to the english club until the end of the season
6063545 some details still need to be sorted out ahead of the confirmation of the loan
6063546 i dont think i am beautiful i can look good and i can look ugly whats funny is that when i was younger i wanted everyone to look at me now i like to watch other people because you can learn a lot of interesting things
6063547 sometimes we dont think were as beautiful as we truly are

6063564 technology has changed rapidly we know that social conditions in singapore have changed and people want greater space for expression so the current laws that govern political discourse online are dated and they need to be updated so thats one part
6063565 the more problematic part is how do we in the process of opening up come up with some ways of reducing minimising if not cut it off completely this abuse of this technology
6063566 if our proposals are accepted i think itll be quite a major step in terms of opening up the space for political participation we have spent an awful lot of time working on this we are reasonably pleased with what weve done but we dont have a monopoly
6063567 i hope the general public will step forward and robustly scrutinise what we are suggesting and find ways to help us improve on our ideas this cannot be the final chapter of the saga i think there would probably be a need to further review whatever changes that are made a few years down the road
6063568 they want to know the original position but they also may want to know the alternative views and the speculative positions in singapore its important that we maintain a direct line of communication between government and the people and the traditional media plays a very important role in doing that
6063569 good very good we deserved to be in the final

6063575 peter has made a wonderful contribution in both the financial and strategic directions of qantas over the past eight years and has served the company and shareholders with distinction
6063576 it has been a privilege to have contributed to the management and strategic development of this great company with a new incoming ceo i believe that signalling now my intention to step down from both my executive and non executive roles is in the best interests of shareholders and the company
6063577 marmayogi is a high cost high value project of our time we would not specify the exact cost of production at this point a formal agreement has been signed between the parties and a detailed planning for the project is going on at frantic phase the project will be a land mark project in the technical as well as cinematic qualities and would try to project indian cinema internationally in the best possible manner
6063578 in recent times a lot has been written about my film
6063579 however we dont have any affair going on between us sometimes journalism goes beyond my tolerance level this is one such occasion
6063580 everybody felt it was too lengthy in the first half particularly a song and some comedy scenes involving nayantara and senthil so we decided to shorten it i think the film is now more cute and crisp
6063581 it is more stocks specific market and there is clear lack of volumes as pointed out on the show and it indicates that nothing significant which might happen over the next few weeks or if you talk about 15 20 days or probably a month or so so i think it will be a lot more stocks specific market and there is some interesting things happening in the pharma sector if you see in stocks like sun pharma glenmark and lupin trade very close to their 52 weeks highs and that is why i think some action can happen
6063582 capital goods is another sector which we like a lot infact the chart patterns suggest that it will be a good strategy to buy stocks like bhel larsen amp toubro and crompton greaves on dips i think these are two sectors or probably couple of few stocks where we can find some kind of interesting patterns on the charts
6063583 india is very likely to get the exemption at the nsg that its seeking there is some scepticism new zealand ireland is frequently named the netherlands has come up before they are all sceptical and worried about the implications of the deal but when push comes to shove they are very unlikely to vote against the deal
6063584 the circumstances are quite favourable for this to go through its mostly a matter of implementation whether this goes through before bush leaves office is mostly a technical issue but im very optimistic that this will happen
6063585 i think its more likely that they will raise questions about this deal and ask for those questions to be adequately answered before they are willing to go along with the deal so in their minds it wouldnt be stopping it it would be simply seeking additional information
6063586 the jetflash v95 is an innovative marriage of fashion and technology that not only offers elegant distinctive styling and ultra portable convenience but also performs brilliantly as an advanced storage device
6063587 i feel negativity is not to be paid attention to
6063588 unless its something that happened with chris when it gets that serious its time to speak out
6063589 really my thing is i talked to the cats and its sad what people will do when theyre in the position of dont have
6063590 people will say omarion is still out there and in the pubic
6063591 i used to rock with them dudes and now when i see them its not like that
6063592 its gotta be like i look at you funny or you look at me funny if somebody has done something to disrespect you as a man i feel like i have to protect myself so now when i see them after everything that happened how do i be nice how do i be cool im a spiritual dude and a part of me is forgiving but there is so much that has been done you get tired of that this whole next album youll see a whole new omarion
6063593 a release is different from a drop when an artist is dropped usually they havent brought any revenue to the company as you know ive been with that company for a long time roughly over six years throughout b2k and my solo albums revenue was still brought in an artist like me could never get dropped how did i get dropped and i still ended up in a great situation usually when you hear drop it means oh hes over its a wrap its unfortunate that stuff like that gets put out there everybody likes to associate especially me being such a cool dude with negative things are you kidding me
6063594 hes a great producer and hes really at the top of his game right now
6063595 i cant ask for a better person to guide me we did ice box it wasnt enough for us to really build a solid relationship but ive got to spend time with him and we have a strong relationship its the biggest blessing that has happened to me musically
6063596 were just picking each others brains to see what can be done differently
6063597 my energetic style and aggressiveness when i perform i dont think thats necessarily been captured for the length of an album i always felt like i had joints like where its upbeat but it hasnt been captured in an album all these crazy new dances all these different things i wanna do when i look at my peers in the game they capture the true essence of who they are i kinda felt like throughout my career i had just blots of that

6063599 advice from a paediatrician re milk juice fruit and veg
6063600 ill think about it when im older and closer to death
6063601 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
6063602 in the last days god says i will pour out my spirit on all flesh
6063603 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6063604 surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me
6063605 i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth
6063606 despite popular knowledge of adverse effects the non vegetarian diet became increasingly widespread among hindus after the two major invasions by foreign powers first the muslims and later the british
6063607 that vegetarianism has always been widespread in india is clear from the earliest vedic texts this was observed by the ancient traveler megasthenes and also by fa hsien a chinese buddhist monk who in the fifth century traveled to india in order to obtain authentic copies of the scriptures
6063608 similarly the manusmriti declares that one should refrain from eating all kinds of meat for such eating involves killing and leads to karmic bondage bandha 5
6063609 o vegetable be succulent wholesome strengthening and thus body be fully grown
6063610 do not injure the beings living on the earth in the air and in the water
6063611 when a man realizes that meat is the butchered flesh of another creature he must abstain from eating it
6063612 having well considered the origin of flesh and the cruelty of fettering and slaying of corporeal beings let one entirely abstain from eating flesh
6063613 the ignoble ones who eat flesh deaths agents bind them fast and push them quick into the fiery jaws of hell naraka lower consciousness

6063617 we cringe everything we need to install a new release of the software

6063619 for i know the plans i have for you saith the lord plans to prosper you and not harm you to give you a future and a hope
6063620 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly of heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
6063621 cast thy burdens upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved
6063622 i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not slumber behold he that keepeth israel shall neither slumber or sleep the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night the lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy soul the lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even for evermore
6063623 fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay
6063624 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths
6063625 really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later
6063626 we found no overall increased risk of brain tumors among cellular phone users the potential elevated risk of brain tumors after long term cellular phone use awaits confirmation by future studies
6063627 if there is a risk from these products and at this point we do not know that there is it is probably very small
6063628 growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
6063629 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
6063630 the question is do you want to play russian roulette with your brain
6063631 i dont know that cell phones are dangerous but i dont know that they are safe
6063632 the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users
6063633 we certainly dont know of any mechanism by which radiofrequency exposure would cause a cancerous effect in cells we just dont know this might possibly occur
6063634 by all means if a person feels compelled that they should take precautions in reducing the amount of electromagnetic radio waves through their bodies by all means they should do so
6063635 but at the same time we have to remember theres no conclusive evidence that links cell phones to cancer whether its brain tumors or other forms of cancer
6063636 when you look at the overwhelming majority of studies that have been peer reviewed and published in scientific journals around the world youll find no relationship between wireless usage and adverse health affects
6063637 i dont want to get it brain cancer and i certainly dont want you to get it
6063638 ok i guess that has milk in it we dont want him to get sick
6063639 maybe i can get someone else to ride my horse so that he can get some exercise
6063640 but i decided that would not be fair to the people here
6063641 used the footage of tskhinvali which was literally ruined as a result of georgias attacks to make reports about the situation in the town of gori which the russian aviation supposedly bombed
6063642 what became the picture that mike jeremy of itn pegged one of the key images of the war in the former yugoslavia qtd in deichmann p 170 was in fact presented as to the western world as something it was not a concentration camp the focus was on fikret alic whos protruding rib cage behind a fence conjured up images of nazi death camps this death camp was a crude sick lie and fikret alic who survived the war was disturbed about the use of his image
6063643 sierra ambra is an arab and sierra an anglo arab liam loves the horses and really gets a kick out of stroking their necks and faces his mummy is hoping hell turn out to be a real little cowboy when hes older i so look forward to teaching him to ride

6063751 nawaz sharif and asif ali zardari are likely to delink the issue of kashmir from indo pakistan relations
6063752 president musharraf was a naive leader his war on terror was completely deceptive he brought in far more extremism into the world more instability in pakistan by manipulating his position and by double dealing with the jihadis
6063753 his work speaks for himself america gave just 1million when there was democracy in pakistan but after 9 11 till 2006 11 billion was given to fight terrorism its obvious the money has not been used as intended you cant fight a counter insurgency operation with f 16s it was the naivety of the us state department and pentagon to think that pakistani military is a cohesive force which will win their war on terrorism
6063754 despite spending 11 billion during musharrafs regime terrorism has increased radical forces have multiplied and more than 13 000 madrasas have sprung up in pakistan and terrorism in the region has also increased
6063755 i am not clear how much leverage the new democratic forces will have over the inter services intelligence and control over the countrys nuclear infrastructure pakistans military is waiting to understand the current process it is highly desirable that the civilian leadership should take control of it
6063756 we will have to wait and see how these two leaders sort out the issues
6063757 zardari has even impressed sharif i hope both of them will now settle down to do real business for pakistan
6063758 america should work with the democratic forces of pakistan the civilian leadership in pakistan should in their own way take their own counter insurgency measures negotiations with the tribal leaders and not a military solution will work here this is not time to destablise pakistan further

6063777 the tyre brand scorecard outlines that consumers are highly active in sharing feedback on tyres in an online social community the most active responses are from those either very happy or very unhappy with their tyre purchases and this mirrors peoples loyalty patterns increasingly people are prepared to shift brands based on what other consumers are sharing in online communities
6063778 an interesting outcome of the report details that while consumers are on the whole are happy with their current tyres they dont necessarily choose the same brand when replacing them consumers typically have been more aware of tyre brands but courtesy of internet based research and independent information are now able to identify specific details about tread patterns and why certain tread patterns are more suitable for tyre retailers this means that there is more opportunity to integrate internet based marketing information with appropriate point of sale information
6063779 the internet is growing in its popularity in educating consumers and subsequently people are seeking better information from tyre manufacturers when it matters most at point of sale traditional advertising needs to be combined with marketing that focuses on product differentiation general tyre education and safety programs with retail environments that improve the sales experience for that particular brand tyre manufacturers that now cater for both female and male purchasing habits in the new online space and traditional retail channel are going to benefit the most the game certainly has changed

6063854 vivimos en una sociedad patriarcal y en pol tica a las mujeres todav a se nos juzga con un baremo distinto al de los hombres
6063855 un s ntoma de que se trata a las mujeres como invitadas toleradas en el espacio p blico y no como ciudadanas de pleno derecho
6063856 una forma de intentar restar autoridad podr a querer decir que hay una mayor proximidad pero resulta un poco sospechoso porque no se hace con los hombres
6063857 las parlamentarias padecemos el mismo sexismo que muchas otras mujeres sin embargo es cierto que estamos en mejores condiciones estamos aqu para conseguir que todas las mujeres consigan cotas de igualdad
6063858 el sexismo se usa para poner a las mujeres en inferioridad de condiciones cuanta m s competencia hay y en la pol tica y en el mundo de la empresa la hay y mucha m s se utiliza para se alar una debilidad para menospreciar y minusvalorar
6063859 la mirada que se dirige a las mujeres pol ticas no es la misma con que se observa a los hombres las expresiones tampoco son las mismas no hay comentarios sobre c mo visten los hombres o como se peinan
6063860 un reflejo de que todav a existe un ramalazo de sexismo

6063863 se ora ministra a usted que le gustan tanto las declaraciones intempestivas y las sesiones fotogr ficas a usted que como dec a ayer mismo no s lo nos obliga a aguantarnos a ver sus fotos en el vogue sino incluso a verla luciendo unos vaqueros y una camisa muy mona

6063867 por qu tienen que preguntarle estas cosas nadie habla sobre si costa est casado o de si lo est manuel pizarro
6063868 a la vicepresidenta siempre se le ha mirado con lupa a solbes no se le ha cuestionado si est gordo delgado o normal
6063869 hay varones que se cuidan much simo y sin embargo no despiertan los comentarios que se hacen de las mujeres a quienes se atribuye ese cuidado como un d ficit de su capacidad
6063870 el machismo est muy en el fondo de las personas las cosas han cambiado y hay personas que tienen autocontrol otros no
6063871 el hecho de ser ambiciosa por ejemplo se utiliza como negativo cuando se habla de una mujer
6063872 una mujer ambiciosa parece que es algo negativo pero tener ambiciones en la vida no es nada malo
6063873 la labor pol tica de una mujer se observa desde otra perspectiva
6063874 hay una doble vara de medir un cuestionamiento de por qu estamos aqu

6063934 heres you pink slip on december 20th an early christmas present
6063935 experience shows me again and again that agility is not about working fast but about finding elegantly simple solutions to business problems youll know youve found an elegantly simple solution when the business people agree it solves their most important and immediate problems and when the developers know the solution can be built and tested in 30 days or less unless you find a solution that meets these two criteria its not possible to be agile and often because people cant find these simple solutions they mistakenly claim that agility itself doesnt work they come to this conclusion because they attempt to be agile by cramming complex solutions into short development cycles through working harder longer and faster that attempt has as much chance of success as trying to cram ten pounds of you know what into a five pound bag inevitably the bag breaks and then there is a mess to clean up an elegantly simple solution a robust 80 solution doesnt do everything there isnt time for that just the most important things finding this solution is not easy its the creative part it requires business people to figure out what tasks out of all the tasks they perform are the most important ones and what system features they need to handle those tasks then developers have to figure out how to build and test a system to deliver those features in the short amount of time available

6063939 rebounding identities the politics of identity in russia and ukraine
6063940 do you think that the people of eastern ukraine would be as easy with an eu accession as the people in kiev or lemberg
6063941 we have been behind a curtain of one sort or another for a long time we just want to join the rest of the world
6063942 this is different with the eu from galicia to the donez basin there is unity about the goal of accession the steel works barons of donezk are looking for european markets the traditionalist from lviv are longing for the return to the occident and different to nato nobody could politically misuse the approach even moscow would be satisfied by the way ukraine would bring quite some things into the eu an economy that recently has been growing 7 5 per year in average future resources like coal and steal as well as immeasurable distances of fertile farmland because of it its geographical position the country could build a strategic bridge to the energy reserves of central asia and it has definitely chosen the western way despite its chaotic laddishness the young ukranian democracy is vital and free of violence nevertheless an accession would still be problematic ukraine is a huge country split by cultural tensions and with a deadbeat infrastructure massive corruption and an operetta like quarrelling political class even the imagination to integrate the huge farmlands into the european agricultural policy is a nightmare the eu herself is struggling with its reform pains citizens are expressing their globalised fears and alienation in angry referenda and the elites do not show much affection to get even more problems on board yet what is clear in the end is that there is almost no other possibility than to lead ukraine at the border to accession into the union the country is not like switzerland that you can leave on its own in the valleys of the alps it is the object of external demands that have already shown their destructive effects in the neighbourhood and also within the ukraine there are endeavours to appeal to the internal frictions the choice in kiev is not europe or neutrality but europe or a situation like on the balkans if the democratic ukraine will not become a success story with european support it could one day become a hot spot due to internal tensions and external manipulation the european perspective for kiev is thus by far not the worst of all alternatives
6063943 vladimir putin told spanish journalists that if ukraine is accepted to the eu as it desires russia will be happy
6063944 indeed russia and ukraine have close relations in economy and cooperate in the industrial sphere so incorporation of the ukrainian economy into the eu economy is likely to have a positive result for russia as well
6063945 only 12 percent of businesses take technology seriously enough to operate full board level oversight of their it resources boards still appear to be lagging badly in implementing appropriate it governance measures it governance frameworks such as iso27001 also appear to be used in less than 50 percent of organisations
6063946 interaction between logic driven it personnel and managers who deal mostly in gray areas can be exasperating for both sides too often the result is a minimization of such interactions leaving the it team feeling misunderstood unappreciated and isolated unfortunately the chief information officer often reinforces this separation thats because he or she usually is an it professional chosen to be a director of technology rather than an executive who is expected to fully integrate it into the company
6063947 it people use jargon and acronyms that are indecipherable to others
6063948 applying it to business needs especially when a company is innovating is still an experimental process with few standards technology changes rapidly and is subject to fads which can be confusing even to it professionals
6063949 it departments in fortune 1000 enterprises actually are more productive and effective service providers than mid market counterparts and it has nothing to do with the amount of staffers or money spent
6063950 didnt take the time to consider the ramifications of making a change to the infrastructure
6063951 mid market it organizations only about one third as effective as their larger fortune 1000 cousins
6063952 it is too busy to adopt huge process oriented frameworks like itil six sigma cobit or formal it project management
6063953 but the reason they are so busy is precisely because they have no formal processes average it organization is its own worst customer and responsible for most of the outages to which it finds itself reacting
6063954 in fact most of the work going on in the average it organization is not productive work at all but rather is re work
6063955 the productivity gap between mid market and large it shops
6063956 the awards committee recognized seamans work to reflect excellent scholarship and high social relevance and noted that his commitment to the issue of college drinking was enduring and impressive
6063957 thanks scott judges im flattered but frankly astonished that a group of data driven knowledgeable scientists would actually be enlightened by the musings of a journalist who wandered into the thick of american campus life with a notebook in his hand makes me think i must have gotten at least part of it right everyone here tonight can agree that we have an alcohol problem increasingly centered among young people in this country where we might differ is on how best to respond i believe that we cannot expect young people to learn how to handle alcohol responsibly if we walk out of the room and assume that the law is going to solve the problem we need to be in that room demonstrating that one doesnt need to do shots and get falling down drink to enjoy oneself i would urge you as scientists to help us as a society find the right balance between legislating behavior as we try to do now and educating young people objectively so they can take responsibility for their behavior
6063958 the best part of telling the truth be it really direct or hurtful is that you never gotta lie
6063959 if youre under 21 and someones got alcohol youve got to drink it because you never know when somebodys going to have it again
6063960 focus more on what are the right questions how do i organize those questions what do those answers mean meaning what is the process in which i get the information consume it process it and ultimately make it actionable
6063961 when talking about decision support there is a need for a process to wrap how we make our decisions
6063962 this aspect covers pmo based processes service management and it governance aspects in the service management area specifically we are seeing closer alignment with ea the latest version of itil has alignment with ea practices

6063968 this is a sound bite in a broader conversation about urban policy and racial disparities
6063969 rethinking the whole governance structure requires that individuals learn new roles and relationships
6063970 in our study firms with more effective it governance had more senior management involvement cios must be effectively involved in it governance for success other senior managers must participate in the committees the approval processes and performance reviews for many enterprises this involvement is a natural extension of senior managements normal activities cios must be effectively involved in it governance for success many senior managers are willing to be involved but are not sure where to best contribute its very helpful for the cio and his or her staff to communicate it governance on one page with a picture like the governance arrangements matrix the matrix provides a vehicle for discussing each senior managers role and any concerns they have
6063971 good governance like good strategy requires choices its not possible for it governance to meet every goal but governance can and should highlight conflicting goals for debate as the number of tradeoffs increases governance becomes more complex top performing enterprises handle goal conflicts with a few clear business principles the resulting it principles reflect these business principles some of the most ineffective governance we have observed was the result of conflicting goals
6063972 exceptions are how enterprises learn in it terms exceptions challenge the status quo particularly the it architecture and infrastructure some requests for exceptions are frivolous but most come from a true desire to meet business needs formally approved exceptions offer a second benefit in addition to formalizing organizational learning about technology and architecture exceptions serve as a release valve relieving the enterprise of built up pressure managers become frustrated if they are told they cant do something they are sure is good for business if the exception proposed by a business unit has value a change to the it architecture could benefit the entire enterprise we have described the exceptions process of ups state street corporation and other enterprises all these exemplars have three common elements to their exceptions procedures the process is clearly defined and understood by all clear criteria and fast escalation encourage only business units with a strong case to pursue an exception the process has a few stages that quickly move the issue up to senior management thus the process minimizes the chance that architecture standards will delay project implementation successful exceptions are adopted into the enterprise architecture completing the organizational learning process
6063973 like any major organizational initiatives it governance must have an owner and accountabilities
6063974 its virtually impossible to have too much transparency or education about it governance transparency and education often go together the more education the more transparency and vice versa the more transparency of the governance processes the more confidence in the governance many firms like state street corporation use portals or intranets to communicate it governance state streets portal includes under the section it boards committees and councils a description of the architecture committee and all the other governance bodies the portal includes tools and resources such as a glossary of it terms and acronyms and the computer contract checklist often portals include lists of approved or recommended products templates for proposing it investments complete with spreadsheets to calculate the it business value are often available the less transparent the governance processes are the less people follow them the more special deals are made the less confidence there is in the process and the more workarounds are used communicating and supporting it governance is the single most important it role of senior leaders firms in our study with more effective governance also had more effective governance communication the more formal vehicles for communication were the most important
6063975 we began the book by describing how it governance fits into corporate governance we contend that enterprises using the same mechanisms to govern more than one of the six key assets have better governance relationship assets ip assets human assets information and it assets physical assets financial assets many enterprises successfully coordinate their six assets within a project but not across the enterprise via governance

6064038 i wanted to wear my favorite club monaco pencil skirt instead of the high waisted polyblend pants that made my hips expand and my butt flatten i had to admit when i put on that unflattering uniform and forfeited my feminine fashion i became more competent as a naval officer

6064051 guys might find you hot because you obviously are but that doesnt necessarily mean theyre going to value you as an artist

6064053 at the end of the day i have what i want which is the ability to keep making my art
6064054 yeah and i know that people say female sexuality is a tool and that we ought to be comfortable with using it
6064055 but its only a tool insofar as the dudes who control these industries have made it one it keeps women in this position of having to service men in order to earn their places at the table and that stifles female voices because if you can only get ahead on the condition that the male gatekeepers find you desirable you have to present yourself in a way that incites desire and you cant ever really be honest

6064214 tutti noi siamo ciechi dinnanzi ad uno dei fenomeni pi importanti delle nostre vite il reale funzionamento della macchina del potere si tratta di una cecit indotta dallo stesso potere al fine di perpetuarsi
6064215 questa disinformazione si realizza azionando due leve quella della censura informativa su tutti i fatti che riguardano i rapporti mafia potere
6064216 il lavoro di imposture culturali funzionali al potere affidato da sempre proprio agli intellettuali e costituisce una delle loro principali fonti di reddito
6064217 nel mondo della politica il potere come abbiamo accennato concentrato nelle mani di pochi oligarchi i quali oltre a nominare i parlamentari attribuiscono posti di comando in tutti gli snodi della istituzioni secondo criteri di fedelt
6064218 vi sono mille modi per distruggere la vita di una persona riducendola alla miseria gettandola nel discredito condannandola alla morte civile
6064219 il metodo mafioso che nella sostanza consiste nellabuso organizzato dei pochi sui molti e che si declina nelle pi svariate forme non infatti una creatura delle classi popolari ma delle classi alte
6064220 la corruzione in italia non sembra essere una deviazione del potere ma una forma
6064221 la societ della corruzione infatti genera la societ del ricatto
6064222 il metodo consiste nellintegrare nel proprio interno quanti pi soggetti possibili rendendoli complici e quindi ricattabili
6064223 sempre pi spesso mi accadeva di rendermi conto che il mondo degli assassini comunica attraverso mille porte girevoli con insospettabili salotti e con talune stanze ovattate del potere i peggiori tra loro avevano frequentato le nostre stesse scuole potevi incontrarli nei migliori ambienti e talora potevi vederli in chiesa battendosi il petto accanto a quelli che avevano gi condannato a morte
6064224 i riina i provengano i concutelli i fioravanti i chiesa i poggiolini non sono come si vorrebbe far credere dei mostri ma sono espressione di una mostruosa
6064225 questa criminalit dei potenti si declinata dallunit di italia ad oggi su tre versanti la corruzione sistemica la mafia e lo stragismo per fini politici
6064226 la questione criminale dunque in italia inscindibile da quelle dello stato e della democrazia
6064227 la mafia anche uno dei tanti complicati ingranaggi che nel loro insieme costituiscono la macchina del potere reale nazionale nessuno pu permettersi di svelare taluni segreti della parte oscena della storia che gli accaduto di intravedere senza rischiare di restare stritolato dalla reazione compatta e trasversale di tutto il sistema
6064228 neanche falcone poteva articolare compiutamente il proprio pensiero illuminando una realt di potere criminale intrecciato con quello legale cos complessa da sembrare ai pi incredibile e frutto di allucinazione
6064229 lintero sistema che chiede il silenzio e lo chiede perch certi segreti certe verit non sono gestibili pubblicamente n sul piano giudiziario n su quello politico la stessa coltre di silenzio giudiziario e politico calata sui tentativi di golpe e sui crimini commessi dal principe negli anni della strategia della tensione avvolge anche i crimini mafiosi il silenzio coatto sui crimini il sigillo del potere
6064230 personaggi come provenzano e riina e altri capi sono il sottoprodotto e la replica popolare di questo modo di esercitare il potere
6064231 nel tempo alcuni vertici militari della mafia sono stati cooptati nel circuito massonico
6064232 la massoneria occulta e deviata stata probabilmente una delle postazioni dalle quali alcuni vertici strategici del principe hanno utilizzato di volta in volta come bracci armati per i propri disegni di potere la mafia siciliana la ndrangheta la camorra la banda della magliana i servizi deviati
6064233 gioacchino pennino uomo donore medico e politico di rango divenuto collaboratore ha dichiarato a sua volta che lordine di uccidere dalla chiesa era stato trasmesso da roma tramite un uomo della p2 ora deceduto
6064234 in sostanza si assiste nel tempo ad un processo quasi fisiologico di integrazione tra massoneria segreta e deviata ed alcuni esponenti apicali delle mafie i quali allinterno delle loro rispettive organizzazioni di riferimento costituiscono strutture tenute segrete agli altri affiliati destinate a svolgere un ruolo di collegamento tra lite criminali dei ceti alti e lite criminali dei ceti bassi per la conduzione comune degli affari di pi alto livello e per i grandi giochi di potere
6064235 secondo le risultanze acquisite la regia di tale strategia che doveva attuarsi mediate una escalation di stragi e di sapienti mosse politiche era stata messa a punto dallala pi oltranzista del principe settori della massoneria deviata esponenti della destra eversiva segmenti dei servizi circoli imprenditoriali e finanziari
6064236 quel che mi pare interessante osservare che come emerso nel corso delle indagini il piano
6064237 solo un nucleo ristrettissimo ed eletto di capi quelli legati alla massoneria deviata ed il principe sanno il perch di quella accelerazione

6064291 qualcuno pensa e ne sono quasi convinti che lei e michele lucchese oltre a far parte dell entita di cosa nostra in segreto e allinsaputa di cosa nostra facevate anche parte dell entita dei pezzi deviati delle istituzioni nel gruppo dei servizi segreti deviati 55a risponda prima a questa domanda e poi alle altre che le ho fatto
6064292 continua da dove eravamo rimasti laltra volta anzi per essere pi precisi ti dico io dove eravamo rimasti
6064293 ecco cosa mi hai detto lultima volta tramite il lucchese sono venuto a conoscenza che allinterno dei servizi segreti deviati e allinsaputa del triumvirato con a capo lon miceli si era formata una corrente di uomini che osteggiavano totalmente sia lon miceli che il suo braccio destro questi uomini erano fidatissimi non a miceli e neanche al suo braccio destro ma erano fidatissimi al terzo rappresentante del triumvirato che voleva prendere il posto dellon miceli e sostiruire con uomo di fiducia del braccio desto di miceli ricordo anche che il lucchese mi disse che questo rappresentante del triumvirato era siciliano
6064294 se qualcuno pensa che io e michele lucchese allinsputa di cosa nostra facevamo anche parte dei servizi segreti deviati le rispondo subito no per che eravamo in contatto con alcuni uomini dei servizi segreti deviati che osteggiavano lon miceli e il suo braccio destro le dico si tre di questi uomini erano quelli che ci hanno accompagnati alla tenuta di latina messina denaro francesco ha ordinato e dato le direttive a lucchese michele affinch questi si mettesse in contatto con alcuni uomini dei servizi segreti deviati e di riferire soltanto a lui tutto ci che gli dicevano o che si faceva tutto ci era cos segreto e delicato che neanche i migliori uomini della nostra famiglia dovevano esserne al corrente il messina denaro francesco ha autorizzato il lucchese di servirsi solo di me e di farsi accompagnare da me quando lo riteneva opportuno questa scelta su di me il messina denaro francesco lha fatta cos mi disse lucchese 1 perch ero sempre vicino e in sintonia ottima con il lucchese 2 perch facevo bene il mio lavoro dentro la dogana dellaereoporto 3 perch gli sono piaciuto tantissimo quando ho ucciso alla tenuta di latina uno dei sequestrati 56 4 perch mi ha cresciuto fin da bambino e non si era mai dimenticato che allet di 16 anni per difendere il suo figlio matteo che era stato picchiato da alcuni ragazzi pi grandi di lui io sono intervenuto ed essendo che erano in tre mi hanno massacrato di botte e lu zu ciccio con tenerezza mi ha curato le ferite e dopo mi ha dato anche dei soldi il messina denaro francesco ha avuto lordine da bernardo provenzano di dare lincarico a lucchese in quanto questi era nella posizione giusta faceva parte della loggia massonica oltre ad avere dimostrato capacit a tenere bene contatti delicati e segreti il lucchese mi confid anche che dalle parole di messina denaro francesco aveva capito o intuito che forse neanche tot riina era al corrente della trama segreta che si stava tessendo per danneggiare e sostituire lon miceli provenzano si poteva permettere di tenere alloscuro tot riina in quanto aveva le spalle coperte dal triumvirato della supercommissione che in precedenza aveva contribuito e appoggiato segretamente provenzano per distruggere il triumvirato dell entita di cosa nostra che era rappresentato da bontade badalamenti e da luciano liggio che a sua volta si faceva rappresentare da provenzano e riina 57 se il tot riina stato messo alloscuro stato perch stravedeva per lon miceli

6064302 fino a pochi istanti fa ero seduto accanto a te ascoltando attentamente e volutamente ogni tua parola in questo momento non il tuo capo che ti parla ma un giudice che servir fedelmente lo stato e la societ civile fino allultimo momento
6064303 pagherei qualunque cosa pur di poter dire in faccia a questi cosiddetti capi che la decisione che hanno preso di uccidere il mio amico giovanni falcone non altro che una decisione ignobile partorita da una mente ancora pi ignobile lunica regola donore che gli era rimasta quella di non uccidere non le femmine ma le donne non lhanno neanche rispettata meritano veramente disprezzo questi uomini se cos si possono definire non rappresentano e non sono figli di una potente e nobile idea ma rappresentano e sono figli di una debole ignobile e malata idea del male incarnata nell illusione che li nutre di valori ignobili che entrano nella loro mente malata di uomini infami che non conoscono lonore e neanche quei grandi valori che stavano dietro il mio amico giovanni falcone e la sua donna che ha avuto solo la colpa di seguire il suo uomo queste parole le diceva con tanta rabbia ma io non gli dar la possibilit di uccidere la mia donna non glielo permetter mai ti dico anche che loro possono uccidere il mio corpo fisico e di questo ne sono ben cosciente ma sono ancora pi cosciente che non potranno uccidere le mie idee e tutto ci a cui credo 30 questi infami si erano illusi che uccidendo il mio amico giovanni avrebbero anche ucciso le sue idee e quel grande patrimonio di valori che stava dietro di lui ma si sono sbagliati perch il mio amico giovanni tutto ci che amava e onorava lo amava cos profondamente da legarselo nel suo animo rendendo cos tutto cu che onorava immortale

6064412 inizialmente quando mi occupai di queste cose credevo al caso non volevo credere che fosse una cosa voluta perch mi pareva fantascienza poi quando mi accorsi che i testimoni morivano tutti sistematicamente ho capito e una cosa che difficile da accettare
6064413 si paolo lo sapevo lo sapevo perch da medico legale mi rendo conto quando ci prendono in giro in tv e sui giornali tutti quei suicidi in carcere per soffocamento con buste di plastica sono impossibili dal punto di vista di medico legale analizzando alcuni dei pi importanti casi dal punto di vista medico legale mi sono accorto che ci prendono in giro e poi sono un appassionato di esoterismo e quindi i loro simboli e messaggi io li vedo vedi lesoterismo un linguaggio se non lo conosci come camminare per strade di una nazione straniera vedi la gente vedi le scritte ma non ti dicono nulla in certi casi potrebbero sembrarti innocui disegnini ma se invece lo conosci allora riesci a leggere oltre la superficie e capire i messaggi profondi che vengono lanciati e gli innocui disegnino diventano frasi precise capisci tutto ma con la maggior parte delle persone non puoi parlare perch ti prendono per matto e il problema principale quando capisci il sistema continuare a fare la vita di sempre senza impazzire
6064414 era con me al bar la sera prima di morire ha raccontato in mattinata era elegante in giacca e cravatta con il book delle fotografie tra le mani lho visto finalmente felice era arrivato da solo ha bevuto una birra e poi lho accompagnato a casa insieme al gestore del locale
6064415 mi sar spiegato male mi scuso perch parlavo in seconda persona facendo riferimento al gestore del bar lei ha scritto quello che ho detto in quel momento ma parlavo in seconda persona sono arrivato nel locale a mezzanotte e mezza quando il proprietario aveva gi portato a casa valentino
6064416 io lo dico fin dal primo giorno e sono stata trattata come una pazza sbotta mamma pantani marco stato ucciso e linchiesta deve essere riaperta ma non a rimini ho passato lintera estate a leggere gli atti del processo e sono sempre pi sicura che stato un omicidio marco dava fastidio a qualcuno
6064417 intanto sono convinta che marco sia morto tra le 11 30 e le 12 non tra le 14 e le 17 come hanno sostenuto dice e nella sua camera cera qualcuno ha chiesto aiuto pi volte ci sono le telefonate che ha fatto alla reception dellalbergo dalle 8 30 alle 10 nellultima diceva chiamate i carabinieri chiamate i carabinieri che qui ci sono persone che mi danno fastidio mio figlio stava morendo e nessuno intervenuto io credo che ci siano gli estremi per lomissione di soccorso e prima dellintervento della polizia c un buco di ore di molte ore nelle quali in quella camera successo di tutto
6064418 il portiere dellalbergo ha detto che quando entrato la camera era a posto cera soltanto un attaccapanni caduto chi ha fatto tutti quei danni alla stanza nel filmato della polizia c un casino totale marco non pu essere stato perch le sue mani non presentavano nemmeno un graffio
6064419 marco aveva la faccia graffiata e un segno molto evidente dietro lorecchio sinistro qualcuno pu averlo costretto a mangiare droga accanto alla bocca e sotto il suo corpo cera mollica di pane mista a cocaina qualcuno deve averla preparata e quelle tracce di cibo cinese che nessuno ha mai ordinato e marco non ha mai mangiato in vita sua
6064420 altro che uno solo come dicevano allinizio qualcuno deve essere venuto anche da milano perch marco era arrivato a rimini con uno zainetto e una sola giacca mentre la polizia mi ha restituito una borsa con tre giacconi almeno due di quelli erano a milano e qualcuno deve averglieli portati chi perch
6064421 c la frase del capo degli spacciatori a uno dei galoppini che gli portavano la coca che dice adesso dobbiamo risolvere il problema pantani marco era un personaggio troppo noto e forse dava fastidio a qualcuno e poi c il mondo del ciclismo che non lo amava e non voleva che tornasse a correre sapere quello che successo davvero diventato la ragione della mia esistenza voglio sapere chi cera con lui e perch marco morto io non lo lascer solo
6064422 certo nei prossimi anni qualcosa dovr cambiare a questo sistema destinato prima o poi a saltare perch sono in troppi a sapere
6064423 il giro daffari nello sport professionistico mostruoso e davanti ad interessi di quel calibro la vita di pantani conta veramente poco

6064460 per cinque anni insomma il sismi il pi grande e potente servizio di informazione e sicurezza italiano 2500 addetti di concerto con altri segmenti della burocrazia dello stato si trasformato nel braccio operativo di una parte politica nel tentativo di manipolare lopinione pubblica condizionare le scelte del parlamento attaccare gli avversari dellopposto schieramento ed influenzare lesito delle elezioni queste sono in sintesi le storie che di seguito raccontiamo

6064484 il lavoro di bernays consisteva nel dare un nuovo significato ad un soggetto per creare quellimmagine desiderata che avrebbe poi dato a quel particolare prodotto o concetto il livello daccettazione voluto
6064485 bernays descriveva il pubblico come un gregge che ha bisogno di venire guidato
6064486 bernays credeva che solo pochi possedevano la necessaria perspicacia per vedere la grande visione cos che venisse loro affidata la sacra missione e fortunatamente si vide come uno dei pochi
6064487 non appena i pionieri della persuasione del 1920 ivy lee ed edward bernays ottennero maggior esperienza iniziarono a formulare regole e guide per creare lopinione pubblica impararono presto che la psicologia delle masse deve focalizzarsi sullemozione non sui fatti
6064488 dato che la massa incapace di formulare pensieri razionali corsivo mio la motivazione deve basarsi non sulla logica ma sulla presentazione

6064493 io so perch sono un intellettuale e collego fatti anche apparentemente lontani
6064494 in seguito al successo formidabile di ieri il nostro post ha guadagnato il primo posto essendo stato il pi votato tra tutti i post del blog di beppegrillo
6064495 franceschetti solo unultima cosa prima di darmi quelle risposte ti eri andato a controllare i link che avevo esposto per vedere effettivamente cosa diceva paolo dorigo
6064496 per tutto possibile per carit magari un giorno mi sveglio e scopro di essere il mostro di firenze e che durante il sonno vado a uccidere coppiette
6064497 essendo un mio amico inoltre il mio giudizio sarebbe parziale perch voglio troppo bene a lui e a suo fratello per prendere in considerazione una cosa del genere
6064498 appena un anno fa non venti o trenta ma un anno fa andai a parlare con un magistrato che ritenevo fosse incorruttibile e coraggioso e poco tempo dopo ho scoperto che costui era ai vertici della massoneria proprio nella stessa associazione di coloro che avevo denunciato portando documenti e carte varie ed probabilmente lui il mandante degli incidenti che poi mi sono capitati
6064499 per tutto possibile per carit magari un giorno mi sveglio e scopro di essere il msotro di firenze e che durante il sonno vado a uccidere coppiette ma spero proprio di no perch marcello una delle persone che stimo di pi al mondo
6064500 primo tra tutti perch pubblica sempre i miei articoli in cui parlo della rosa rossa e questultima strettamente collegata alla cia e poi non riesco a capire dove sarebbe il vantaggio per la cia dato il contenuto degli articoli che pubblica
6064501 pare che lindon larouche sia addirittura un membro della golden dawn quindi probabilmente addirittura nella rosa rossa i cui riti sono presi credo proprio dalla golden dawn eppure uno dei siti di contrinformazione pi accreditati al mondo e anche io trovo il lavoro che fa decisamente superbo quanto a informazione ancora non ho capito come si concili il suo lavoro con lappartenere alla golden dawn
6064502 perch vedi al di l del fatto che anche nel loro lavoro c lo zampino della massoneria senzaltro ci non significa che non dicano anche cose corrette diciamo che sono le cose che non dicono il problema
6064503 grillo invece per quello che percepisco mi pare in gran parte in buona fede quindi non capisco il senso di ci che fa allora ci sono delle cose che mi sfuggono tuttavia bene ricordare che siamo nel campo delle ipotesi se per travaglio per fare un parallelo ho delle certezze il fenomeno grillo continua a essere un mistero per me
6064504 un informazione per essere libera veramente deve 1 aprirsi al confronto cosa che ne travaglio ne grillo fanno mai 2 mettere in discussione se stessi
6064505 stai tranquillo avevo capito che la tua era una domanda e non un assioma credo che chi frequenta questo sito abbia pi domande che risposte come me
6064506 comunque ammesso e non concesso che nexus fosse collegata alla cia non significa che pamio debba per forza essere in mala fede
6064507 ho spedito il link che mi hai indicato a marcello pamio e voglio vedere cosa mi risponder
6064508 franceschetti solo unultima cosa prima di darmi quelle risposte ti eri andato a controllare i link che avevo esposto per vedere effettivamente cosa diceva paolo dorigo vorrei poi da te una breve delucidazione o magari da abate vella visto che mi sembrato essere il pi ferrato in materia ma tra rosa rossa e rosacroce quali sono le differenze ciao e salutami anche solange da un po che non si sente nel blog 13 maggio 2008 19 26
6064509 franceschetti solo unultima cosa prima di darmi quelle risposte ti eri andato a controllare i link che avevo esposto per vedere effettivamente cosa diceva paolo dorigo
6064510 veltroni rimane il lombrico di forattini degli anni ottanta etc
6064511 il pdl e la speranza del presente ha aggiunto non e un partito non e un cartello elettorale e molto di piu
6064512 il colore della muffa e della putrefazione del venefico cloro dellacidit e per il medioevo della follia ancora la nostra psiche lo collega con situazioni di malattia e di estremo disagio verde per la bile verde di paura perci nel medioevo si dipingevano di questo colore diavoli e draghi
6064513 non vorremmo per poi ricordarci male ma qualcuno se non ricordo male a verona mi aveva detto che il responsabile del ccdu a padova era marcello pamio se fosse lui parlammo al telefono ed escluse la possibilit di aiutarci reperendo medici chirurghi per loperazione se ricordo male le mie scuse se non ricordo male si spiega perch abbia fatto una selezione del film lasciando il capitolo politico filo yankee togliendo tutti i riferimenti al ccdu
6064514 ma su queste cose speriamo di poterci confrontare pi avanti e molto pi approfonditamente con marcello pamio
6064515 i giornalisti che ancora danno dignit a questo paese con la loro voce vanno protetti dagli sciaccalli di regime dai killer della parola
6064516 aver aperto una campagna critica contro anno zero e contro lo stesso travaglio
6064517 potresti scrivere tu stesso a pamio non pensi che sia la soluzione migliore
6064518 alcune precisazioni ho scritto che santoro e travaglio sono massoni
6064519 non posso e non voglio dare giudizi su tutto su certe cose posso solo limitarmi a leggere informarmi e aspettare di capire qualcosa prendiamo atto entrambi del fatto che pamio non ha risposto e chiudiamo qui
6064520 un informazione per essere libera veramente deve 1 aprirsi al confronto cosa che ne travaglio ne grillo fanno mai 2 mettere in discussione se stessi
6064521 inoltre ludovico ha un fratello con cui un tempo eravamo molto amici

6064523 i havent had a chance to thank you for everything i hope you realize that your creativity inspired our entire wedding from the invites to the chandeliers to the cake everything had your signature on it
6064524 vogliono distruggerti psicologicamente perch la distruzione psicologica allo stato delle cose per loro meglio della morte
6064525 non posso mettere a rischio la vita dei miei familiari
6064526 come puoi essere cos egoista da far correre rischi simili alla tua famiglia
6064527 nessuno mi aiuta perch nessuno crede a quello che dico e in procura mi spariscono i fascicoli e le minacce provenivano dagli inquirenti
6064528 io ho 71 anni in fondo non mi importa nulla tu fai quello che ritieni giusto ma parlane con i tuoi fratelli
6064529 perch lhai fatto se hai capito subito che questa persona aveva diversi problemi
6064530 non giocare con chi ha tanti amici gioca con coloro che sono rifiutati dagli altri aiuta le persone che nessuno vuole aiutare
6064531 fai quello ritieni giusto paolino noi ti appoggiamo comunque credo
6064532 ciao come pensi che ti uccideranno ma secondo te che data sceglieranno una data che fa tredici come somma o undici

6064536 io so i nomi dei responsabili di quello che viene chiamato golpe e che in realt una serie di golpes istituitasi a sistema di protezione del potere
6064537 espulso dal pci il poeta pasolini la federazione del pci di pordenone ha deliberato in data 26 ottobre lespulsione dal partito del dott pier paolo pasolini di casarsa per indegnit morale prendiamo spunto dai fatti che hanno determinato un grave provvedimento disciplinare a carico del poeta pasolini per denunciare ancora una volta le deleterie influenze di certe correnti ideologiche e filosofiche dei vari gide sartre e di altrettanto decantati poeti e letterati che si vogliono atteggiare a progressisti ma che in realt raccolgono i pi deleteri aspetti della degenerazione borghese
6064538 credo inoltre che molti altri intellettuali e romanzieri sappiano ci che so io in quanto intellettuale e romanziere perch la ricostruzione della verit a proposito di ci che successo in italia dopo il 1968 non poi cos difficile
6064539 del sid generale miceli arrestato per cospirazione politica probabilmente i giornalisti e i politici hanno anche delle prove o almeno degli indizi ora il problema questo i giornalisti e i politici pur avendo forse delle prove e certamente degli indizi non fanno i nomi a chi dunque compete fare questi nomi evidentemente a chi non solo ha il necessario coraggio ma insieme non compromesso nella pratica col potere e inoltre non ha per definizione niente da perdere cio un intellettuale

6064543 quello che posso dirti che la maggior parte delle notizie che passano nei tg forse tutte sono in realt dei messaggi e bisogna andare oltre quello che viene detto
6064544 ti regaler una rosa una rosa rossa per dipingere ogni cosa
6064545 in italia si sta male si sta bene anzich no
6064546 forse lidroscalo da mettere in relazione con le indagini sulla morte di mattei
6064547 in brasile la fiat non ha portato soltanto le fabbriche ha costruito anche prigioni dentro gli
6064548 e un simbolo doppiofallico quindi infertile quindi legato alla morte
6064549 la differenza essenziale tra la massoneria e la rosa croce che la rosa croce non ha alcunobbedienza e inoltre a livello mondiale ha sempre rifiutato un impegno socio politico
6064550 siamo cos potenti che possiamo permetterci il lusso di far fuori chi cerca di osteggiarci proprio dove si immagina possa essere pi protetto
6064551 vincerai se porterai a compimento il tuo processo di individuazione raggiungendo la totalit del tuo s
6064552 grazie dei fior fra tutti gli altri li ho riconosciuti mi han fatto male eppure li ho graditi son rose rosse e parlano damor

6064555 cosa nostra il braccio armato dei poteri occulti in sicilia la ndrangheta in calabria la camorra in campania
6064556 la gente stanca di sborsare 25 o 30 milioni ad agosto per una villa a sabaudia
6064557 ma come mai in italia va tutto cos vistosamente male
6064558 in europa esistono questo il governo con meno persone che rappresentano il cattolicesimo non mi pare berlusconi sia un baciapile aveva dichiarato barbareschi magari dir cose sconvenienti ma insomma i leader principali del pdl fini e berlusconi sono separati e hanno figli da mogli diverse
6064559 sono stato violentato da un prete al di l dei danni ai singoli esseri umani si deve capire che la pedofilia un danno di macroeconomia tanti bambini molestati fanno una generazione che cresce con una struttura debole ora su questo argomento si svegliato pure papa ratzinger
6064560 non ho mai affermato come riportato nel titoletto in alto a pagina 96 si alle adozioni gay in europa esistono questo e il governo con meno persone che rappresentano il cattolicesimo non mi pare berlusconi sia un baciapile si affretta a spiegare barbareschi in particolare non ho mai pronunciato la parola baciapile inoltre non ho mai detto in merito alla domanda sulle violenze ai bambini ora su questo tema si e svegliato pure papa ratzinger che e una espressione poco riguardosa nei confronti del santo padre

6064567 the sun never shined on a cause of greater worth
6064568 why is it important to rehash what connell did in 2000 florida and 2004 ohio because those very same key elements for potential election theft are firmly in place within the mccain campaign for 2008

6064570 deceived congress with fabricated threats of iraq weapons of mass destruction wmd to fraudulently obtain support for an authorization for the use of force against iraq and used that fraudulently obtained authorization and then acting in his capacity under article ii section ii of the constitution as commander in chief to commit us troops to combat in iraq
6064571 then certainly lying to the american people about invading iraq

6064574 i dont think a vaccine specialist could do it this is aerosol physics not biology there are very few people who have their feet in both camps
6064575 i really dont think hes the guy i say to the fbi show me your evidence
6064576 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
6064577 mourns the loss of dr bruce ivins who served the institute for more than 35 years as a civilian microbiologist
6064578 that seems like an unusual thing to say if you believe one of your employees had something to do with an anthrax attack
6064579 it now remains incumbent on the fbi to reveal what information it had linking ivins to the attacks given the federal governments record on the anthrax investigation and the national security interests involved ivins death should not be used as an excuse for the case to be closed without a full public airing
6064580 the family definitely wants to be able to see the evidence that the fbi has accumulated that theyre not just trying to make this guy a scapegoat
6064581 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
6064582 dozens of other researchers in ivins lab also had access to the type of ames strain used in the attacks the scientist said meaning the dna alone is not enough to prove his guilt
6064583 the fbi owes it to the country to provide some accounting of their investigation and their expectations for a successful conclusion
6064584 its been frustrating that the fbi has essentially shut out congress throughout its seven year investigation now seems to be the opportune time for the bureau to brief congress about whether the case is to be closed and justice will be served in the meantime we should remember that a rush to judgment can be dangerous and expensive for everyone the last person the fbi had in its sights in this case suffered for six years and just collected a 6 million settlement

6064622 planning a wedding is very stressful its crazy my gardener is now invited
6064623 an attack against this memorial is clearly directed against homosexuals that can be said without waiting for further police investigations we must show our condemnation of this act of intolerance and homophobia
6064624 everything suggests that this attack was motivated by a hatred of homosexuals the attack shows in a drastic way how necessary this monument is hostility to homosexuals remains virulent the kissing scene shown in the monument evidently hit the mark even in a democratic society there are people who cant stand the sight of men kissing in public
6064625 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
6064626 katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are
6064627 i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
6064628 we cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child but she knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin but the bible also promotes understanding and forgiveness which i keep reminding myself
6064629 katy was raised in a very strict christian household she started performing in church at nine she was a special child she loved to sing and had an angelic voice that is why this is all so disappointing and sad
6064630 katy is not a homosexual but i fear she has been led astray by the hollywood crowd i pray all the time that god will work through her and help her find salvation
6064631 some are too revealing and her father has had words with her about it like any child she is going through a period of rebellion

6064638 while youre reading safe at home it becomes obvious that richard doster loves baseball but this is far more than a baseball book its a history lesson and a social commentary its about doing the right thing in the face of brutal consequences its about courage overcoming the ignorance of racism its about using your god given talents whether youre playing the game or writing about the players who do yeah this books about baseball but when you really get down to it its about the soul
6064639 this story pulls at your heartstrings as you read about how the simple game of baseball has changed the hearts and minds of so many in our country this is a reminder of how far we have come over the years and how courage dreams and a love for a game can move mountains i enjoyed the journey through the pages of safe at home and i know you will too
6064640 is it alright for me to feel this way put my head in your lap the world will go away well well we can go there we can go anywhere

6064675 the reason why they like the 68 team is because many of us stayed here and lived here now and in other years guys go back to wherever theyre from or most of them now go to warm weather places because they make so much money the 68 team we had a lot of guys who lived in town that were available accessible going to the market going to outings so they would see us around

6064782 citizens united head david bossie might be hopeful that as the campaign moves forward some right wing websites might offer the film as a premium as they have for the books
6064783 in order to get regular voters to go see the movie it will have to garner media buzz on the cable television news networks like the anti obama books have

6064787 bossie is a political hatchet man whose career is based on smears and attacking democrats
6064788 his obama documentary will provide plenty of footage for use on the internet and in commercials but i doubt that in and of itself that
6064789 i assume that the overall theme of obama as socialist agent disguised as cult hero must be resonating in the political marketing surveys of the bossie types and the mccain operatives or they would switch to something more effective
6064790 going back to the days when he was unremitting in his attacks against bill and hillary clinton bossies forte has never been accuracy
6064791 it has been bloodletting and in that regard if hype gets any traction at all it is likely to be viewed as the political counterpart of the horror movie franchise saw v due to be released just before the election

6064821 we work very closely with the paralympic teams dietician and she recommends the products they need to use
6064822 i should clarify my mention of the glamour with all the very colourful publicity and viral marketing one could easily be led to believe that x publishers current success is more down to the cultivation of image than to the quality of the writing i see a double risk in the creation of so much hype and excitement around a book particularly before its published firstly the more a book is talked about the higher the expectations raised and consequently the greater the probability of disappointment when it finally reaches the hands of the reader y and z are both enjoyable books but i think the author will agree that they showed a lot of room for improvement secondly it is not a secret that in todays popular culture the more a phenomenon is mentioned the sooner people become tired of hearing about it however promising the quality or delight offered by the subject concerned perhaps this is particularly the case among adolescents and young adults who may feel pressured to consume a particular item a book for example in order to acquire and be able to demonstrate a sense of integration with the central popular norm what may be considered cool and fashionable today will quickly be forgotten tomorrow unless of course the talent and message naked of the parafernalia note how im retaining the spelling makes the substance of his postulation even more ironically interesting which smothers them inspire enough awe to speak for themselves and project themselves through the changes of time as martin luther king once said only when it is dark enough can you see the stars once the hot air ceases to blow and the balloon is released we will see how high and far it floats

6064830 george eliots feminist sympathies were strong yet ambivalent she freely conceded the prejudices of the era asking in 1855 that a writer friend not reveal the fact that she was the author of an essay in the westminster review the article appears to have produced a strong impression and that impression would be a little counteracted if the author were known to be a woman
6064831 having no middle name her first harry potter book was published under the name joanne rowling but before publishing her first book in the u s her publisher bloomsbury was concerned that the target audience young boys might not buy books by a female author the company recommended rowling use two initials instead of her first name rowling chose k for kathleen the name of her paternal grandmother
6064832 women rarely published books of verse anonymously with surprisingly few exceptions women who published poetry books proudly placed their real names on the title page from the very outset of their careers such was the case with lucy aikin mathilda betham felicia hemans mary howitt mary leadbeater mary russell mitford hannah more amelia opie sydney owenson mary robinson anna seward charlotte smith agnes strickland ann yearsley and many others when a woman did bring out a book of poetry anonymously it was often her first book and her name appeared quickly on the title pages of subsequent editions and later volumes this first book was a trial balloon so to speak a testing of the waters

6065289 illegal file sharing is a very serious issue resulting in millions of pounds of losses to copyright owners
6065290 it really is a new world out there and its time the new reality was accepted for what it is
6065291 just being a student athlete youre lifes being scrutinized enough so i havent felt that way at all
6065292 a j s a great guy and hes everything the media said he was hes an awesome player and hes going to be great here
6065293 hes got a chance of surprising some people coming in the same year as a j
6065294 everybodys talking about a j this a j that tavarres is a good player in his own right
6065295 id love to play i really hope ill play i feel good about playing
6065296 but its not my job to decide how that happens its my job to give 110 percent in practice
6065297 confidence is a big thing in anybodys life and when you go from being the man in high school to coming and everybody else is the man its very eye opening
6065298 your confidence is all youve got and that is a huge confidence booster
6065299 you have to look the runner back you have young players they are going to do some things hopefully they learn from it that was a tough way for johnny to give up his only run
6065300 it seems like theyre starting to sync into that little lineup there
6065301 its not really a big secret to me i dont really care if anybody knows who our starting lineup is i say it the way i said it because im still not sure thats how were going to end up but thats how it would be if we played tomorrow
6065302 hes actually been playing some right tackle and looking pretty good at it
6065303 we messed around with him at tackle a little bit last year too hes athletic enough to do it the more reps he gets the better off hell be
6065304 this is about the time in their careers where they should be making progress
6065305 that will be the first time were on the same team offense and defense since the bowl game really its fun to get everybody on the same sideline and put the enemy on the other sideline
6065306 i dont know if its solidified but hes spending more time at left than right now
6065307 that green jersey is supposed to keep you from having to strike anybody or have someone strike you but when you get the ball in your hand you tend to get shots i think hes getting plenty right now
6065308 he got a shot on his knee in the last scrimmage its a bone bruise shot more than a structural issue
6065309 and there were a lot of things going on out there all day today it was pretty good it wasnt great if it wasnt a monday and it was coming off a day off and the first day of school i would say not very good but usually those days are tough to have it happen the way you want it to
6065310 youve got to measure whats in your heart what you want to do do you want to come back and try to win a championship do you want to win some type of national award or just see what it feels like to be that senior to be that leader if you talk a guy into staying when he really doesnt want to stay then youre probably not going to have that good a leader anyway he loves it here he felt like he had some growing to do as a man and as a ball player and he felt like it was in his best interest to come back i think once you become a senior and you realize this is your last shot you play with a little more passion and youre going to take on a leadership responsibility that you didnt have before
6065311 i would say right now blair walsh leads the extra point and field goal race i dont know if we have a kick off man yet i like how brian mimbs is punting the ball and drew butler has been much improved i feel very comfortable with our punters right now
6065312 i see charles white really beginning to learn hes always been eager to strike someone hes very physical but hes getting more comfortable dowtin has got a lot of great tools but his knowledge is holding him back right now but i think hell play this year or wed sure like for him to play theyre all coming along but i cant say anybodys a stick of dynamite right now
6065313 right now we are going on the premise that they are all going to play every one of them well still sort it out but theres other seasons youre more sure a guys probably not going to be ready but every one of those dbs our true freshmen backs our true freshmen receivers our true freshmen defensive backs they all are in the running for playing time and a much higher percentage will play than wont
6065314 theyre all talented weve got a good recruiting staff here they brought in good athletes theyre learning its a learning process but its camp thats what theyre here for but they look real good out there theres going to be some guys that are not going to get that redshirt theres going to be some guys that will theyre still competing im still competing
6065315 this year weve got more experience last year we had all freshmen i was backing up chester adams vince was backing up chris everybody who was backing up people are a couple of starters now or on the second team now as far as the rotation this year the second team are doing way more plays than they did last year all we did was a certain amount of plays and that was it this year theyre getting different varieties of plays and theyre executing real well
6065316 you cant really play scared youve just got to play the game of football its a high risk sport but thats life youve got to protect yourself but if youre helping your team out doing those extra duties like that thats the important thing
6065317 you can do things like this when you have a team focused when its time to practice we were focused we were ready to get work done today but him letting us off everyone just gets excited
6065318 to be honest with you the boot is easy the worst thing is the crutches you take it for granted being able to walk around when youre on crutches when you get back walking you know what a gift it is
6065319 we want cordy to taste tackle and in the beginning we were much more apt to think he was going to play tackle
6065320 but we were thinking he was going to be a backup when he moved in at guard and played so well at guard now he may win that job
6065321 they switched me up left and right in high school so they can switch me up here it really doesnt matter
6065322 we really like what vance has been doing at guard
6065323 were trying not to disrupt that but if we have to we will
6065324 i think his energy level moved up a notch thinking he might be the guy and i liked what i saw
6065325 its not like we said dont play josh hes competing
6065326 boling is the one guy we thought could play either tackle or guard
6065327 if there were no injuries he might have been the guy that was going to be the puddy guy but everybody else was going to stick
6065328 this is a schedule that will challenge us from the first game through the last game
6065329 hopefully we will grow as were challenged in the early portion of the non conference schedule to the point where we can be successful as we finish non conference games because those last few certainly get difficult and then we jump out of the frying pan and into the fire as we start sec play
6065330 that motivates me to work harder knowing ive got people looking at me expecting big things
6065331 if he can get to the point where he doesnt have to think so much and he can really turn it lose hes going to play
6065332 theres no specific number of plays i want to see i just want to be on the field
6065333 im just waiting for that moment to step on the field
6065334 in high school you have your three or four plays on defense but you come here and theres plays for each formation
6065335 im not yet the starter but im next best man going in so i think thats pushing me to become a starter
6065336 i feel a lot more pressure being counted on and winning the coaches trust
6065337 a bigger spotlight means i cant mess up on stuff
6065338 i think just watching cordy physically it didnt take long to say he can do it this year
6065339 if you say slip or slide or tex or denver or all these calls that mean something if you say it to a guy at the last second even thats not easy to learn
6065340 hes big hes strong and he knows what hes doing pretty well for a true freshman im excited i think hes going to be a good player
6065341 hier gibt es 80 iphones danach ist das wieder f r einen monat nicht zu bekommen

6065343 ive been working on my speed a lot and ive gained about 10 12 pounds
6065344 im just trying to get my weight up and get a little more physical in my blocking
6065345 he had a great end of the year last year i think he expects it of himself and we do of him to play well this year
6065346 theres a lot of balls that are going to be thrown because weve got great running backs and a great quarterback in matthew
6065347 weve all been working extremely hard and i think youre going to see six or seven of us with 25 to 30 catches
6065348 ever since i first got here hes always taken me under his wing and nothings changed since hes been injured
6065349 he comes out to practice after he rehabs and hes always standing there coaching me up if i have questions i know i can go to him and hell give me great answers
6065350 brannan i think hes the best fullback in the country
6065351 i think as far as nerves and mentally hes got it down
6065352 its one of those things that if you practice hard all youve got to do is do it on saturday
6065353 i want him to do good for the team and good for himself then hopefully when i come back hes playing great and then its going to be a competition to see whos going to play
6065354 thats what we want it just makes the team better

6065364 im not sure whether well pull the trigger there or not but hes working there
6065365 knowshon will do anything you ask him to do were trying to get our best players across the board at any position including special teams and he has an aptitude for it
6065366 a guy in those positions could get banged up to where he cant play qb and that would be scary but i think weve just got to let him play right now
6065367 i was really focused on trinton was the starting left tackle so i kind of knew i was going to have to work hard to get playing time behind him
6065368 now that hes out i feel a lot of weight on my shoulders
6065369 me and him we have similar personalities so were always around each other laughing telling jokes when he got hurt it hurt me i saw him in the training room i had to fight back tears

6065402 many networks are the product of dynamical processes that add or remove vertices or edges for instance a social network of friendships changes as individuals make and break ties with others an individual with many acquaintances might by virtue of being better connected or better known be more likely to make new friends than someone else who is less well connected or individuals seeking friends might be more likely to meet people with whom they share a common acquaintance the ties people make affect the form of the network and the form of the network affects the ties people make social network structure therefore evolves in a historically dependent manner in which the role of the participants and the patterns of behavior they follow cannot be ignored
6065403 because of the effort involved in compiling them social network datasets rarely document populations of more than a hundred people and almost never more than a thousand and although other kinds of nonsocial networks have not suffered from the same difficulties empirical examples prior to the last decade have been few probably because other network oriented disciplines have lacked the empirical focus of sociology the lack of high quality large scale network data has in turn delayed the development of the kind of statistical models with which much of the work in this book is concerned such models as we will see can be very successful and informative when applied to large networks but tend to break down or simply dont address the right questions when applied to small ones

6065441 i dove into politics for the same reason i created the gn network i couldnt stand it any longer i had to try to make a difference to my country when i saw it veering sharply from wiser paths but while i made inroads with my grassroots work i couldnt help but notice that politics is mostly a negative business its very nature is divisive and seems to direct our focus onto the worst in people opponents in our grassroots campaign though i experienced a tremendous outpouring of camaraderie from people young and old who like me had never been involved in politics before it was spurred on by anger yes like the gn network had been but it was mostly a joy filled effort infused with positive thinking rather than negative many many americans of every stripe appreciated the way we talked to them on train platforms sidewalks libraries and doorways with respect like citizens rather than consumers however i gladly returned to work on the gn network with a goal to bring compassion back into our discourse instead of polarizing society into two camps which politics necessarily must we instead focus on the commonality of human experience infusing both sides with the eagerness to overcome adversity and improve the human condition we will nurture the instinct for community and cooperation over competition and tribalism

6065650 people will say omarion is still out there and in the pubic omarion is still successful but they dont sit back and think why is omarion able to get this opportunity why are they not getting this opportunity fizz put a single out
6065651 i used to rock with them dudes and now when i see them its not like that

6065653 a release is different from a drop when an artist is dropped usually they havent brought any revenue to the company as you know ive been with that company for a long time roughly over six years throughout b2k and my solo albums revenue was still brought in an artist like me could never get dropped how did i get dropped and i still ended up in a great situation usually when you hear drop it means oh hes over its a wrap its unfortunate that stuff like that gets put out there everybody likes to associate especially me being such a cool dude with negative things are you kidding me
6065654 were just picking each others brains to see what can be done differently
6065655 my energetic style and aggressiveness when i perform i dont think thats necessarily been captured for the length of an album i always felt like i had joints like touch even entourage where its upbeat but it hasnt been captured in an album all these crazy new dances all these different things i wanna do when i look at my peers in the game they capture the true essence of who they are i kinda felt like throughout my career i had just blots of that
6065656 there is very good demand from the retail buyers as they are buying ahead of the marriage season and diwali
6065657 we are not able to meet the demand as it has outpaced the supply
6065658 there were only six of us to begin with just having a drink and listening to music
6065659 then a couple of other friends turned up that i hadnt seen for ages we heard some shouting in the street and went out to see what was going on
6065660 then more people let themselves in uninvited and it all went downhill from there
6065661 there was flour all over the floor and blood everywhere people were cutting their feet on broken glass i was really upset
6065662 i went round to apologise to all my neighbours the next day
6065663 it was awful there were about 30 teenagers drunk and running riot in the street one window was smashed
6065664 they appeared to be drunk and were screaming they kept us up all night from 11pm
6065665 people felt frightened in their own homes and one elderly woman told me she was too scared to even turn the light on to call the police it is totally unacceptable
6065666 one girl was even running around wielding a large stick it was utterly terrifying one of the residents on the street described it as being like beirut
6065667 about 20 lads were going up and down the street shouting and screaming until about four in the morning
6065668 it was just horrendous we didnt get much sleep that night they broke a window and scratched two cars we dont expect that kind of behaviour round here
6065669 holly invited some friends around and all of a sudden weve got world war three
6065670 our neighbours phoned us when we were away and they told us the whole neighbourhood had been talking about it
6065671 they told us their had been fighting in the street smashed glass everywhere and some of our elderly neighbours were terrified
6065672 we had a right go at holly over the phone because we had been told that the house had been smashed up i was heartbroken
6065673 weve been told it was like kosovo it got completely out of hand something happened out on the street and somehow holly got involved
6065674 its just really embarrassing its out of character for holly because she is a good kid and has been bought up the right way
6065675 but we have to hold our hands up and apologise because if there was no party to begin with none of this would have happened
6065676 police received three calls from residents that evening reporting disturbances and reports of youths fighting
6065677 this is concerning and we are looking to increase police patrols of that area to reassure the public
6065678 a lot of bricks but i dont know what the building looks like

6065730 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
6065731 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
6065732 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
6065733 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship she once said samanthas the father i never had
6065734 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
6065735 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
6065736 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house

6065838 this is the most important line im going to show you a world without sin in the film to me because obviously the film is really about something its about the right to be wrong its about the idea that you cannot impose your way of thinking on somebody even if your way of thinking is more enlightened and better than theirs its simply not how human beings are
6065839 you take that further and you say the idea of sin is in fact outmoded is in fact more archaic than anything mal believes in when he says im a fan of all seven sins hes saying that sin is just what people are its been codified its been given a name but all of those things we take as false are also the source of pleasure and decency and we should perhaps rethink it
6065840 all of those things we take as false are also the source of pleasure and decency
6065841 just making sure you dont go to hell when you die

6065856 if anything we have great team commitment people understand the organizational goals and have truly bought into that direction it s clear from their words and actions that they are committed to our organizational goals and yet something is still missing i m not sure what it is
6065857 we re missing something in the productivity area as well but my team is committed too they are staunchly proud of the team in fact they wave the team banner regularly i m surprised they haven t had t shirts made they believe in the team s role they know that what they do is important and like i said man are they proud
6065858 my team is tremendously committed to each other they are supportive give each other great feedback and are always looking out for each other more so than any other team i ve ever seen with all this commitment i m baffled why they aren t more successful
6065859 i was thinking about our team commitment conversation last night and i woke up this morning with an idea i think we do all have committed teams but they aren t committed to the same things i think what we really need is a combination of the three types of commitments each of our teams have look at it this way

6065920 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
6065921 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
6065922 americas future depends on the health of our country the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our health care costs our analysis shows that we are not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
6065923 even though communities have started taking action considering the scope of the problem the countrys response has been severely limited for significant change to happen combating obesity must become a national priority

6065936 this confirms what a lot of recent studies have found no benefit of taking vitamin b supplements to reduce the risk of heart disease and it raises a few red flags
6065937 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events
6065938 there is no evidence that individuals should take b vitamins to decrease the risk of heart disease and there may be some evidence that they shouldnt
6065939 the observational data was great but the interventional studies were negative
6065940 we have been optimistic about the role of antioxidants such as vitamin b in preventing heart disease yet many of these large trials have shown that there is no benefit
6065941 but at this point it is certainly hard to recommend extra supplements when we dont have proof of benefit
6065942 what we can recommend is a diet with fruits and vegetables that have antioxidant vitamins in them

6065971 surely the arm of the lord is not too short to save nor his ear too dull to hear but your iniquities have separated you from god your sins have hidden his face from you so that he will not hear

6065981 designing a home with comfortable furnishings is essential to creating an enjoyable space but when we seek to create a blessed home a sanctuary complete with comfort and joy our primary focus should be on creating a positive and hopeful atmosphere we should strive to design an environment where our loved ones and we can feel secure strengthened and content never underestimate the importance of a positive atmosphere because within it god can produce miraculous results

6066048 so what did you think of the recent appearance of obama and mccain at that evangelical church the other day
6066049 understanding of and knowledge about muslim prisoners was particularly weak and there was insufficient management scrutiny of race issues in general
6066050 these include prisoners who are dangerous but also prisoners who are vulnerable
6066051 inspectors found that there was no evidence of a robust violence reduction strategy which is essential to ensure safety order and control there was little management analysis of data on bullying intimidation or self harm
6066052 high security prisons require constant and vigorous management in order safely to contain and work effectively with their challenging populations
6066053 franklands population had become even more challenging recently with increases in gang affiliations and the arrival of a small number of convicted terrorists
6066054 it is unfortunate that this coincided with the absence of the governor for some months and the resulting drift that was observable at this inspection needs urgently to be reversed
6066055 i am pleased that the chief inspector has acknowledged the excellent multidisciplinary relationships within the dspd unit which deals with some of the most challenging prisoners in the system
6066056 i am concerned about the comments raised on the safety within frankland however this should be seen in the context of franklands extremely challenging population
6066057 a new diversity and safer prisons manager is now in post to ensure a focus on the matters raised by the inspector in relation to anti bullying and diversity
6066058 anne owers is warning of drift in key areas particularly safety
6066059 for prison officers to do their job properly they need assistance and training to understand more about prisoners backgrounds

6066065 it would be unconscionable for anyone to push ahead with the bond vote once they realized it would fall on rosh hashanah
6066066 i called governor corzine and he agreed to meet with jewish leaders from the edison area to realize the extent of their concerns about this use of the electoral process

6066074 eo 047 is undoubtedly an illegal issuance it may have violated other provisions of the local government code the revised penal code the anti graft and corrupt practices act and other pertinent laws issuances rules and regulations on malversation falsification usurpation and other crimes as well
6066075 for the record i am open to the idea however any resolution should be within the bounds of the law
6066076 eo 047 is like the proverbial thief in the night it stole the power to appropriate funds given by the code other pertinent laws issuances rules and regulations to all sanggunians to the exclusion of all local chief executives
6066077 some cheap semblance of support to what is clearly an illegal act
6066078 with illegal fund releases based on eo 047 we can only guess if the general welfare of the residents of iloilo was promoted pursuant to section 16 of the code but we are positive that with the delivery of projects to the barangays based on eo 047 governor tupas and his familys political agenda like a thief of the night is and will certainly be promoted

6066088 i still think that he would just show up at our gate and tell us that he survived
6066089 the navy league flew out via a blackhawk to the uss tarawa on sunday august 17 2008 for a tour
6066090 a lot of what we do in the military these days is humanitarian assistance and disaster relief its important for people to understand that a large percent of the us navy forces are employed year round providing assistance where it is needed the days of cruising the world to project military power went by the wayside with the fall of the soviet union thats not to say we cant project power if necessary but its no longer our focus its important to get people out to see the ships and what we do to levitate fear and build trust i hope your visit demonstrated our impressive capability to provide medical treatment and a warm dry safe place to stay should a natural disaster arise we in the military really appreciate what the navy league represents and the support you provide our sailors the navy leagues around the world always makes us feel welcome when we are thousands of miles away from home

6066172 doctors should discuss what is available and best for the patient but some are tempted subconsciously perhaps to dress up opinion as fact how many surgeons will tell you if a number of their peers dont agree with them that is not to say they dont have your best interests at heart it is just that the solution is preordained the script written when evidence is poor what you get depends upon whom you see so how can you make an informed decision in the absence of information if your doctors do not know what is best how can they advise
6066173 there is a lot of talk about choice on the nhs but my experience as a patient has taught me that the choice you get is a choice of what you are offered if a doctor knows of a better treatment but it is available only in the wicked private sector outside the health service he or she is not supposed to tell you about it on pain of disciplinary action
6066174 looking at what treatments were available i came across a group led by dr dan sterman at the university of pennsylvania working on an experimental method of treating mesothelioma using genetically modified viruses they make the body attack the malignant cells it is unproven and in the early stages of clinical trials but they have had some success in small numbers the science behind it is appealing it does not involve killing healthy cells as with conventional chemotherapy and it does not involve surgery so radical that the surgical team cannot decide which bit of the patient to send to the recovery ward and which to the pathology lab trials of new drugs or therapies might make all the difference to people with a cancer that is difficult to treat so why shouldnt patients in the nhs be able to try such innovative trials in the us or elsewhere if they wish

6066212 astrocyte polarization as opposed to hypertrophy may be due to the fact that t cells engage in a very focused attack and the astrocytes respond in a directed polarized manner we know that the astrocytes respond in this polarized manner but we are continuing to investigate precisely why
6066213 we believe this is part of a defensive astrocyte response that may serve to destroy the attacking t cells
6066214 when a t cell recognizes an astrocyte infected with a virus or identified as a foreign cell it launches an attack in response the astrocyte polarizes toward the t cell and may actually end up engulfing the aggressor if so this could be a novel unique mechanism of defense by brain cells against immune cells

6066283 en el libro y en el film se demuestra que hubo cient ficos comprados durante m s de 20 a os para contar mentiras hoy sabemos que el roundup es cancer geno est claro que en un tiempo ser prohibido como ocurri con tantos productos de monsanto en el pasado el pcb la dioxina entre otros que generaron poluci n en el planeta por cuarenta a os y que finalmente fueron prohibidos el roundup es altamente t xico en la argentina m s de la mitad de las tierras cultivadas son regadas con un producto que no es biodegradable que llega a las napas fre ticas que contamina los suelos al ritmo actual a mediano plazo los suelos ser n inutilizables los ogm manipulados resisten al roundup y lo absorben cuando una madre argentina les da la denominada leche de soja a sus hijos les est dando un producto regado con una sustancia t xica hoy tienen la oportunidad de hacer un balance y sacar conclusiones es lo que deber a hacer el parlamento hoy los productores ya no pueden decir que no saben hoy hay pruebas tenemos los datos sabemos que la soja transg nica va a generar enfermedades y va a disminuir el rendimiento de la tierra en argentina hay que hacer una evaluaci n seria antes de que sea demasiado tarde hay que dejar bien claro que esta empresa no quiere ganarle al hambre sino hacer grandes negocios
6066284 en francia tambi n existe un lobby muy fuerte de los grandes agricultores que militan por la introducci n de los ogm tambi n hay diputados franceses que mienten en la asamblea nacional en defensa de los intereses de estas empresas en francia algunos senadores tuvieron el coraje de denunciar que los legisladores son presionados por monsanto el aspecto esencial de esta disputa es controlar las semillas que son el primer eslab n de la cadena alimentar a lo que le interesa a monsanto es vender el roundup y tener las patentes sobre las semillas para luego cobrar las regal as sobre la producci n ajena hoy en pa ses como la india s lo hay semillas transg nicas monsanto compr todas las empresas semilleras y los campesinos que comienzan a ver los efectos negativos ya no tienen c mo volver atr s peor a n los agricultores deben pagarle regal as a monsanto al utilizar las semillas o les mandan la polic a es un negocio redondo lo mismo intent monsanto en la argentina primero dijeron que no cobrar an regal as pero en 2005 cambiaron el discurso por el de o nos pagan o vamos a un conflicto fuerte
6066285 la pregunta es c mo volver a estos modelos naturales cuando argentina tiene 18 millones de hect reas regadas con roundup
6066286 la prueba est en que con el avance de la soja en la argentina un alto porcentaje de los tambos se est n cerrando por culpa del roundup desperdigado por los pastizales la soja se cultiva cerca de donde pastan los animales una vez que las vacas se alimentan de las hierbas contaminadas con herbicida quedan afuera del proceso de producci n de productos l cteos lo mismo ocurre con la producci n de arroz y lentejas que est n en la base de la cultura alimentaria argentina que tambi n ha disminuido considerablemente sin contar el hecho de las grandes superficies de rboles que fueron arrancados para cultivar soja sobre todo en el norte del pa s todo un desastre ecol gico destinado a producir alimento para vacunos bobinos y pollos de europa

6066365 bisa jadi bahwa dengan adanya shoutbox orang jadi cuma nyapa dan nggak komen sama tulisan kita tapi dari sisi lain coba deh dipikirin juga bahwa untuk beberapa blog comment nya susah banget dibuka jadi kan tanpa shoutbox malah mempersulit
6066366 kalo content blog nya buat didiskusiin dan sharing emang sih shoutbox bikin orang males baca
6066367 kalo menurut saya nggak ada shoutbox itu belum tentu orang baca postingan kita saya sering merhatiin isi comment orang seringkali isinya nggak nyambung dengan tulisan misalnya cuma sekedar hai atau salam kenal aja atau yang lebih parah kasih komentar yang menandakan kalo dia benar benar nggak baca isi tulisan
6066368 ngga perlu tiga hal seperti itu kaleee yang pasti kamu sering blogwalking ngga perlu baca postingan tapi sering comment ngga nyambung juga ngga apa apa tinggalin pesen di shoutbox dan bilang ehhh aku dah update lho mampir dan jangan lupa komennya ya beres deh august 4th 2008 at 5 28 am

6066392 improper ive discussed with others the difficulty of getting traditional publishers to touch anything about adoption that isnt warm happy fuzzy taboo yet the mainstream media has no problem vilifying mothers who get pregnant out of wedlock and ignoring adoptees altogether its all about the almighty dollar and which spin on the truth makes the most money
6066393 t he incorrect records have been flagged so they are never again released
6066394 the brother is black and he cant throw up a fist
6066395 the mainstream media doesnt know how to accommodate coverage of a black presidential candidate they dont know how to reconcile this candidacy with their generally limited knowledge of people of color and black people especially
6066396 contacted birth parent no medical information to update and parent wishes no contact at this time you may try again in 5 years
6066397 i am a birthmother and i have to say that i dont feel that i have a right to keep information regarding my family from the children i placed for adoption i know that some birthparents will never want contact i think they should have that right to say no however not at the expense of the adoptee
6066398 i am shocked and appalled at the experience that you have had with the ci program in illinois i had no idea that the ci interferes with the written correspondence that you have once contact is agreed upon i cannot comprehend that if the parties did not want that information identifying to be communicated then it wouldnt be put in the correspondence the fact that the state feels they need to interfere is incomprehensible to me but looking at it from a money making perspective i get it if they delete any identifying information from the letters then you are completely dependent upon them to continue your search
6066399 most of us were already sadly aware that the internet is teeming with persons anxious to relieve us of our money with the promise of finding our original family
6066400 i signed up with the illinois ci program in 1994 about two years after its inception when i was signing on i was told the beauty of the ci program was that cis had the full power of the courts behind them cis could go where others couldnt the cis could present a court order for information which otherwise would not be given out to adoptees in other words the cis had super powers i fell for it hook line and sinker be very certain of what treatment you can live with before you sign on with the cis ask yourself if you can give up complete control of your search to a third party who is prevented by law from telling you any identifying information about yourself remember your confidential intermediaries will arbitrarily tell you only those facts they want to and they will arbitrarily withhold from you any facts that they want to
6066401 more to the point we were at an age when we were too young to protect our own interests the state as then supposedly acting on our behalf abdicated its duty to some of its most vulnerable citizens obliterating or at minimum confiscating our authentic history and replacing it with what are in so many cases easily proven to be lies then they get us on the back end by leaving us no recourse other than to be forced into chutes like their ci systems in vain attempts to regain the very documentation every other citizen takes for granted
6066402 in any other scenario in this country a person interested in a relationship of any sort with another person makes this known to that person if the recipient of the requested relationship doesnt want the same thing they decline end of story
6066403 how dare you you have no right youre interfering just forget it and move on
6066404 for the records restoring a legal right to adult adoptees
6066405 your birth mother included the first name of your birth father in her letter due to confidentiality issues i was required to redact his name from her letter
6066406 the report was modified before you received it because it contained confidential information that related to your birth mother i am prohibited from sharing that confidential information with you at this time
6066407 your birth mother included the age of your birth grandfather at the time of his death in her letter due to confidentiality issues i was required to redact his age from her letter
6066408 this matter coming on a request for instructions by the confidential intermediary and the court having reviewed the matter considering the respective interests of the parties to the adoption namely the adoptees rights to search for biological relatives as granted by illinois law and the fact that the biological mother was more likely than not advised that her identity would be shielded from disclosure if an adoption ofher child was completed further noting that the parties have undertaken the practice of communicating anonymously which should give the petitioner access to any necessary genetic medical history and if appropriate other information about her biological family finally observing the mothers adamant refusal to share additional information at this time and stating a rational basis for her position it is ordered 1 that the confidential intermediary shall not furnish the petitioner with an unredacted copy of her status report or any additional information concerning the biological mother other than as authorized by her 2 the matter is continued to may 2008 to allow for a search for the biological father
6066409 hi i found some ill laws as of 2000 it says how people are supposed to be able to obtain medical info at all times etc it also says how a person is supposed to sign up with the state registry before even starting a ci search i think some cis arent trained or really know how to handle adoption searches i think if you can request another one i would do that before letting her do a search for your father sounds to me if your mother put identifying info in the letter then she might have wanted contact dont they have forms that are to be filled out for contact so that once that is established the ci steps out of the picture the fact the ci put your info in her letter oooops was she maybe trying to see if she would contact you if she changed her mind this is so maddening frustration has to be awful with this whole thing so i am sending you link which you may have but it has forms you can send for updated medical if its there something isnt right with this whole thing but you knew that
6066410 i am a birthmother and i have to say that i dont feel that i have a right to keep information regarding my family from the children i placed for adoption i know some birthparents never want to be found i do believe that most not all of those birthparents are from a time in this country when pregnancy in unwed parents was very much a social taboo i am hoping we are phasing out of that mindset regarding adoption i do think the willingness to share information should go both ways though i think too many adoptive parents are unwilling to allow information to be shared with the birthparents i think that is equally as inhumane i am sure that if the sharing of information were more relaxed in our country that there could be safeguards put in place with clear consequences for breaking the rules that would safeguard the people in an adoption i know that some birthparents will never want contact i think they should have that right to say no however not at the expense of the adoptee in those cases they should sign something at the tim of adoption that states that they know the adoptee can be given all of the information regarding the brithparents family but the information provided will exclude the information regarding the birthparent who is refusing contact they should have a place where they can keep information updated regarding the adoptees immediate family siblings grandparents etc contact information there should be legal remedies for anyone violating that refusal to consent to contact in the case of birthparents seeking to find their child ren placed for adoption there should be a freedom of information regarding the location and general welfare of that child i think if the child is still underage that the information should be housed within the agency or a designated agency and provided upon request from the birthparent s if those birthparents are able to find the exact location of the child from the information provided and then choose to attempt to make contact with them if the adoption was not to be open and or no agreement for contact while the child ren is a minor they should face legal consequences also if there is a violation by either party ever i think they should be able to revoke their right to this information after a certain number of violations or depending on the degree of the violation however it should not be this difficult to get information i am sure there are lots of issues to be hammered out to make such a huge overhaul in adoption laws but it is worth doing i also think the laws should be federal and not state by state
6066411 i got a call back on may1st from my ci
6066412 the adoption industry has turned me into a vocal advocate for adoptee rights its ironic that if the records werent sealed there wouldnt be people like me publicly questioning the adoption industrys more dubious practice

6066605 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president
6066606 the republicans have taken that first type of patriotism that muscular military rockets red glare type of patriotism and driven that as a wedge against people they see democrats liberals as weak on national security issues

6066618 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6066619 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6066620 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6066621 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6066622 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6066623 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6066624 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6066625 the conventional wisdom is that this election is going to be a referendum on barack obama
6066626 his people are smart enough to realize this doesnt necessarily work to their benefit
6066627 kerry did an effective job of showing that bush didnt deserve to be president
6066628 but none of the above isnt on the ballot and in the end kerry did not give voters enough of a reason to choose him
6066629 its revealing that barack obama attempts to run a campaign under the thin veil of a positive message when he has consistently shown that hes running a negative campaign
6066630 what sen obama is doing is laying out a very clear choice
6066631 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
6066632 since saturday night ive seen a lot of confusion in the younger christian voting bloc because they thought they had figured this thing out
6066633 theres no absolutely right candidate for an evangelical and theres no absolutely wrong candidate theyre both right and theyre both wrong
6066634 to be perceived as authentic on this issue you need to have some grounding in it and usually that grounding is faith
6066635 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6066636 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6066637 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
6066638 would make a fatal mistake to assume that social issues especially abortion are ever off an equally blazing front burner for an inestimable number of social conservatives
6066639 vibrant communities strong economy and a highly educated workforce all the things weve been bragging about for years
6066640 the idea that leaders of this party could meet for four days and have nothing but silence to greet them is unacceptable
6066641 we have a responsibility to speak out we have a right to be heard
6066642 theres a delicate balance between providing a safe and secure event and allowing people their first amendment rights
6066643 i can always sell water and pop sit in the middle and take money from both sides
6066644 people come here a little bit skeptical but leave saying wow
6066645 when that gavel goes down you cannot not have goose bumps
6066646 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president without knowing necessarily what hes doing
6066647 i want somebody who is mad right now that people are losing their jobs and is mad right now that people have see their incomes decline

6066657 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
6066658 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
6066659 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
6066660 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
6066661 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
6066662 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at us 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
6066663 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum

6066669 etwas gesch nt zumindest was die hemdtasche angeht doch mit den
6066670 i agree that theres more to education policy than throwing money at the problem
6066671 but in our state weve been doing good at a lot of things besides throwing money at the problem
6066672 the public school system is doing as much as it can with as little as possible
6066673 i think its very important that we as an appointed board make a strong statement but not confrontational that encourages as strongly as possible the legislature to appropriate as much as money as is required to make sure that education is adequately funded
6066674 theres a certain trust you have with a company in terms of needing to send confidential information so it can be used in generated reports but its with the obligation that that information is kept secure
6066675 review the incident and evaluate our security and policy procedures
6066676 nonetheless we have apologized to our customers for this situation and assured them that access to the information has been closed and that we are working diligently to put in place any needed remedies to make certain this problem does not recur
6066677 its a different field if you will but its no less important
6066678 its a privilege to represent this state particularly we have a great tradition here ted kennedy and going back to john quincy adams
6066679 the fact is john mccain still doesnt think it was a mistake to go to iraq barack obama knows that it was thats judgment
6066680 twelve billion dollars a month a month are being spent in place where there was no al qaida and there were no weapons of mass destruction and the place where there is al qaida and there are weapons of mass destruction pakistan and afghanistan they have ignored sufficiently that its now at great risk
6066681 im smart enough to know that in this new way that congress works you very rarely get the slot where you can bring a bill that has your own name on it to the floor
6066682 usually youre trying to attach something to something else to get it passed
6066683 he tried to represent the party and its unfortunate the republicans find a way to make devils out of heroes
6066684 he has to reach out to our leaders not just the officials in denver
6066685 i cant trust anybody who doesnt have an american name
6066686 we attract people who are willing to dig in the dirt for a living and we attract people who just want to ski on the slopes
6066687 mccains too old and obamas too controversial and he has no experience
6066688 were in a war whether we like it or not and obama has no experience
6066689 i cant wait for us to get out of iraq our troops are just stretched so thin
6066690 we need to find ways to save earth for future generations
6066691 even at 60 a barrel oil will still be profitable
6066692 i get the feeling he doesnt know what hes talking about
6066693 he wants to start offshore drilling i dont know if thats the right thing to do
6066694 its not much a reason to vote for mccain but im just not voting for obama
6066695 im voting for the democratic nominee if hes the nominee

6066698 were very pleased to hear the results of the poll and are heartened to learn that most voters dont buy into the spoiler argument
6066699 we want ohios voters and the rest of the nation to see that we have prepared a transparent process of transporting voting equipment ballots and supplies
6066700 are people going to grumble that they have to change their process this close to the election absolutely
6066701 but i think the secretary made an effort to provide as much flexibility to counties as possible
6066702 this convention in denver is one is which people well known and people not as well known will come together across party lines across geographic divides because they believe in change
6066703 his message all along is that the ideas have to come from the people

6066710 despite a slight chilling effect the types of events you can hold really hasnt changed very much
6066711 its just a question of adhering to the new guidance
6066712 the truth is the ethics changes havent affected our parties very much
6066713 we want to showcase our fine products and be 100 percent within the rules and the law
6066714 if those parties prove to be a problem then we can revisit it when we do the ethics rules next year
6066715 due to the very late end to the primary season
6066716 had the effect of making people more thoughtful and more careful
6066717 but at the end of the day the application and interpretation of those rules may allow a fairly significant amount of entertainment at most of these events

6066722 i set out to prevent an obama presidency from happening
6066723 it ruined my career in the brokerage business and it was a sad story for a lot of people
6066724 i lost my stellar reputation by being associated with the deal
6066725 in this war we must use all assets of national power to keep the pressure on the enemy keep the terrorists on the run and keep the american people safe from harm
6066726 americas future leaders must always remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and that is where americas military must stay
6066727 cannot be won however if we treat terrorism primarily as a matter of law enforcement law enforcement is an essential part of our strategy but our strategy cannot be limited to law enforcement alone
6066728 but eight years later al qaida terrorists came back to finish the job
6066729 what we know is that in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial they are currently in u s prisons incapacitated
6066730 and the fact that the administration has not tried to do that has created a situation where not only have we never actually put many of these folks on trial but we have destroyed our credibility when it comes to rule of law all around the world and given a huge boost to terrorist recruitment in countries that say look this is how the united states treats muslims
6066731 we could have done the exact same thing but done it in a way that was consistent with our laws

6066796 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now

6066842 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
6066843 i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6066844 sen mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues
6066845 for the good of our country i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but that is not what history shows
6066846 a year ago i said that we must take action against bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights and pakistan cannot or will not act
6066847 so for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell sen mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6066848 to what extent im not sure maybe about half of it though would be my guess at this time
6066849 its not a fact and i have to deal with facts
6066850 so i dont want to go ahead and lurch ahead and use the totality of the reserve based on an estimate only cause well get a new estimate in november
6066851 they can be inaccurate both ways so ill reserve judgment as a result of that inaccuracy

6066856 maybe somebody from the county will come by but its very unusual even for candidates from the county or the state
6066857 we have a candidate who might not be a candidate
6066858 because he wasnt a democrat at the time he filed his papers to qualify he is not properly qualified to be a democratic candidate

6066869 no interest in that the reason the legislature gave the executive branch the authority that they did was to be able to avoid that and i think it was very smart

6066873 we have wait lists for services of tens of thousands of people with developmental disabilities people who need subsidized child care people who need substance abuse services

6066887 buchanan avoided income taxes and the manner in which his penthouse was appraised
6066888 that so many questionable activities have not been examined by federal and state regulators
6066889 while congressman buchanan deserves the benefit of the doubt until these allegations are proven true or false it is a sad day when a member of congress does not live up to the laws he took an oath to defend
6066890 but this former co chair of the republican national finance committee

6066970 if two adjoining but separately owned lots are rendered undersized by a zoning ordinance enactment the two properties will not be affected by the ordinance each lot will continue to be a lawful non conforming size for purposes of the zoning ordinance if those two lots later come under common ownership the burden is upon the municipality to prove that the new owner intended to use the two lots as one integrated parcel on the other hand if the same two adjoining lots are under common ownership when a zoning ordinance is passed that renders each property undersized then the two lots are presumed to have merged the burden is on the landowner to rebut the presumption
6066971 section 5 2 b provides that lots held by separate owners on the day the zoning ordinance makes them undersized can continue to be used separately section 5 2 c states on the other hand that lots under common ownership that become undersized by the ordinance merge

6066987 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
6066988 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
6066989 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
6066990 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
6066991 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
6066992 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
6066993 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
6066994 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in the north east of england in particular we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
6066995 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6066996 foreword upon this subject of cancer we do not intend to follow some former conceptions of cancer or its treatment
6066997 our findings suggest that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic may play a role in diabetes
6066998 while prospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal these findings add to the existing concerns about the long term health consequences of low and moderate exposure to inorganic arsenic

6067005 we have to advance the tournament in august because of aiff directives because of the clash in schedule with their local league that started last month and ends early next month mohun bagan east bengal and mohammedan sporting will not take part in the tournament
6067006 as for dempo they dont want any injury to their players before the afc cup so we cant do anything
6067007 they had earlier confirmed participation the aiff had cleared it and sent a request to afc who in turn had to send it to fifa and only after that it goes to the external affairs ministry it takes a lot of time and as the tournament had been advanced by two months the process could not completed
6067008 the development of animal free coating methods for hescs still remains a major challenge due to the complexity of ecms and insufficient knowledge about how hescs control cell cell and cell ecm interactions
6067009 until now it was generally assumed that the hesc colony formation was pivotal for maintaining pluripotency
6067010 but we show that pluripotency can be retained independent of close cell cell contact
6067011 his work is certainly an important step forward in both understanding signal transduction pathways in stem cells and in the development of an improved methodology for culturing stem cells
6067012 we found that the growth of the hescs under this novel culture condition was almost identical to the growth of hescs on matrigel coated culture plates with no compromise in pluripotency
6067013 our research goal is to understand the basic mechanisms underlying unique biological functions of pluripotent stem cells and to translate the obtained knowledge into future medical applications
6067014 our next step is to produce new animal free ips cell lines
6067015 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
6067016 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
6067017 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
6067018 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
6067019 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions
6067020 an amazing resource dr ryan has assembled some of the best experts in the field to guide you in understanding the threat of pandemic influenza and how it can affect you and the people you are responsible for
6067021 vap is a relatively common infection and increasingly one caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria
6067022 there have been many attempts to prevent vap most of which have revolved around modifying hospital practices the silver coated endotracheal tube has an advantage in that it doesnt require any additional effort by nurses therapists and doctors who may already be over burdened
6067023 i think this is just the beginning for this kind of technology
6067024 the silver polymer coating will most likely be applied also to tracheostomy tubes and also become available for use in pediatric medicine in the future we could see other types of coatings with other functions placed on devices that come into contact with the body
6067025 throughout the ages many things have been used as currency livestock grains spices shells beads and now paper
6067026 thousands of cases of west nile virus have been reported worldwide but 80 of infected people dont show any symptoms
6067027 it is important to have highly sensitive and specific tests to diagnose infections and also to help track the ecology and epidemiology of west nile encephalitis
6067028 although the methods developed are for diagnosing west nile virus in horses the procedures can be easily modified to develop new antibody tests for humans and wildlife
6067029 it is essential to test wildlife for infection to determine the ecological and epidemiological aspects of west nile virus infections in nature so that we can try to control the disease by managing mosquito populations
6067030 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
6067031 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
6067032 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
6067033 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies
6067034 impacts on human health in the arctic region havent been determined

6067036 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
6067037 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place
6067038 past studies have compared the behavior of the mutant protein with that of the nonmutant and found very little difference so it was unclear how this small change led to the devastating effects that are seen in wilson disease

6067041 there were some cash dollar shortage fears in the market initially but then state run banks came in which helped the rupee stabilise in the 43 70 to 43 80 range
6067042 there was not much of dollar selling by state run banks but once they were seen in the market sentiment changed however there was demand from importers and oil companies through the day which kept pressure on the rupee
6067043 these results suggest that a portion of corn stover could be harvested for biofuel production without reducing soil organic carbon levels in high yielding systems however since this study did not study the direct impact of stover removal that aspect remains to be evaluated

6067048 the magnitude of the obesity epidemic adds a staggering burden to our current health care system these studies point to the serious potential risks of gi disease for individuals who are overweight or obese
6067049 i believe that this novel signaling behavior could indicate the owls current reproductive status to potential intruders such as other territorial owls or non breeding floaters
6067050 such marking behavior may have been overlooked in birds and i hope that our story will represent the beginning of new and stimulating explorations on other questions and mechanisms in territoriality and social communication
6067051 faeces may represent an ideal substance for marking because it has a minimal energetic cost to the signaler and can continue to indicate possession of a territory when the owner is occupied in activities other than territorial defense
6067052 to obtain stronger evidence on the intriguing idea that eagle owls use faeces and prey feathers to signal current reproduction
6067053 we will need to perform further experimental studies and behavioral observations that examine whether faeces and feathers provoke specific behavioral reactions and what functional significance these behavioral reactions have

6067059 a quick review of the data collected by the keychain with their teen driver provides parents an opportunity to positively reinforce good driving habits or take appropriate action to modify poorer ones
6067060 and it gives teens an opportunity to show they are responsible drivers
6067061 the main focus is that the teenager is aware that their parents will be aware therefore they wont drive recklessly in the first place because they want the car next weekend
6067062 it is a preventative device not a catch you tattle tale device
6067063 in terms of trust yeah weve been asked that question a lot
6067064 weve got to go beyond trust weve got to go to safety we have to save our children parents dont consider reviewing a teens school report card as spying or a breach of the parent teen trust relationship so why worry about a device that reports on their driving performance the consequences of poor driving habits can be fatal by comparison
6067065 it just gives a few pieces of vital information to parents
6067066 liz has had a great influence on me and having a family has really helped my cricket

6067068 ich habe an obama gespendet weil ich so aufgeregt und begeistert war als ich ihn reden h rte
6067069 und wir werden das im licht dieser neuen informationen erneut tun
6067070 ich wollte gestern abend f r mccain spenden aber meine frau hat es mir ausgeredet
6067071 die wahlkampftaktik obama in misskredit zu bringen zahlt sich f r mccain aus
6067072 theres a joke within economics that 40 years from now every economist will be a health care economist because if you simply extrapolate from the current trend the whole economy will be health care
6067073 firstly these are great engines of growth secondly they make us healthy and whats better than that spending on medical research and science by any crass economic calculation has a massive payoff because if you put any value on life for instance if youve medicine that keeps people alive for an extra two years the implicit value of that is great i could easily see some emerging combination of medical science biotechnology and computing as the foundation of much of our economic growth going forward
6067074 i will not play election year politics with the housing crisis i will evaluate everything in terms of whether it might be harmful or helpful to our effort to deal with the crisis we face now i have always been committed to the principle that it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly whether they are big banks or small borrowers government assistance to the banking system should be based solely on preventing systemic risk that would endanger the entire financial system and the economy
6067075 over one years time the mccains pay to their domestic help is just about equal to obamas salary before he became a senator over 200 000 cindy mccain charged 750 000 in wait for it one month obama did make a few million by writing two books not uncommon in publishing at all before that the obamas had just paid off their student loans who will people identify with more the couple who just paid off loans or the couple worth over 100 million i havent even talked about mccains 500 shoes or his nine homes but ill ask you who can more identify with the working women of this great country surely not john mccain the senator whos voted against the minimum wage eight times
6067076 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
6067077 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas

6067139 in this war we must use all assets of national power to keep the pressure on the enemy keep the terrorists on the run and keep the american people safe from harm
6067140 americas future leaders must always remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and that is where americas military must stay
6067141 cannot be won however if we treat terrorism primarily as a matter of law enforcement law enforcement is an essential part of our strategy but our strategy cannot be limited to law enforcement alone
6067142 but eight years later al qaida terrorists came back to finish the job
6067143 what we know is that in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial they are currently in u s prisons incapacitated
6067144 and the fact that the administration has not tried to do that has created a situation where not only have we never actually put many of these folks on trial but we have destroyed our credibility when it comes to rule of law all around the world and given a huge boost to terrorist recruitment in countries that say look this is how the united states treats muslims
6067145 we could have done the exact same thing but done it in a way that was consistent with our laws

6067190 these events will undoubtedly pave the way for greater conflict and disintegration in georgia
6067191 nino burdzhanadze was giving her first televised national address following the resignation of eduard shevardnadze we have managed to overcome the gravest crisis in georgias recent history without shedding a single drop of blood ms burdzhanadze said
6067192 washington and moscow treat the small weak divided caucasian states as mere pawns in a game in which the whole region acts as a gigantic chessboard america makes a move russia responds and the result is a war an assassination an explosion a military coup or a bloodless revolution we are now awaiting the next move in the game we do not know when or where moscow will respond but one thing we do know the losers will be the ordinary people the poor the defenceless
6067193 the russians had changed dramatically along with the balance of power in the region they welcomed the opportunity to drive home the new reality which was that they could invade georgia and the united states and europe could not respond as for risk they did not view the invasion as risky militarily there was no counter economically russia is an energy exporter doing quite well indeed the europeans need russian energy even more than the russians need to sell it to them politically as we shall see the americans needed the russians more than the russians needed the americans moscows calculus was that this was the moment to strike the russians had been building up to it for months and they struck
6067194 the russians knew the united states would denounce their attack this actually plays into russian hands the more vocal senior leaders are the greater the contrast with their inaction and the russians wanted to drive home the idea that american guarantees are empty talk
6067195 theyre not a major power theyre saudi arabia with trees
6067196 lenin stood for the unity of the peoples of the former tsarist empire but it had to be a voluntary unity that is why he insisted from the very beginning on the right to self determination this idea which is frequently misinterpreted to mean a demand for separation is entirely incorrect the bolsheviks did not advocate separation but defended the broadest possible extension of national self determination up to and including separation no one has the right to oblige a people to live within the confines of a state when the majority do not wish to do so but the right to self determination no more implies the demand to separate than the right to divorce means the demand that all couples must separate or that the right to abortion means that all pregnancies must be terminated
6067197 the right of self determination was an important part of lenins programme insofar as it demonstrated clearly to the oppressed workers and peasants especially the latter of poland georgia latvia and the ukraine that the russian workers had no interest in oppressing them and would firmly defend their right to determine their own destiny but this was only half of lenins programme on the national question the other half was equally as important the need to uphold the union of the proletariat above all national linguistic or religious differences as far as the bolshevik party was concerned lenin always opposed any tendency to divide the party and the workers movement in general along national lines
6067198 i declare war to the death of great russian chauvinism
6067199 after the revolution lenin hoped that there could be a voluntary and fraternal union of the peoples of the former tsarist empire in the form of a soviet federation to this end he demanded that the nationalities be treated with extreme sensitivity every manifestation of great russian chauvinism was to be rooted out as a matter of fact for some time after october the word russia disappeared altogether from official documents the official name of the homeland of october was simply the workers state

6067215 we are not fighting to bring down evo morales but on a social question that of pensions for all workers at the national level therefore this cob movement should not be treated as if we were in accord with or complicit with the right we would never do that since the right is neo liberal and we cannot be confused with the all out neo liberal assault which spent over twenty years attacking the people of bolivia
6067216 the oligarchys main ally is evo morales since he defends the landowners and the rich who exploite the workers and pay poverty wages evo should say if he is going to follow the rich or the poor
6067217 our struggle must fight the seat of economic power of the oligarchic landowning minority this means fighting to carry out the agendas of 2003 and 2005 nationalising the multinational firms and taking back the privatised businesses this will strike a fatal blow against the wealthy stop them stealing natural resources generate jobs and help us overcome the poverty which capitalism and neo liberalism have long subjected us to
6067218 cannot be so irresponsible as to dodge this there have been enough deals with the conspirators and saboteurs of the reform process reform must not be an empty slogan but structural change to take back our natural resources which should be extracted by the state under social control nationalising and industrialising our wealth must be our immediate objective experience has shown that only the people with the state can do this

6067243 it seems the prison authorities will transfer mr osanloo to the modaress or masiheh daneshvari hospital from now on
6067244 this change takes place even though labafinejad hospital is a contractor of evin prison and mr osanloos medical records are available there going back several years
6067245 in the occurrence of last july mansour osanloo who was arrested for the last time judiciary authorities had mentioned the possibility of levying additional charges upon him

6067337 instead of acting properly on the reports by play fair which gave clear evidence of the labour violations the ioc simply passed the buck to the beijing organizers leaving the root problems unsolved
6067338 the ioc is out of sync with the spirit of the olympic movement around the world many organizations and individuals have spoken out on dozens of occasions during the past year about the importance of having the ioc deal with these issues the ioc should be a leader not a laggard

6067484 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6067485 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6067486 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
6067487 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
6067488 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
6067489 teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics
6067490 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
6067491 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
6067492 most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment it gets the kids back in class it doesnt disrupt instruction its like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems
6067493 it works on some and it doesnt work on others
6067494 if youre one of the individuals that it does work on yes it will become a deterrent
6067495 i dont think its the schools place to make decisions like that
6067496 im not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either but i feel like if somebody makes that decision it should be the parent
6067497 power is a large factor in total cost of ownership depending on where you are in the world it may be 10 to 30 percent of your datacenter bill

6067522 we know how hard it can be to get young people interested and involved in anti bullying messages and activities but by making our website appealing and interactive we can give young people an opportunity to explore discuss and tackle this important issue by themselves
6067523 it is absolutely crucial to engage with young people using the sorts of web technology they like our new site enables young users to communicate interact and support each other online
6067524 the young people were really keen to have something they could call their own we got them involved by producing a montage of the styles and options of teen shelters available

6067530 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6067531 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6067532 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6067533 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6067534 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them
6067535 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
6067536 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6067537 make no mistake the possession of this imagery ultimately in many cases leads to contact with children which is why we are so concerned about it
6067538 i expect its going to be chaotic in here today
6067539 i woke up and was surprised the storm wasnt as bad as i thought it would be

6067603 yes i think a fact is if you look at a amount of violence we have in games that young people play at 7 8 10 12 15 years of age if you look at a dehumanization if you look at a fact that we refuse to say that we are in fact endowed by our creator that our rights come from god that if you kill somebody youre committing an act of evil

6067611 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies these complications may become more pronounced with time higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
6067612 our findings highlight a risk associated with alcohol dependence in women that is not widely recognised a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
6067613 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing if drinking continues to increase to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6067614 this would help clarify how much of the connection between alcohol dependence and delayed reproduction is due to adverse effects of alcohol on reproductive functioning and how much is due to reproductive problems creating pain and distress that may be self medicated by alcohol

6067627 some people might not like relegation promotion relegation promotion but would you want to be a middlesbrough stuck in mid table every season
6067628 some people would settle for that because it is better for your heart but the highs and lows are what football is all about for me
6067629 i was amused to read davids comments that he would rather his side suffered relegation every other season than be like middlesbrough
6067630 david is a good friend but i can only assume relegation has affected his thinking a little
6067631 i seriously doubt boro fans would swap our recent histories

6067633 in the meantime birmingham have managed a couple of relegations and a lengthy spell in what is now the championship somehow i dont believe even their own supporters would agree their highs and lows have been preferable to ours

6067637 die lui zijn dan opgeleid in conflictbeheersing nou daar was niets van te merken er liep een gigant van een meer rond met zijn hond die man was z agressief dat ik nog dacht straks gaat ie zelf ook bijten
6067638 maar deze affaire vreet wel aan ons drie weken lang zijn we met zon zestig vrijwilligers dag en nacht in touw geweest om weer een mooi volksfeest neer te zetten en dan dit kijk we hoeven echt geen applaus maar een draai om de oren is het andere uiterste

6067640 als je de fout ingaat moet je dat gewoon erkennen en daar consequenties uit trekken dan ben je een vent maar dit gedraai nu roepen ze weer dat er een agente bijna is gewurgd waarom komen ze daar pas na drie dagen mee
6067641 bij mij thuis zijn geen eieren en flessen tegen de ramen gegooid nee nee ik vind het heel kwalijk dat de burgemeester daar wel onder te lijden heeft dat gedrag keur ik af ik wil alleen maar zeggen dat de jongeren wel weten waar ze moeten zijn

6067659 well get others in the neighborhood to drop them too just like we did before we spent over a year on that sucker it may take another year but well get it done
6067660 what was once a nice neighborhood is going downhill because that place is a haven for people who are using drugs
6067661 its scary we have people walking across our property to go in there to do drugs at all hours of the night
6067662 i feel like my safety is really compromised it used to be really short and really pleasant walk back from the train now i dont feel safe
6067663 unless they have a guard 24 hours a day i dont know what they could do other than board up the whole thing
6067664 the owners of the building need to take down that fence
6067665 its not helpful in terms of safety and it provides visual cover for people who are doing illicit things
6067666 i know weve got a lot of the homeless living there

6067725 for her hair is given her for to be wrapped around

6067728 i am ruined for i am a man of unclean lips and i live among a people of unclean lips and my eyes have seen the king the lord almighty
6067729 for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast
6067730 by the word of the lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth
6067731 his lightnings enlightened the world the earth saw and trembled the hills melted like wax at the presence of the lord at the presence of the lord of the whole earth
6067732 let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need
6067733 therefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire
6067734 remember the sabbath day to keep it holy six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work
6067735 if you turn away your foot from the sabbath from trampling on it from doing your pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy day of the lord honorable and shall honor him not doing your own ways nor finding your own pleasure nor speaking your own words then you shall delight yourself in the lord and i will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth and feed you with the heritage of jacob your father the mouth of the lord has spoken
6067736 forsake the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is
6067737 the new earth from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me says the lord
6067738 it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days
6067739 for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and rested on the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
6067740 moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them
6067741 my conscience tells me that i can no longer work on the sabbath day how can we work around this
6067742 blessed are those who do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you

6067756 periodically in our presence julia would go into a trance state of a recurring nature
6067757 mentally troubled individuals often dissociate but julias trances were accompanied by an unusual phenomenon out of her mouth would come various threats taunts and scatological language phrases like leave her alone you idiot shes ours leave you imbecile priest or just leave the tone of this voice differed markedly from julias own and it varied sometimes sounding guttural and vaguely masculine at other points high pitched most of her comments during these trances or at the subsequent exorcisms displayed a marked contempt for anything religious or sacred
6067758 sometimes objects around her would fly off the shelves the rare phenomenon of psychokinesis known to parapsychologists
6067759 julia was also in possession of knowledge of facts and occurrences beyond any possibility of their natural acquisition
6067760 she commonly reported information about the relatives household composition family deaths and illnesses etc of members of our team without ever having observed or been informed about them
6067761 as an example she knew the personality and precise manner of death i e the exact type of cancer of a relative of a team member that no one could conceivably have guessed she once spoke about the strange behavior of some inexplicably frenzied animals beyond her direct observation though residing in another city she commented so those cats really went berserk last night didnt they the morning after two cats in a team members house uncharacteristically had violently attacked each other at about 2 a m
6067762 despite the weather the room where the rite was being conducted grew distinctly cold
6067763 julia at first had gone into a quiet trance like state
6067764 the voices were noticeably attacking in nature and often insolent blasphemous and highly scatological
6067765 julia also exhibited enormous strength despite the religious sisters and three others holding her down with all their might they struggled to restrain her remarkably for about 30 minutes she actually levitated about half a foot in the air
6067766 document a contemporary and clear cut case of demonic possession
6067767 possession is only one and not the most common type of demonic attack possession is very rare though not as exceedingly so as many imagine
6067768 so called oppression or infestation is less rare though hardly frequent either and sometimes more difficult to discern accurately
6067769 go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation 16whoever believes and is baptized will be saved but whoever does not believe will be condemned 17and these signs will accompany those who believe in my name they will drive out demons they will speak in new tongues 18they will pick up snakes with their hands and when they drink deadly poison it will not hurt them at all they will place their hands on sick people and they will get well
6067770 in my name they will drive out demons they will speak in new tongues they will pick up snakes with their hands and when they drink deadly poison it will not hurt them at all they will place their hands on sick people
6067771 and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a

6067773 who does this self righteous legalist think he is coming and talking to us like that why should we allow this false preacher among us any longer to continue to persecute us

6067777 in warrior epic you cannot purchase power or progress the best gear and items can only be obtained by playing the game there is also no exchange of earned items with paid items so anything that a user buys with real cash cannot be obtained with in game currency

6067782 theres ample evidence that he khawaja wanted to be a front line jihadi soldier in afghanistan

6067799 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
6067800 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things

6067814 in the past everyone submitted reams of paper which then had to be manually inputted
6067815 by taking advantage of online technology weve saved hours of work time weve processed 250 percent more applications than we did last year
6067816 we hold monthly meetings to track our goals and make adjustments as needed
6067817 our goals are aggressive and we are independently audited every six months
6067818 we also regularly demonstrate good financial stewardship to funders and stakeholders through our fundraising and stakeholder engagement programs
6067819 weve also established an online presence through popular web sites including youtube facebook and myspace to promote our programs and reinforce our track record
6067820 we are very deliberate about implementing a corporate management style which includes recruiting talent from americas most well run companies
6067821 a diverse group of high level influential executives who have strong ties to the hispanic community
6067822 there is plenty of funding available to nonprofits that see their role as more than embracing a good cause foundations and corporate donors seek nonprofits with good business practices a strong accountable management team the ability to express and quantify their organizational roi and an openness to collaborate with a full range of partners and stakeholders

6067829 its the greatest gift ive ever been given i understand that raising children is universally difficult and that people read an article hoping for something worthwhile in it the truth is i am not on some inside track i have no incredible revelations to share
6067830 confidence intelligence and goodness theres nothing sexier than that combination
6067831 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron

6067833 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
6067834 due sono i principali ostacoli che impediscono lacquisto della conoscenza pratica il pudore che offusca la mente e il timore che per la paura del pericolo distoglie dallazione ora la follia libera magnificamente da questi ostacoli sono pochi i mortali che comprendono quanto sia vantaggioso essere privi di vergogna e sempre osare
6067835 se si scrive cos il dialetto davvero non fa per me perplessa
6067836 tra gli uomini infatti che cosa si fa che non sia pieno di follia compiuto da folli in mezzo ai folli e se uno vuole opporsi da solo al modo di fare di tutti gli conviene imitare timone ed emigrare in qualche solitudine desertica per godersi l da solo la sua sapienza
6067837 i think all of us are aware of the dangers of a loaded firearm in a vehicle

6067842 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
6067843 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6067844 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6067845 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6067846 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6067847 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6067848 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6067849 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6067850 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6067851 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6067852 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6067853 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6067854 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6067855 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6067856 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6067857 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6067858 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6067859 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6067860 this has been an incredible journey an 11 year 1 2 billion project
6067861 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
6067862 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
6067863 im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the bluetooth api
6067864 i wont divulge too many secrets here but well focus on providing simple calling plans integrating all our services into one device with a consistent cross platform interface and making our content and applications mobile
6067865 frankly were in a street fight today for customers in every single aspect of our business from the bells and the satellite guys to the wireless carriers
6067866 its an important innovation a logical business evolution and will maximize the immense power of coxs greatest asset the last mile of our robust broadband network
6067867 the tru2way open cable platform will mean the end of the set top for some consumers
6067868 and new open source applications that tru2way enables will work across every device from any manufacturer further blending the lines between your tv computer and telephone
6067869 being locked to government mandated business practices or chained to programming contract terms set by government arbiters could inflict more harm than good serving only to choke investment and shackling innovation for future generations
6067870 this is an interesting merger in that the new company will be a supplier to all the big mobile companies except motorola
6067871 in a business where scale matters the complementary product portfolios contributed by the parent companies will deliver significant scale and synergies
6067872 here they ericsson are in an instant creating a business with a critical mass and a market leading position within mobile platforms and at the same time focusing on the core operations
6067873 this type of streamlining is of course positive and i dont think we should rule out that we will see more of this
6067874 the transition from mac to mobileme was rockier than we had hoped
6067875 while we are making a lot of improvements the mobileme service is still not up to our standards we are extending subscriptions 60 days free of charge to express appreciation for our members patience as we continue to improve the service
6067876 we have had complaints about connectivity in the netherlands but have not had more complaints than usual for a 3g phone in germany our technicians said today apple has issued a software update but it is too early to tell if the problems are solved
6067877 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6067878 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6067879 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6067880 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6067881 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6067882 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6067883 i just have to tell you that your pins offend me and i want you to take them off
6067884 i dont understand why they would offend you im not offended by your dress
6067885 ill take off my pins if you take off your easter pins and so and so takes off her bunny pins and the muslim lady takes off her veil
6067886 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6067887 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6067888 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6067889 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6067890 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6067891 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6067892 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6067893 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6067894 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6067895 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6067896 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6067897 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6067898 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6067899 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6067900 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6067901 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6067902 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6067903 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6067904 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6067905 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6067906 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6067907 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6067908 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6067909 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6067910 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6067911 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6067912 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6067913 mit vorschl gen aus den 70er jahren des vergangenen jahrhunderts l st man die heutigen mobilit tsprobleme sicher nicht statt eine verkehrspolitik nach dem motto zur ck auf die b ume sollte sich gerade die wiener sp stadtregierung endlich dazu durchringen den ffentlichen verkehr zu attraktivieren verbote und gesetzlich dekretierten verzicht lehnt die vp wien jedenfalls ebenso ab wie das grundlose verteuern des ffentlichen verkehrs ohne ad quate gegenleistungen
6067914 die autofahrerinnen und autofahrer sind in dieser stadt offenbar freiwild die sp wien zockt sie bereits heute massiv ab ob parkpickerl oder parkgeb hren wenn sich jetzt auch noch ein wissenschafter in den dienst der schlechten sache stellt bedeutet das nichts gutes f r wiens autofahrer nach der abschaffung der ringlinien ist dieser knoflacher vorschlag schon der zweite in diesem sommer der bestenfalls als schnapsidee zu bezeichnen ist
6067915 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6067916 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6067917 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6067918 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6067919 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6067920 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6067921 rather than defiling the spirit of the olympics bolt embodied them he cared so little for the pedestrian concept of a world record only for the thrill of olympic gold that he put that world record at risk to celebrate the only success that mattered to him and his country dont blame him for being so far ahead at 85 meters that he could celebrate early surely if anyone in the rest of the field was closer to him he would have dug in again not for any world record but for this olympic ideal costas claims he disrespects bolt did just enough to accomplish what he came to beijing to do win gold in the 100 any effort beyond that punish your enemies would have been the very opposite of the spirit of the games and so everything after that was limited to a celebration of his joy
6067922 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6067923 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6067924 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6067925 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6067926 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6067927 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6067928 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6067929 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6067930 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6067931 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6067932 though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls yet i will rejoice in thelord i will be joyful in god my savior
6067933 though i get paid squat at my job and my kids wreck my house though i cant sleep at night and my family lives across the country though my friends are scattered far away and my life never slows down yet i will rejoice in the lord i will be joyful in god my savior
6067934 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6067935 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6067936 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6067937 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6067938 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6067939 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6067940 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6067941 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6067942 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6067943 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6067944 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6067945 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6067946 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6067947 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6067948 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6067949 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6067950 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6067951 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6067952 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6067953 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6067954 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6067955 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6067956 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6067957 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6067958 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6067959 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6067960 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6067961 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6067962 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6067963 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6067964 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6067965 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6067966 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6067967 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6067968 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6067969 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6067970 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6067971 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6067972 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6067973 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6067974 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6067975 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6067976 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6067977 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6067978 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6067979 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6067980 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6067981 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6067982 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6067983 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6067984 if asked for a story about girls and dolls hers would invariably feature undead girls and evil dolls much to her teachers dismay all efforts to make her produce normal stories failed
6067985 today she continues to spin tales of ghosts and demons and werewolves while safely locked away in her basement writing dungeon
6067986 kelly lives in ontario canada with her husband kids and far too many pets
6067987 in our democratic society the library stands for hope for learning for progress for literacy for self improvement and for civic engagement the library is a symbol of opportunity citizenship equality freedom of speech and freedom of thought and hence is a symbol for democracy itself
6067988 were thrilled to be working with the carnegie corporation of new york and the american library association to honor librarians who play such a vital role in our communities
6067989 what began as a local times initiative in new york city seven years ago has grown to a national awards program and now we are proud to be co presenting the award with the carnegie corporation of new york and the ala
6067990 this award will continue to raise awareness of the valuable contributions of todays librarians and the ways they make a difference in peoples lives and their communities schools and campuses

6068019 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6068020 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6068021 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6068022 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6068023 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6068024 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6068025 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6068026 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6068027 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6068028 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6068029 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6068030 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6068031 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6068032 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6068033 quarterly unit sales of handsets fell to their lowest level since npd begin tracking the category in 2005

6068082 the housefly is one of the most cosmopolitan members of the animal kingdom it flourishes in every land plumping itself down in front of us at table whether we be eating rice in hong kong dhura in egypt macaroni in italy pie in america or tamales in mexico there it sits impertinent and imperturbable taking its toll letting down its long elephant trunk tongue rasping and sucking up such of our meal as fits its needs
6068083 it is while we ourselves are dreaming in the sun by the margin of some pond that these swift children of the air seem but a natural part of the dream yet if we waken to note them more closely we find many things very real to interest us
6068084 aphids seem to be born to serve as food for other creatures they are simply little machines for making sap into honeydew which they produce from the alimentary canal for the delectation of ants they are in fact merely little animated drops of sap on legs
6068085 the ladybird is a beetle its young are very different from the adult in appearance and feed upon plant lice
6068086 the shit that happened to my children im going to get each and everyone of you f ers back do you understand
6068087 everybody who helped contribute to my kids suffering is gonna f ing suffer themselves and their families and their kids
6068088 if i see you come near my house again im going to f ing shoot you
6068089 im not going to be taken lightly you know who this is
6068090 they are taking all my files we didnt do anything against the law did we
6068091 of course we did man we gave jobs to ourselves
6068092 people ask me all the time about my whisper rock type of sound all i can say to them is that the quieter my vocals are the more an audience is apt to listen to the lyrics and when i decide to get loud i do it because the lyric calls for it and if i do it sparingly it means more each time
6068093 this record represents the last two years of my life its about falling in and out of love the world in which i live my friends my family but most of all its a loss of innocence record in writing these songs i am trying to get back to where i started while also growing as an artist simultaneously not a very easy task but one that i will continue to struggle with for the rest of my creative life it helps when people like patty griffin rob schnapf lenny castro and greg leisz jump on board i still cant believe i was fortunate enough to work with them this record is exactly the way i intended it to be and i hope people dig it
6068094 and i probably wont again until its my own as i cannot imagine topping that experience
6068095 a central theme of hope and love for jesus christ
6068096 i was so much more comfortable with this project because id been there done that
6068097 im more settled in my thoughts with my lyrics and with what direction i wanted to go with the music and more importantly my relationship with god has evolved into a place of peace
6068098 i was so much more comfortable with this project because id been there done that
6068099 im more settled in my thoughts with my lyrics and with what direction i wanted to go with the music and more importantly my relationship with god has evolved into a place of peace
6068100 a central theme of hope and love for jesus christ
6068101 it was real tight quarters with all of us in the van
6068102 sometimes the trips were long but mostly i remember how much fun it was
6068103 when i was small i was still a little afraid to go up on the stage but she never seemed to show any fear at all
6068104 a local promoter told us that we were tall and beautiful
6068105 we were at that rebellious stage we were tired of our parents managing us
6068106 you always hear about how tight harmonies can be with siblings
6068107 thats what prince liked about us he just loved how our blend was and how tight our harmony was
6068108 we came from a gospel background and he used to get on us a lot about over singing so i learned how to use volume as a vocal technique and not be so hard hitting all the time
6068109 he showed us how to put parts together in the studio i listened to that and watched him and that helped me to be able to put my own harmonies together now however i do realize that the gift i have comes from god
6068110 we got tired of the hurry up and wait thing
6068111 there were so many uncertainties about our future with prince it was a really confusing and frustrating time and it sent me into a world of depression
6068112 i took time to pray and gospel melodies kept coming up in my heart
6068113 im just really really happy to know god more and in a closer way than ever before its given me that rest that most people are longing for and that im happy to say that i have
6068114 i want stephen harrison in washington with me to fight for the people of staten island and brooklyn he will not be a rubberstamp rather he will truly represent his constituents interests on everything from protecting our country to protecting the rights of working families
6068115 now pac is pleased to endorse steve harrison for the u s house of representatives from new york
6068116 we look forward to voters in staten island and brooklyn sending a strong supporter of womens rights to washington steve has the values we need to improve the lives of women and families in this country

6068122 im in a different phase of my life so there are more happy moments on this album
6068123 darkly introspective is one phrase people have used to describe a lot of my songs there are moody songs but im looking outside myself a little bit more these arent boy meets girl boy leaves girl girl gets bummed out songs theres a lot more than that going on
6068124 im stepping out and writing about things other than unrequited love but because thats not part of my experience anymore
6068125 doesnt mean im going to stop being a songwriter there are plenty of other important things to write about the state of the world for one thing i dont buy into the myth that because you get to a certain level of contentment you have to throw in the towel
6068126 the one thing the songs have in common is directness
6068127 the beauty of country and blues is their simplicity its about getting things across in a really direct way ive spent a while stretching out and going in different directions which is my nature but i feel that i can always embrace that original simplicity again thats why i went back to record circles and xs which i actually wrote back in 1985
6068128 i sometimes say i just started out singing folk songs acoustically by default
6068129 even when i was playing open mic nights by myself id be sitting up on stage with my martin guitar doing angel by jimi hendrix or politician by cream alongside robert johnson and memphis minnie songs it never occurred to me to pick just one style
6068130 i feel that this is the most eclectic record ive ever done and ive always been known for being eclectic
6068131 for this album i was comfortable just letting the songs flow and not worried about being so serious and heavy and having to top myself and i think that shows
6068132 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network
6068133 the apple guys are really smart and they have a beautiful phone
6068134 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6068135 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6068136 this is a planning took where all things are going
6068137 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6068138 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6068139 i had a big big weekend i got married to portia de rossi sorry john stamos this ones taken
6068140 you may notice something different about the way im writing its fancy this is the font i type in now that im married i do a lot of things differently now
6068141 i say i do a lot for example who wants to do pilates i do would you like a mountain dew i do do you know why i pulled you over i do and that was just this morning
6068142 the wedding was everything we hoped it would be i wish i couldve invited all of you but i have some pictures and video i can show you when season 6 starts on september 8 i cant wait to see them too it was a blur see you then
6068143 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6068144 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6068145 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6068146 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6068147 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6068148 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6068149 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6068150 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6068151 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6068152 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6068153 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6068154 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6068155 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
6068156 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
6068157 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
6068158 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
6068159 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
6068160 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
6068161 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
6068162 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
6068163 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
6068164 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
6068165 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
6068166 we are in constant contact with our donors and supporters and it wouldnt be at all surprising if people were soliciting their thoughts about any aspect of the campaign
6068167 are climbing much more rapidly than incomes or the growth in the overall economy
6068168 two thirds of the working age population was uninsured underinsured reported a medical bill problem or did not get needed health care because of cost in 2007
6068169 and this is exactly what a child should be doing for the first few years he should be getting familiar with the real things in his own environment some day he will read about things he cant see how will he conceive of them without the knowledge of common objects in his experience to relate them to some day he will reflect contemplate reason what will he have to think about without a file of knowledge collected and stored in his memory
6068170 this is a workbook it contains specific questions and exercises requiring you to look at certain points in the field guides or to go out and make certain observations as i explain in chapter 2 birding is largely about learning to see and to hear so most of the exercises ask you to look at the birds on a certain plate in the book and see something specific about them
6068171 the haunts of the cricket are usually sunny it digs a little cave beneath a stone or clod in some field where it can have the whole benefit of all the sunshine when it issues from its door
6068172 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6068173 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6068174 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6068175 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6068176 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
6068177 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
6068178 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
6068179 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
6068180 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
6068181 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
6068182 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
6068183 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
6068184 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
6068185 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
6068186 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
6068187 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
6068188 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
6068189 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
6068190 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
6068191 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
6068192 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
6068193 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
6068194 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
6068195 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies
6068196 impacts on human health in the arctic region havent been determined
6068197 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
6068198 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
6068199 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
6068200 this work represents a radical improvement over prior work presented by this firm in incorporating a protective layer that drastically lowers the solar absorptance to an acceptable value
6068201 the variable emittance electrochromic technology is an entirely new technology pioneered by this firm to the best of our knowledge no other group has done any work in this area
6068202 a lot of spacecraft engineers have come to us saying if we had this technology it would give us much greater design freedom for future micro spacecraft
6068203 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6068204 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person

6068228 voor de linkse beweging is geweld als strijdmiddel voor rechtvaardigheid altijd wezenlijk geweest
6068229 acties die de democratie ondermijnen zullen nooit door groenlinks worden gesteund of geaccepteerd mensen die het daarmee oneens zijn horen bij een partij die een ander standpunt heeft
6068230 het is altijd wezenlijk aan de linkse beweging geweest dat ze geweld erkent als een middel in de strijd voor rechtvaardigheid en dat ging niet om een paar vrijblijvende meningen
6068231 mochten dan misschien na ef zijn in hun overtuiging maar ze stonden voor rechtvaardigheid en voor een betere wereld ze waren bereid hun handen uit de mouwen te steken met alle risicos van dien iedereen met een links hart keek daar toen tegenop voor sartre zou duyvendak een held zijn een veteraan
6068232 ja links weet zich kennelijk nog steeds niet tot haar verleden te verhouden
6068233 het verschil tussen links en rechts is ontstaan aan de vooravond van de franse revolutie toen de koningsgezinde regenten tijdens vergaderingen met de koning van oudsher rechts van hun vorst zaten om de stemmen die tegen de monarchie klonken letterlijk en figuurlijk een plaats te geven werd daarvoor een ruimte aan de linkerzijde van de koning gereserveerd de linkerzijde kon daar haar protest legaal kenbaar maken wat aanvankelijk bedoeld was als de incorporatie van de tegenstemmen leidde tot de val van de monarchie links maakte zich met geweld los van de oude wereld om een nieuwe te cre ren
6068234 bij duyvendak zou je als eerste de vraag moeten stellen welk doel diende de inbraak bij het ministerie van economische zaken heeft het de oppositie destijds verder gebracht je zou kunnen zeggen van wel alle media publiceerden destijds probleemloos de informatie die de actie had opgeleverd
6068235 mij valt vooral op hoe massaal de afkeuring nu is van deze actie wij zijn kennelijk niet meer in staat te begrijpen dat dergelijke acties bij een manier van politiek hoorden die eigen was aan links
6068236 of je nu kijkt naar de franse revolutie of naar mei 68 geweld was altijd een mogelijkheid om tegen misstanden te protesteren denk aan daniel marc cohn bendit tegenwoordig fractievoorzitter van de groenen in het europees parlement maar destijds was hij als studentenleider de belangrijkste organisator van de parijse studentenopstand van 1968 hij is groot geworden als actievoerder zat met sartre en andreas baader aan n tafel moet hij zijn positie nu ook opgeven

6068260 rons deep business and financial experience will be of great value to us during a challenging time for the business
6068261 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
6068262 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
6068263 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
6068264 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
6068265 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
6068266 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6068267 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6068268 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6068269 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6068270 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6068271 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6068272 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
6068273 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
6068274 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6068275 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6068276 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6068277 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6068278 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
6068279 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
6068280 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6068281 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6068282 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6068283 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6068284 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6068285 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6068286 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6068287 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6068288 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6068289 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6068290 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6068291 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6068292 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6068293 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
6068294 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades

6068363 careful management and conservation of existing populations of musk oxen and caribou as well as other large herbivores should be a priority in plans to mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystems
6068364 until now these animals seem to have been regarded more as background noise than as an active component of the ecosystems response to warming
6068365 keeping large grazers in the picture will help maintain other components of the arctic as we know it or at least moderate the effects of global warming

6068688 the last campaign a recounting of rfks 1968 presidential campaign as well as matt rendells new history of the tour de france
6068689 how does it feel to no longer be the olympic guy
6068690 mark what do you think of what michael has done
6068691 lopinion selon laquelle le r f rendum en irlande rend la perspective europ enne pour la croatie la serbie ou lukraine impossible est inacceptable
6068692 des dirigeants europ ens ont pos des conditions pour de nouveaux largissements par exemple le pr sident fran ais nous ne poserons jamais de telles conditions
6068693 ce nest pas lukraine ce nest pas la serbie ce nest pas la croatie ou la turquie qui ont tenu un r f rendum avec pour r sultat un non il ne doit pas y avoir de lien quel quil soit entre le trait de lisbonne et un nouvel largissement de lue
6068694 les trois pays deurope occidentales o il y a eu un
6068695 il est temps de porter un regard plus quilibr sur l largissement et sur ce quont t ses contributions
6068696 on continue ratifier en rond et comme si de rien n tait
6068697 rien ne va plus dans le petit monde des dirigeants europ istes
6068698 no cheering in the pressbox the best shooter in the business
6068699 yeah right nicollette said why did it seem that everyone named bay was out to get her
6068700 that bitch hit you on purpose u s softball coach ariel stevenson said as she and the trainer helped katie up
6068701 i know she hasnt walked a batter the entire olympics and now she hits me right in the arm
6068702 well my arm feels like its about to fall off but other than that im ok
6068703 you just going to let their pitcher throw at our batters like that
6068704 funny how everybody speaks english when theyre drinking beer and trying to hook up at night but cant understand anything when its inconvenient stevenson said with disgust
6068705 ok girl rub the arm and take your base at least we finally have a runner now all we have to do is score you
6068706 we have some questions about just what happened to the olympic torch when you disappeared with it in mubai
6068707 retired jerseys the sonics were seattles first major league team and their departure is a blow but given how bad the team had been lately it was almost as if they had been gone for awhile
6068708 yeah right nicollette said why did it seem that everyone named bay was out to get her
6068709 that bitch hit you on purpose u s softball coach ariel stevenson said as she and the trainer helped katie up
6068710 i know she hasnt walked a batter the entire olympics and now she hits me right in the arm
6068711 well my arm feels like its about to fall off but other than that im ok
6068712 you just going to let their pitcher throw at our batters like that
6068713 funny how everybody speaks english when theyre drinking beer and trying to hook up at night but cant understand anything when its inconvenient stevenson said with disgust
6068714 ok girl rub the arm and take your base at least we finally have a runner now all we have to do is score you
6068715 we have some questions about just what happened to the olympic torch when you disappeared with it in mubai
6068716 retired jerseys the sonics were seattles first major league team and their departure is a blow but given how bad the team had been lately it was almost as if they had been gone for awhile
6068717 well have more on the dramatic crackdown in beijing and what it means for the olympics right after this
6068718 so why is it that were always stuck here in state college when our friends are having summer adventures overseas
6068719 by the way if i lose my case could you pay off my share of the 100 million lawsuit
6068720 sure cutie course that depends on whether they let me keep my money and as angry as the team is i wouldnt count on that
6068721 good luck cutie youre going to be fine he lied
6068722 immediately after you banged your head you told the teams trainer that your doctor had warned you that it would be dangerous for you to continue playing football due to previous injuries is that correct
6068723 yes kenan replied his throat feeling as if it were coated with velcro
6068724 this is important so lets get this straight when the team offered you a 50 million contract you already knew that you had a concussion and that your doctor advised you against playing football
6068725 and yet you signed the contract anyway knowing that you would not be able to live up to your part of the bargain doesnt that strike you as slightly fraudulent
6068726 you have to speak nodding your head isnt enough did you knowingly sign a 50 million contract to play football even though a doctor warned you that you should not play football
6068727 we all feel for mr hill but that doesnt alter the fact that he was obligated to inform the team of any pre existing medical issues that might prevent him from playing
6068728 and may i remind you he suffered the injury while playing on your field against your players rather than accusing him of breach of contract you should consider yourselves lucky he doesnt sue you for sending him out onto the field
6068729 so pay up your money and let this man get on with his life
6068730 the injury was almost a year ago he left the hospital on crutches whats he doing in a damn wheelchair
6068731 give me a break if you think these cheap theatrics are going to influence your case you can think again this is absolutely ridiculous
6068732 just calm down theres no need to shout everything is under control
6068733 everythings under control youre gonna pay me 100 million and then well be just fine
6068734 thats all right simeon but let me handle this i would hate to get you riled up and possibly injure your knee any worse than it is all right
6068735 oh it is it is i assure you but perhaps i better let this man explain it
6068736 i cant be out if im touching a base when i get tagged
6068737 i demand to speak to my embassy jill said when the chinese official closed the door to the cramped interrogation room
6068738 ah but would that be the american embassy or the mubai embassy
6068739 it seems you cant decide which country you claim as your own
6068740 im just playing for the mubai team im hardly the only athlete competing for another country
6068741 oh im aware of the practice athletes who arent good enough to earn a spot on their own nation teams sell their services to another weaker country i wonder do you feel pride or shame
6068742 i just like to play ball anywhere and anyway i can and before you get so high and mighty its not like there arent chinese athletes competing for america
6068743 former chinese athletes the official said he took another drag on the cigarette and blew out the smoke jill coughed slightly
6068744 why am i being held anyway if its about the broken furniture in our dorm it was the mens basketball team
6068745 no it is not about the furniture the official replied
6068746 unfortunately for you it is about a far more serious matter he took a final deep drag and put out the cigarette by crushing it against the back of his hand
6068747 what did you do with the olympic torch when you disappeared with it briefly during the relay through dubai and who helped you insert the explosive device
6068748 just hold on a minute the home plate umpire said
6068749 but you cant just let her circle the bases for gods sake we tagged her out seven times already
6068750 so joshs interrogator asked as he paged through a gray folder
6068751 i told you i didnt have anything to do with the torch exploding during the opening ceremony if i had do you think i would have stayed in china any longer than necessary
6068752 who can say what you would do the official said
6068753 you americans are inscrutable but dont you find it an amazing coincidence that your old housemate disappeared with the torch for several hours during its relay through mubai and that both you and her are at the olympics together
6068754 but we arent here together shes playing for the mubai basketball team and im leading a tour group of the olympics what incentive would we have in disrupting the olympics when the only reason were here is to see them or play in them im just a tour guide with a group of sports fans
6068755 then could you please explain your association with this man who is on a worldwide terrorist watch
6068756 i dont know what just happened or how the umpires are going to rule stevenson said
6068757 this is for you sarge she said bursting into tears at the thought of her deceased sergeant
6068758 i wouldnt have had the strength to make it this far without having known you and i sure as hell wouldnt have thought of that
6068759 thought of what the on field reporter asked thrusting a microphone in katies face
6068760 leaving my arm on first base katie said tears streaming down her face
6068761 sarge thats sergeant kent woodway he loved to come up with bizarre sports questions when we were sitting round he base between operations
6068762 i know hes watching this whole thing she said with a gulp
6068763 well i hope its a gold medal the reporter said
6068764 here come the umps now and it looks like theyre ready to make their ruling
6068765 i had that medal in my grasp and then i tripped over my amp shoelace all that work all that running all that sacrifice all those years and it all goes to hell because i didnt tie my goddamn shoelaces
6068766 hey its ok baby higgins said stroking the back of nicollettes head
6068767 i know how hard this is but its all right
6068768 i know i know nicollette said wiping the tears from her cheeks
6068769 but it just feels so bad right now i dont know how i could hurt any more than i do or how it could get any worse
6068770 but youve been randomly selected for drug testing if you could come with me
6068771 do i really have to pee into this cant you just collect my tears
6068772 its just one more test to go along with the hundreds youve taken for athena over the past year just go ahead ill be right here waiting for you
6068773 no cheering in the pressbox the best shooter in the business
6068774 yeah right nicollette said why did it seem that everyone named bay was out to get her
6068775 that bitch hit you on purpose u s softball coach ariel stevenson said as she and the trainer helped katie up
6068776 i know she hasnt walked a batter the entire olympics and now she hits me right in the arm
6068777 well my arm feels like its about to fall off but other than that im ok
6068778 you just going to let their pitcher throw at our batters like that
6068779 funny how everybody speaks english when theyre drinking beer and trying to hook up at night but cant understand anything when its inconvenient stevenson said with disgust
6068780 ok girl rub the arm and take your base at least we finally have a runner now all we have to do is score you
6068781 we have some questions about just what happened to the olympic torch when you disappeared with it in mubai
6068782 things i love in spite of the fact that they are offensive awful terrible and maddening

6068786 die zeit die du f r deine rose verloren hast sie macht deine rose so wichtig
6068787 ich betrachtete im mondlicht diese blasse stirn diese geschlossenen augen diese im winde zitternde haarstr hne und ich sagte mir was ich da sehe ist nur eine h lle das eigentliche ist unsichtbar
6068788 aber du darfst sie nicht vergessen du bist zeitlebens f r das verantwortlich was du dir vertraut gemacht hast du bist f r deine rose verantwortlich
6068789 aber wenn du mich z hmst werden wir einander brauchen du wirst f r mich einzig sein in der welt ich werde f r dich einzig sein in der welt
6068790 aber wenn du mich z hmst wird mein leben wie durchsonnt sein ich werde den klang deines schrittes kennen der sich von allen anderen unterscheidet
6068791 die menschen haben keine zeit mehr irgend etwas kennenzulernen sie kaufen sich alles fertig in den gesch ften aber da es keine kaufl den f r freunde gibt haben die leute keine freunde mehr

6068808 see i told you kent just plays on the internet all day he even said something about that cartoon character tweety
6068809 cleaning up with children around is like shoveling during a blizzard
6068810 the moment a child is born the mother is also born she never existed before the woman existed but the mother never a mother is something absolutely new
6068811 if evolution really works how come mothers only have two hands
6068812 these are all strong women who represent our progressive values
6068813 they are not afraid to stand up and fight for our future and the issues we hold dear such as education civil rights health care and an end to the war in iraq among so many others

6068829 georgia persists on all fronts and at the front line
6068830 it is another example of hateful sexist language being used on the campaign trail and now is our moment to make it clear
6068831 this is about beginning the grinding and painful process of rooting out this kind of hate language and behavior whenever and wherever it exists the democratic leadership have pledged to unhinge our nation from gender bias hate language and misogyny and we are taking them at their word
6068832 it was only two weeks ago that womencount launched our campaign to

6068845 when youre twenty love is like a fever it makes you almost delirious when its over you can hardly remember how it happened fire in the blood how quickly it burns itself out faced with this blaze of dreams and desires i felt so old so cold so wise
6068846 acknowledge that the 2008 democratic primary election exposed pervasive gender bias in the media during the campaign from now on when we see examples of this behavior our party leadership will take immediate and public steps to condemn it
6068847 it was bad enough that these sexist incidents occurred over and over again during the campaign
6068848 but perhaps worse was that no one in the democratic party leadership did anything about it where were they thus our campaign to stop the silence
6068849 we are calling on all democrats no matter who they supported in the primary to stand up against sexism
6068850 this election created a new movement among women in this country we intend to capture that passion and energy and use it to continue the progress that has just been made
6068851 we want the superdelegates to take a long hard look at the electoral map and the primary math
6068852 not only has senator clinton won the popular vote she has won the key states that are crucial to any democrat winning the white house in the fall
6068853 we spoke loud and clear in michigan and florida and our voices must be heard
6068854 its up to you is fighting sexism and gender bias at the top of your list do we need to change the discriminatory nominating process should we turn our attention to electing more women to office womencountpac com
6068855 this historic primary election changed the conversation for women in this country the passion and energy that has been ignited has created a new movement
6068856 to understand the direction were headed think moveon for women
6068857 we are very excited about the amount of support we are receiving from many prominent elected officials and organization leaders
6068858 these officials are as committed as we are to seeing that every vote cast in this election is counted fairly and proportionally they realize how high the stakes are if once again millions of voters feel their votes have been disregarded
6068859 my entire adult life has been dedicated to registering and inspiring young people to get involved and vote this is a logical continuation of that work how can we even think of ignoring 2 4 million voters in an election this close
6068860 we must move away from the dangerous precedent of allowing small groups of people to determine the outcome of elections

6068938 intelligentmirror can be used to create a mirror of static http content on your local network when you download something say a software package from internet it is stored cached on a local machine on your network and subsequent downloads of that particular software package are supplied from the storage cache of the local machine this facilitate the efficient usage of bandwidth and also reduces the average download time intelligentmirror can also do pre fetching of rpm packages from fedora repositories spread all over the world and can also pre populate the local repo with popular packages like mplayer vlc gstreamer which are normally accessed immediately after a fresh install
6068939 think of internet as a hard disk your proxy server as a cache and your intranet as a cpu now whenever your cpu needs to process something it needs data from cache if data is not there in cache itll be fetched from ram and or hard disk intelligentmirror sits on your proxy server and keep caching packages in a browsable manner which can be served via http for subsequent requests

6068967 well you know it was very interesting because at first you know i am not happy about the ways the chinese were treating the tibetans because i dont think anyone should be unkind to anyone else
6068968 basically the same bunch of goons and thugs theyve been for the last fifty years
6068969 my erroneous words and deeds angered and saddened the chinese people and i sincerely apologise for this im willing to participate in any earthquake relief activity and to do my utmost to help chinese people affected by the disaster
6068970 for the families who have lost their loved ones or lost limbs or suffered severe injuries your statement and act has caused extreme emotional distress
6068971 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
6068972 we already have to tell the chinese everywhere we want to be in august and what time we have to provide a list of the guests who will be interviewed and the content of the interview
6068973 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
6068974 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
6068975 recently i have also been advised that some of the ioc officials had negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked if you have been misled by what i have told you about there being free internet access during the games then i apologize
6068976 one of the most important and courageous voices in chinese literature
6068977 the news of the massacre reached me while i was sitting beside him in hospital
6068978 i heard that hundreds perhaps thousands of unarmed students and civilians had been gunned down and crushed by army tanks had i remained in beijing i too might have been among the dead
6068979 the tiananmen tragedy was a defining moment in 20th century history but in china no one is allowed to discuss it remembering has become a crime today the chinese are a people who ask no questions and who have no past they live as in a coma blinded by fear and newfound prosperity through my protagonist dai wei a student lying in a coma after being shot in the tiananmen massacre i was able to write about brutality and injustice but also about the things that make life worth living love hope freedom truth and the quest for the sublime imprisoned in his body for ten years dai wei is forced to turn inwards and confront his past and in doing so becomes freer and more alive than the comatose crowds that surround him the act of remembering gives life its meaning it is an act of defiance against tyranny and death
6068980 what kind of country punishes the victims of a massacre instead of the soldiers who attacked
6068981 the most powerful words written in chinese last year were not by a novelist but an unknown citizen who placed in a sichuan newspaper an ad that simply said respect to the mothers of the victims of 6 4 the young clerk who had approved it for publication hadnt grasped the significance of the date the slip was soon discovered by the authorities and three of the papers editors lost their jobs the chinese people have been denied knowledge of their past and the right to reflect on it large gaps exist in the collective memories of the nation it is the role of chinese novelists poets bloggers and journalists around the world to help fill them
6068982 for years the chinese government has tried to use the olympics to legitimize its illegal occupation of tibet
6068983 at this very moment tibetans are facing the most severe and violent repression they have seen in decades at the hands of the chinese government and we have taken nonviolent action at this critical time to draw the worlds attention to the crisis gripping tibet
6068984 days before the olympic games begin and as all eyes turn to china we appeal to the world to remember that millions of tibetans are crying out for human rights and freedom
6068985 as the chinese leadership prepares its display of grandeur and power in beijing trying to convince the world of its new tolerance and openness it is waging a ruthless campaign of repression inside tibet
6068986 as long as the chinese leadership continues its brutal occupation of tibet and refuses to meaningfully address the issue the chinese government will not gain the international recognition it so desperately craves
6068987 a guide to chinese law for foreigners coming to leaving or staying in china during the olympics

6068998 a tradi o chinesa n o me satisfaz deste ponto de vista n o poss vel encontrar refer ncias liberdade e aos direitos humanos no confucionismo
6068999 quanto mais eu fui lendo quanto mais fui descobrindo que a religi o crist havia contribu do para a moderniza o da sociedade chinesa antes da revolu o de 1949
6069000 ora esta contribui o totalmente ocultada pelos nossos manuais de hist ria oficiais que apresentam o cristianismo como o instrumento do imperialismo ocidental
6069001 que acabei alimentando um dio pela sociedade esta sociedade que se tornara a escrava do poder
6069002 o confucionismo se caracteriza por ser um pensamento da elite
6069003 enquanto o budismo n o aponta outra meta sen o a de tornar se um santo
6069004 foi assim que apazig ei a minha c lera contra o partido comunista
6069005 os comunistas s o pecadores assim como eu mesmo se eles est o a servi o de um sistema que oprime
6069006 ao longo de muitos anos senti me fraco fr gil vazio

6069010 this is an excellent goal for next year at this time
6069011 i get it oprah youre right i totally get it could you please pass the carrots
6069012 whatever you do on the horse you should be able to do on the ground
6069013 i am the only person in the history of the tevis to have bred trained and ridden my own horse and won
6069014 i have won twice and my former wife not only won on my horses but also won the coveted haggin cup which is awarded to the horse with the best conditioning
6069015 so we are taking reservations the cost is 75 for the day and you can contact me at 707 782 0687 for details
6069016 culicoides a tiny fly that many horses are allergic to generally causes problems in the mane and tail area deerflies and horseflies usually cause problems on the sides of the chest and flanks horn flies cause irritation on the ventral midline while black flies and stable flies usually affect the abdomen and legs
6069017 ive been involved in moving our household office kids dogs and of course horses to our new home two hours away in pilot hill ca
6069018 this tragedy was completely avoidable and inexcusable you had 59 belgian draft horses which is an extremely large horse being transported in one truck with one driver on one of the busiest highways in the nation
6069019 they are very convenient but they dont offer the horse any support plus they can slip down or even come partially off during transport which can frighten the horse
6069020 one of the stories i tell myself when i am trying to fall asleep is that i have tried ive tagged along after myself in the pages of my own modern western and every few years is another chapter to the story the myth of the cowboy i chased a dream and it kicked me in the teeth yet i find myself falling for it again and again
6069021 i want to encourage people in this community who may not normally think that they have the time to run for council to reconsider
6069022 i think its important that we have people from all walks of life and that includes people who have businesses who are busy and think they are too busy for council we have people sitting at this table who have jobs who run multiple businesses and still have time to make a contribution to their community
6069023 my greatest concern is we have a good representation of our community and not just people who are looking for jobs if you need a job and you cant find one then this isnt what you should be doing
6069024 anybody running for council has to understand that youre an independent person and you stand up and make all kinds of promises and criticisms of the current council and how much better you would do let me tell you its not as easy as you think it is
6069025 ive listened especially in the last week to a lot of innuendo about this council a lot of mean spirited nasty things have been said in the last week and it bothers me because there isnt one person sitting around this council table that is mean spirited that doesnt care deeply about this community and doesnt think long and hard about the decision that get made
6069026 to the people that ive served with here for three years and we sure dont always agree i have enjoyed working with each and every one of you and disagreeing with each and every one of you
6069027 the laurel packinghouse is an important asset for this city but it is now showing its age
6069028 we are taking the necessary steps to understand exactly which repairs are needed so that the building can be enjoyed for many years to come
6069029 in addition the mechanical electrical and sprinkler systems are nearing the end of their service life the building also needs upgrades to meet current codes for accessibility
6069030 the building has stood for nearly a century and has been well used by the community since the second floor was added 25 years ago we encourage the public to continue to visit the museums
6069031 i think the decision to appeal is shameful to say the least its a complete waste of taxpayers money
6069032 this document is a trust for the benefit of the citizens that this land is to be held not sold in perpetuity for the benefit of citizens and is to be used for municipal purposes so why would the citizens elected officials go to court to have that struck down its just bizarre i dont understand the decision making process at city hall that would do that when i believe the vast majority of citizens simply would like it to be left alone yet the elected officials will not leave it alone
6069033 these include the wetland inventory mapping project sensitive habitat inventory mapping project and the sensitive eco system inventory project
6069034 due to their environmental significance and sensitivity many water based and land based features within the city of kelowna have already been designated as natural environment development permit areas
6069035 overall the proposed amendment would see the removal of 62 properties from the development permit areas while including an additional 686 properties
6069036 the only way this can be stopped is to re open the debate the only way to do that is through a new council
6069037 it will take a new council to defeat this approach
6069038 i feel this should now be in the hands of the electorate which will go to the polls on november 15 and encourage everyone to consider asking every candidate if they will vote to defeat the appeal of the covenant my answer is already that i will
6069039 i continue to support these initiatives of council but to walk proudly in the city of kelowna i cannot defend the approach taken by council today monday i am willing to deal with any of the consequences as a result of this decision and can only apologize to the citizens for not being able to bring forward a different decision than was reached monday
6069040 approximately 1800 new boat slips will be added over the next five years with 1400 of those for private use in addition there are plans for dock storage for 315 boats with the potential for more
6069041 we found 77 what we called points of interest and narrowed that down to 47 those could be anything from a boat launch to a marina to mooring buoys
6069042 i think this re establishes what some of us on city council have been saying for quite a while that we have a major shortage of facilities for boats im kind of shocked about 40 per cent of the people have some sort of boat which is very eye opening
6069043 just thinking of alternative places of storing trailers i think we really need to be out of the box on that there is the notion of valet service
6069044 i think of schools for example and all the parking lots that are vacant in the summertime maybe the school district could make a deal to rent parking lots and putting some money back into the school system
6069045 city council is seeking greater clarity in the judgment the court determined that the covenant is not valid but does exist as a charitable trust
6069046 the city will ask the appeal court to clarify whether it is possible to create a trust under common law
6069047 the city will ask the appeal court to rule on whether a charitable trust can be established when land is not gifted the city purchased the land in 1946
6069048 city council is committed to preserving public ownership and public access to the waterfront land and the city hall site
6069049 in laymans terms that you have numbness on the right side of your leg

6069058 its not the sunscreen itself but how you apply it that is causing the problem if you apply a sunscreen with an spf sun protection factor of say 15 but you dont use enough of it and you dont re apply frequently enough you might actually only have an spf of aboutt 5 or 7 people think they are more protected than they are so they stay in the sun longer
6069059 but im not ready to go yet i dont want to die

6069065 the companys philosophy is to be green conscious and wed like our customers to think that way too
6069066 we maintain that we cannot accept that a sizeable portion of our eu budget be spent on a project which will lead to exploitation and possibly damage maltas most precious national monument when other feasible and simpler alternatives exit
6069067 a project of more reasonable dimensions would also leave funds available for more pressing projects like the restoration of crumbling fort st elmo
6069068 its a monkey its not like it did anything bad
6069069 when we gave gvg they would steadily lose weight and when we took them off gvg they would steadily gain weight
6069070 it was like a roller coaster it was also dose dependent rats given higher doses would lose more weight
6069071 for substance abusers the number one cause of relapse is environmental cues triggers
6069072 a fairly significant proportion of subjects who are obese suffer from something called binge eating disorders they binge eat based on cues they see a cake they smell a hamburger and they crave and they start to eat one of the great things about this drug is it stops this
6069073 most drugs of abuse do the same thing to the brain they increase dopamine gvg can prevent that increase of dopamine
6069074 it was impossible to get any pharmaceutical company interested in pursuing it for an addiction application
6069075 corowares quarterly revenues and gross profit did not meet our expectations as key customers reduced their professional services expenditures in response to changing economic conditions worldwide nonetheless we made considerable progress on bringing general and administrative expenses in line with revenues
6069076 in order to increase revenues gross profit and net income we will focus our sales efforts on corowares core business professional services software development and mobile robotic solutions and will further reduce general and administrative expenses related to rent executive salaries and services that are not essential to driving revenues
6069077 we are extremely pleased to open our first restaurant in new york in the historic brooklyn heights neighborhood this premier location has high volume traffic and meets our demographics which include large daytime populations with administrative and professional concentrations home to the original deli sandwich we are optimistic that our concept will be overwhelmingly accepted in new york and anticipate continued expansion throughout the state with an additional 85 pre sold stores nationwide we look forward to our continued domestic expansion
6069078 we started this business because we were small business owners frustrated with the shopping experience for financial products we wanted to shop in an efficient modern way look at all the options on a website click and begin a relationship but the brokers and salespeople who sell financial products to small businesses werent receptive even websites that promise a comparison shopping experience like buyerzone actually just collect your information and sell it to salespeople who use their same old annoying sales tactics
6069079 with transfs a business owner can shop on their own terms just like they are already used to doing for many products in the consumer realm such as travel and electronics
6069080 we have had a preliminary version of this software in the marketplace for several months the users have been happy receiving multiple bids within 24 hours those who were switching the credit card processor for an already established business saved at least several hundred dollars per month of fees this new version of the software significantly improves the user interface reducing the screens of information the user must enter from seven to three
6069081 we have been tremendously pleased with the caliber of talent and the enthusiasm we have encountered here in brno
6069082 the employees of this office will play a critical role in the future success of the company
6069083 brno boasts several universities capable of training top notch technical experts this talent pool in turn attracts an increasing number of very interesting investments to the area each year solarwinds is definitely one such investment
6069084 the czech republic offers software companies a perfect environment and that is reflected in the increase in it investments mediated by czechinvest for the czech republic in the first half of 2008 the highest amount of new investments came from the it sector surpassing the traditional champions automotive and engineering
6069085 demanding nature of the project with respect to the enterprise
6069086 redstar is very pleased with the aggressive approach taken by gold fields on our carlin trend projects the ground work completed by gold fields including mapping geophysics and trenching has helped define drill targets on the richmond summit and dry gulch properties these two projects are located in close proximity to very large gold deposits within one of the most productive gold trends in the world and they share similar geological characteristics to the mines in the area in the short time since we optioned these projects to gold fields they have quickly moved them to the drill stage
6069087 we believe that our recent work at china has added significantly to the potential value on this deposit the infill drilling has been very successful in confirming the overall grade and carbonate levels while also converting previously defined inferred resources into the measured and indicated categories the extensive metallurgical test work on the sulphides has allowed us to reclassify previously interpreted primary sulphide material into leachable material together these activities have resulted in a significant increase in chinas overall measured and indicated mineral resource our metallurgical test work has also demonstrated outstanding recoveries and a much lower acid consumption profile than that of the nearby franke deposit
6069088 we are currently evaluating various alternatives for bringing the china deposit into production given the current high price for sulphuric acid we are rapidly advancing an assessment of a potential scenario whereby an early china oxide starter pit is combined into the existing franke mine plan in order to significantly reduce our near term acid requirements our ability to do so will depend on a number of factors including the definition of a satisfactory china oxide starter pit ongoing metallurgical studies and an acceptable permitting timeline we will give further guidance as these activities progress resource evaluations continue in parallel on other areas of mineralization on the pelusa property china sur india and japan and we expect to be able to report on this activity during the fourth quarter

6069348 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
6069349 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
6069350 i would have liked to see it go much slower
6069351 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
6069352 those getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk
6069353 you can only study a vaccine for so long before you license and use it in a population where it has enormous value
6069354 our hope and belief is that this is a remarkable vaccine that will have huge impact on women
6069355 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
6069356 some of our provinces are running out of money to provide primary care im not against vaccines but in canada and the u s women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer

6069491 it seems he may have misunderstood the concept behind matsugen its commitment to pure authentic japanese cooking even in warming up the 66 space we adhered to minimalist japanese restaurant design concepts because matsugen is not like any other restaurant in new york city it cant be compared to other restaurants including those in koreatown i love korean food and the hotpot dishes in koreatown but its a whole other cuisine it cant even be categorized with other japanese restaurants in the city there are no jalapenos no california rolls in this style of japanese cooking which the matsushita brothers execute exceptionally well the ingredients shine with clean flavors that come from expert preparations our wagyu beef is carefully sliced for cooking in simmering water shabu shabu style at the table so that our diners can enjoy the meat just after its cooked the housemade ponzu dipping sauce brings out the meats subtle richness its definitely not steak and shouldnt be thought of as such as with the wagyu we source and pay a hefty price for the very best ingredients including the sea urchin we get daily from japan which has a more complex funkier flavor than the california sea urchin most other japanese restaurants serve matsugens dishes are not spicy not aggressively seasoned and theyre not meant to be everything on the menu builds upon the very best of what the matsushita brothers have served in japan i was taken by their cooking when i first ate at their tokyo restaurant years ago and i still am today here in new york i trust that other diners will be too
6069492 i was pleasantly surprised and just about shocked with the quality and the way it looked the flow of it and everything about it

6069592 though we live with thousands of different illnesses we have more in common than not for example illness impacts our families careers finances and daily living to name a few we can all learn from one another and share during this journey
6069593 and frankly people are tired of hearing but you look so good and they want others to know that there is great pain involved despite how well they seem to be holding it all together
6069594 life disrupted getting real about chronic illness in your twenties and thirties
6069595 when you are a young adult people expect you to put in long hours to establish a career to jump into the dating world and to build a life for yourself but they certainly dont expect you to be sick theres no such thing as too young to be sick that is just one of the many reasons why invisible illness week is so important
6069596 he was very clear that he is not currently planning to endorse any candidate in the general election but that he has serious concerns about the state of the presidential debates
6069597 sources at the republican national committee now say theyve been told by mccains aides that the former pennsylvania governor tom ridge is no longer being considered
6069598 well rush has never known to be shy about his giving his opinion and im sure his point of view may be held by other people within the party all i know is that my friend of 25 years john mccain is strongly and forever pro life he also believes that you shouldnt be judgmental on other peoples point of view with regard to this and some other very difficult issues and as i said before i think he will make the right choice for his vice presidential nominee and at the end of the day i think rush and everybody else hopefully can see that theres a clear choice regardless of who the vice presidential candidate a choice that says john mccain is needed now as president of the united states in this perilous time
6069599 why cant he pick a pro choice republican like tom ridge a war hero down the line republican because hes pro choice but you can pick a joe lieberman even though hes pro choice explain
6069600 because if you talk to people like rich lowry of the national review it would shake it all up you would come out and youd say im a one term president it is a coalition ticket were going to shake up and change washington were going to get something done and then turn it back to the republican party
6069601 the lieberman possibility is so serious that state party officials say that they have been asked to check their party rules to see if a non republican can be on the ballot in their states and if he does choose lieberman mccain would promise to serve for only one term
6069602 i think tom ridge is not only not under consideration i dont believe hes ever been based on the republicans i have talked to heres what i think theyre trying to do and again its just a theory but its not a crazy one i think that tom ridge and joe lieberman are people john mccain would love to serve with in the white house but i think hes headed toward picking mitt romney mitt romney is pro life now but hes been pro choice and i think what these consultations are meant to do is to give conservatives a little bit of a scare so when he picks mitt romney people say he was recently pro choice hes flip flopped to this position hes not as solid as we would like to be compared to lieberman and ridge hes going to look very solid on that key issue
6069603 i cant imagine someone like myself giving advice to john mccain as he makes a very critical decision you know marriage is an important decision and when youre the nominee of a party who youre going to get married to as your vp is an important decision hes going to make that all by himself and you know hes done well in making decisions in the past hes surprised people by the kind of decisions hes made and theyve turned out well so you know id tell him just go with your instincts and choose who youre comfortable with
6069604 a couple things about the im not the guy quote i was talking to some folks who know joe biden very very well and said number one notice the big grin on his face when he said it number two if he had been told he wasnt the guy he wouldnt be out golfing hed probably be inside looking inside a little introspective he wouldnt be a happy warrior this was more of a im not the guy like look im not joe biden i might look like joe biden so i think everybody is so jumpy right now you know about this because we have nothing else to be jumpy about
6069605 people like biden know that the first rule of the veepstakes is to not want it too bad not look like youre too hungry you have got to look humble you have got to sit back and wait
6069606 since 1968 its been normal to name your vice presidential running mate the week before or the week of the convention theres only been one instance since then 2004 for the democrats where the vice presidential nominee was named more than eight days before the convention so this is normal whats unusual is the way that the obama campaign has been sort of prepping this thing and sort of building it up
6069607 can you clear the air once and for all here the fact that youre the keynote speaker does that mean youre not a possibility as a vp choice
6069608 i have told the obama campaign early on that the only job im running for this year is senate and i would not want to be considered as a vice presidential candidate i think governor kaine who is still in the running i think hed be a great choice i mean hes someone who has got 20 plus years of public experience both as a city councilmember a mayor a lieutenant governor a governor hes really where the rubber hits the road in terms of delivering government services hes a man of deep faith he served as a missionary in honduras he brings i think a life experience and a level of judgment to the position that quite honestly i think would be a great addition to the obama ticket
6069609 well listen i think that at the end of the day its more about judgment than necessarily experience one could argue that dick cheney had more foreign policy experience than anybody for the top job or second job in the last 20 odd years im not sure that experience translated into good judgment

6069689 having done a degree in media and communications and a certificate in pr practice it is sometimes easy to blur the lines between pr and journalism
6069690 the workshop has helped to address issues related to this it has given practical tips i loved the concept of captains of the pr and media industry facing off and addressing issues that we communications specialists have to deal with
6069691 facts are not checked they are merely opinions the shrinkage of newsrooms and the lack of experience and expertise affects the quality of the end product
6069692 pr practitioners need to be aware of the specific content and style of the different print and electronic media in order to ensure the reporters interest in a story it is critical to build trustworthy relationships with journalists
6069693 further studies into the cellular and molecular processes leading to these changes could have implications for understanding and treating brain infections brain tumors and neurodegenerative disorders
6069694 astrocyte polarization as opposed to hypertrophy may be due to the fact that t cells engage in a very focused attack and the astrocytes respond in a directed polarized manner we know that the astrocytes respond in this polarized manner but we are continuing to investigate precisely why
6069695 we believe this is part of a defensive astrocyte response that may serve to destroy the attacking t cells
6069696 when a t cell recognizes an astrocyte infected with a virus or identified as a foreign cell it launches an attack in response the astrocyte polarizes toward the t cell and may actually end up engulfing the aggressor if so this could be a novel unique mechanism of defense by brain cells against immune cells
6069697 problems with the use and sizing of graduated compression stockings are common throughout the country and this study is one of the first to systematically analyze the problems and recommend ways to improve practice
6069698 based on the study findings we recommend that knee length stockings be the standard length used and that the education of nurses and patients about the proper use of stockings be improved
6069699 a lot can be done to optimize the benefits of graduated compression stockings and minimize adverse effects
6069700 knee length stockings have many practical advantages over thigh length in that they lower the risk of problems and health care costs the improper use and sizing of these stockings and the deficiencies in patient education are important health care issues

6069702 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6069703 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6069704 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6069705 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency

6069710 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6069711 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6069712 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6069713 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6069714 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6069715 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
6069716 a fool is a terrible thing to have around but a fool with energy is a nightmare
6069717 that was not the bill that was presented at the state level
6069718 what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
6069719 the words person human being child and individual shall include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
6069720 occurs as a result of natural or induced labor cesarean section or induced abortion
6069721 would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported
6069722 i dont know whether he is lying or whether he forgot but with his words he is condemning himself
6069723 he voted one way and then covered it up and he has to explain that not just to me but to the american people
6069724 on the childs behalf for damages including costs of care to preserve and protect the life health and safety of the child punitive damages and costs and attorneys fees against a hospital health care facility or health care provider who harms or neglects the child or fails to provide medical care to the child after the childs birth
6069725 i can tell you the sponsors always wanted the entire package of bills which were introduced together and analyzed together
6069726 they never wanted them separated because they wanted to make sure that physicians would be chilled into not performing abortions for fear of going to jail
6069727 but when you take a definition comparable to the federal one and combine it with other provisions that attempt to give full personhood to a fetus that is pre viable and try to put fear of criminal and civil liability in the minds of physicians you have created a much different scenario
6069728 because they interfered negatively with the physician patient relationship attempted to dictate the practice of medicine for neonatal care and greatly expanded civil liability for physicians
6069729 they had sequential numbers but they were not in any way linked to call them a package is a tactic to try to reach out and grab issues in an attempt to divert attention from this one
6069730 the lhc is a discovery machine we dont know what well find
6069731 im actually hoping we find something unexpected that does the job of the higgs
6069732 weve been debating this for 30 years and one way or another the lhc will definitively tell us how electroweak symmetry breaking occurs thats a fundamental advance
6069733 its a tough game you can only do it by statistical analysis since there are other known processes that produce events that can mimic a higgs boson signal
6069734 by itself the higgs is a very puzzling particle so there have been a lot of conjectures about some kind of new physics beyond the standard model supersymmetry has the easiest time fitting in with what we know
6069735 initially well be looking for things that are known standards to make sure that everything is working properly in 2009 we could start really looking for new things like supersymmetry
6069736 these large projects take such a long time we have to start early
6069737 weve been operating it and looking at cosmic ray particles
6069738 nature gives us these cosmic rays for free and theyre the same kinds of particles well see when the machine turns on so it enables us to check out certain aspects of the detector but were very excited to start seeing collisions from the machine
6069739 well be throwing away a lot of data so we have to make sure the triggers are working correctly
6069740 the graduate students and postdocs get to go to geneva but even the undergraduates get a chance to work in a real physics lab and be part of a major international experiment
6069741 there is a high level of interaction and camaraderie between theorists and experimentalists at ucsc which is not the case at other leading institutions
6069742 for me its valuable just in terms of being aware of whats happening on the experimental side
6069743 i got married to sorry john stamos this ones taken
6069744 you may notice something different about the way im writing its fancy this is the font i type in now that im married
6069745 i do a lot of things differently now i say i do a lot for example who wants to do pilates i do would you like a mountain dew i do do you know why i pulled you over i do and that was just this morning
6069746 the wedding was everything we hoped it would be i wish i couldve invited all of you but i have some pictures and video i can show you when season 6 starts on september 8th i cant wait to see them too it was all a blur
6069747 theyre gonna shut it off either pay up or no light
6069748 i was getting breakfast and thought ah i just dont want to talk to her today so i bumped it then two seconds later there was a message from nicole wishing us good luck
6069749 it does go a long way dont worry about that
6069750 she was very surprised that we do have a tradition of naming our boats after her movies and shes just really stoked to be part of a team
6069751 i believe that this novel signaling behavior could indicate the owls current reproductive status to potential intruders such as other territorial owls or non breeding floaters
6069752 such marking behavior may have been overlooked in birds and i hope that our story will represent the beginning of new and stimulating explorations on other questions and mechanisms in territoriality and social communication
6069753 faeces may represent an ideal substance for marking because it has a minimal energetic cost to the signaler and can continue to indicate possession of a territory when the owner is occupied in activities other than territorial defense
6069754 to obtain stronger evidence on the intriguing idea that eagle owls use faeces and prey feathers to signal current reproduction
6069755 we will need to perform further experimental studies and behavioral observations that examine whether faeces and feathers provoke specific behavioral reactions and what functional significance these behavioral reactions have
6069756 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
6069757 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
6069758 electrical energy storage is very important for all electrical and electronic systems
6069759 even renewable energy systems like solar cells need somewhere to store excess energy to be used at night
6069760 traditional materials are ceramic materials which have high weight and are very fragile
6069761 matching the permittivity and uniformly dispersing the ceramic nanoparticles is not easy
6069762 both problems have to be tackled and solved at the same time for the material to have the desired characteristics
6069763 isolated just one milligram a very tiny amount from natural sources that were very difficult to grow
6069764 we needed to develop a concise and efficient synthetic route to make enough largazole for animal studies
6069765 my labs next task was finding the origin of lagarzoles biological activity
6069766 it could be a very good drug candidate for the treatment of various cancers
6069767 if anything the presence of a grandfather was associated with decreased survival of grandchildren
6069768 it doesnt surprise me that men in those societies live longer than men in monogamous societies where they become widowed and have nobody to care for them
6069769 het zal ongeveer een uur duren voor we uitsluitsel hebben we proberen robert toch in die halve eindstrijd te krijgen
6069770 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 an ounce
6069771 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6069772 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6069773 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6069774 whenever a process works at a lower temperature that brings energy savings and cost savings
6069775 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost
6069776 large companies are putting together server farms of tens of thousands of computers even approaching 100 thousand and the big challenge is to interconnect all these computers so that they can talk to each other as quickly as possible without incurring significant costs
6069777 we are proposing a new topology for ethernet data center connectivity
6069778 our work addresses the problem of data center network connectivity in a world where consolidation is increasingly taking place in data centers
6069779 the history of computing and technology has an innumerable set of examples where commodity parts take over the functionality of more specialized pieces of equipment
6069780 but that commoditization hasnt taken place on the communications side so we do have these specialized components still living in the network infrastructure that incur significant costs and complexity
6069781 the other issue is that people are treating the data center as a mini internet
6069782 thats fine but they are then forced to use the same components they might use in the wide area network with a bunch of concerns that dont come up in the data center environment adversarial environments attacks parties that might not trust each other etc so you have a lot of functionalities in these specialized switching components that you really dont need in your data center and you wind up paying for it in dollars and in complexity
6069783 independent of whether our technique is successful or someone elses is five years from now switching and communication infrastructure in the datacenter will be based on these small commodity building blocks
6069784 one of the big benefits of our approach is that it scales trivially to 10 gige at the edge whereas competing techniques rely on aggregation to ever faster links to achieve higher speeds
6069785 if you were to go to 10 gige at the edge for servers today you would need to aggregate to 40 gige or 100 gigelinks moving up the tree topology unfortunately the 40gbps ethernet standard isnt even out yet and when it does become available it will be very expensive because were using identical network elements in our topology today 48 port 10 gige ethernet switches are becoming relatively inexpensive so we would scale trivially to that environment as well
6069786 from a cost perspective to build out a 25 000 node cluster today using current techniques with 100 percent bandwidth just the switching equipment would cost somewhere in the order of 28 million whereas with our technique using the identical network elements would deliver the same performance but incur costs of maybe 4 million thats a factor of seven difference
6069787 going back to the question of 10gige there is no way you could interconnect 25 000 nodes using 10gb ethernet today there just isnt the equipment available for that we could do so at some cost even today but its not insurmountable for somebody who has significant communication and computation needs and the appropriate budget they could use our techniques to deliver 10gige all the way out to the edge servers
6069788 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch
6069789 i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
6069790 donnie wahlberg you know the less attractive wahlberg not hanging so tough with marriage
6069791 its very difficult to be a career person and have a relationship i didnt succeed at doing it at all its incredibly hard
6069792 i think you have to figure out some way of keeping all of those capabilities and requirements in your life in balance
6069793 i just dont feel turning 40 is seminal or major in any way i like my life right now i really like it whatever its taken to get here i appreciate
6069794 one explanation might be that theres a group of consumers thats holding off making do with the devices that they have either because of larger economic concerns or because they dont see any value yet in the new voice and data services that are driving some of these new handsets
6069795 both treasury and the companies are in somewhat of a bind the government is reluctant to intervene and had hoped to reassure markets by asking congress for temporary authority to take an equity stake in the firms or loan them money
6069796 meanwhile freddies ability to raise capital and therefore avoid a bailout is constrained by the uncertainty created by the governments deliberations according to people familiar with the matter
6069797 the companies increasing financing costs tend to push up mortgage rates paid by consumers
6069798 two weeks ago treasury hired investment banking giant morgan stanley to help it
6069799 among the issues being debated is whether to force out management as part of any investment or loan
6069800 some market observers say an investment or a loan from the government will perpetuate a model that no longer works
6069801 the better step would have been to have legislation that would have permitted them to be taken over immediately
6069802 as home prices continue to fall in much of the country the collateral backing loans guaranteed by fannie and freddie is dwindling in value
6069803 one option for both companies is to reduce their purchases of home loans and related securities to conserve capital but that would reduce the flow of money into the market and push interest rates up for consumers perhaps prolonging and deepening the housing slump
6069804 this is a great time to buy blue chip financial firms on the cheap our money will help them absorb write downs and charge offs and then it will be off to the races again for the stocks
6069805 lehman brothers embattled chief executive dick fuld nearly struck a deal to raise almost 5 billion from south korean wealth funds and institutions but the pact disintegrated according to sources familiar with the matter
6069806 its unclear why the deal fell apart earlier this month although one source speculated that lehman was aiming to raise more capital than the korean investor was willing shell out at the time
6069807 the precise terms of the deal could not be learned
6069808 fuld and his newly appointed lieutenant coo and president bart mcdade have been in numerous discussions with prospective investors about raising additional capital internationally
6069809 a jpmorgan chase analyst wrote on monday that lehman may writedown about 4 billion when it reports fiscal third quarter earnings next month

6069837 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl
6069838 i used to hitchhike outside a church every sunday morning waiting for someone to give me a lift to work my family needed the money very much and i couldnt afford to ride a bus but in the end i had to walk the long distance because each week after the service people would come out of church and just drive on by i cant see any difference that jesus made to them
6069839 however i need to make a decision in the next few months as to how i manage that since im running against john mccain which takes a lot of time if women take a moment to realize that on every issue important to women john mccain is not in their corner that would help them get over it
