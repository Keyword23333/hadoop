9360063 what was happening is that the college of education which is the biggest in florida and one of the big ones in the southeast their intellectual energy was really going into the school district

9360068 because my experience has been that medical stimuli conference companies such as these are one in a million sometimes the best of ideas are just not feasible simply because medical stimuli conference consumers like those found on www uiowa edu or www csail mit are not ready for a new paradigm
9360069 winston brinsfield is right about these particular areas of concern but i believe medical stimuli conference business can still move forward and can still burst through any barriers of entry in the respective market take www ftc gov for example this website came out of no where to be considered one of the top 1000 websites on the web today we think that our medical stimuli conference knowledge is superior to all others and with the research skills of piper raiford of www google com we are sure to turn a profit
9360070 we need a few venture capitalists with guts and cash
9360071 i want this medical stimuli conference project to take off and go somewhere and your support in this medical stimuli conference event is a great start

9360076 and we found that those who played using more sophisticated real life like software tended to react more intensely to the act of wagering much like our other patients who were wagering in an actual physical casino
9360077 we found a very different pattern of brain activity when users placed bets at
9360078 of all the sports we observed baseball betting showed the lowest level of brain activity baseball is a much slower and relaxed game so this is expected on the other hand those engaged in showed significantly higher numbers because basketball is a much faster game

9360424 i didnt want to go home and think that i just followed wheels all day i attacked as much as possible and gave it everything columbia just rode a perfect race
9360425 the guys out of the gc were supposed to attack before the finishing circuits so rabon went i actually thought he would be chased down i didnt expect him to be that good
9360426 i told the gc guys barry and pinotti wait wait wait until two and a half laps to go when we got the feeling that everyone was really friggin tired then we started

9360456 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance
9360457 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year
9360458 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9360459 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
9360460 now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education and i will not settle for an america where some kids dont have that chance
9360461 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
9360462 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9360463 you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
9360464 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9360465 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you
9360466 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now
9360467 no matter what we are republican or democratic america needs us to do what all americans have always done in times of disaster and challenge
9360468 we can activate an e mail list of a couple million people who want to give back
9360469 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9360470 a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out whats going on is fine
9360471 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job

9360481 i think there are some advantages to deferring but we have played in an awful lot of games where when we win the toss we take the ball and we have done well in a lot of those games as well
9360482 i dont know if there is anything to getting the ball and having first crack at it or giving it up and having that first possession in the second half
9360483 we feel that with so many levels of judgment that go into the force out call it creates a more consistent play when either you get your feet down for a complete pass or you do not
9360484 please let me out i wont tell anyone ill do whatever you say just dont keep me in the dark where i feel like im going crazy because i cant see anything and it feels like its been days already

9360488 noiseux told us that 10 people singing chant in perfect unison will have a fuller sound than a hesitant group of 40
9360489 its from one of my top 10 favorite albums of all time
9360490 while watching a live video of them performing it it hit me that the melody and lyrics were something id write it fits my personality and seemed like a song that i could put myself into the only way i do covers is to somehow make them my own
9360491 it can certainly throw a spotlight on the bands own songs are they as well written or well put together sometimes thats why bands kind of shy away from doing a cover or they dont do it that often it can become the song everyones waiting to hear some people sort of take the attitude that id rather play our song than someone elses you know
9360492 pats attitude is that youre asking an audience for quite a bit to come in and listen to songs they may have never heard before youve put them through the paces of hearing everything you wrote theres nothing wrong with playing a song they know as long as it doesnt become the song youre known for that can become a problem
9360493 the guys who do that great fill in the blank with your favorite band cover
9360494 its not like a brand you have to carry around with you for the rest of existence
9360495 i dont know if it sums up your whole band it can if you let it but i dont think most bands do that most bands try a song because they love it
9360496 hes got the perfect voice for please come to boston
9360497 remember it now had hoshaw played that song instead of that twilight singers tune the sleepy older crowd would have hoisted him on their shoulders and paraded him around the water lily pond but i told teresa there was no way he would ever cover something so completely unhip
9360498 the status of a song being cool or not doesnt cross my mind ive covered toad the wet sprocket before and thats not cool i just pick songs i like and then work with them a lot of them i scrap because im not adding anything unique

9360573 elective surgery has been abandoned in the central hospitals and even emergency surgery is often dependent on the ability of patients relatives to purchase suture materials from private suppliers
9360574 pharmacies stand empty and ambulances immobilized for want of spare parts this is an unmitigated tragedy scarcely conceivable just a year ago
9360575 the pharmacy may be empty and most equipment out of order but they will be striving to provide some sort of service
9360576 it stands to reason with the way the economy is wed see an increase in need and were seeing it
9360577 just anecdotally i get a lot of my husband just lost his job my company stopped health coverage
9360578 i dont think i would ever move by myself just to make more money
9360579 that there will be a critical personnel shortage is known
9360580 i would never say we have the staffing dilemma fixed
9360581 but we are in a much better position in this community
9360582 the shortage here is more moderate but its still present
9360583 the marketplace has a way so huge deficiencies in a particular job category dont really come about
9360584 thats what were going to see in the next 10 to 15 years
9360585 those continue to just be huge needs for the community
9360586 i dont know that were closer to solving that issue
9360587 weve heard that the need is less intensified people usually continue to nod and say yep were headed in the right direction
9360588 the three hospitals have worked very cooperatively and have been very cordial all three hospitals are doing more than other hospitals in the country to address staffing
9360589 the parties are both working hard to reach out beyond their stables to offer more descriptive representation on the ticket than weve seen in a long time
9360590 who are the best possible candidates but dont really connect with the average american and this year it seems like theyre going for people who for whatever reason could make that kind of connection
9360591 i dont think were going to go back to 1900 where everybody has to be white and male to run for national office
9360592 the fact that there are all these entry points to a candidate isnt really a solution to the question can i relate enough to that candidate
9360593 what i think youre going to see in this election is a much more accurate reflection of the voting population those who actually go out and vote than perhaps any other time in america
9360594 one way or another were either going to have a president who grew up in hawaii or a vice president who grew up in alaska in the white house how much broader can you get than that

9360606 leisure services invites people to dothan you can go to water world on weekends and look at license plates it gives you an outlet and something to do when you get off work
9360607 you have to do a certain thing at a certain time
9360608 as far as i am concerned team sports and recreational activities are of the utmost importance it gives kids an outlet something they can do thats constructive
9360609 we have one of the better cities for recreation the programs available here we are in the top because of the variety of facilities and the locations
9360610 a lot of parks are way out in other cities nowhere near the main artery of town you go to their facilities and they are nowhere near restaurants or any stores thats a big benefit to us westgate is in the middle of everything
9360611 the club system gives kids an opportunity to build on that skill as far as recreation club programs helps the kids decide what sport they want to get into grow and take it to the next level
9360612 that money turns over at least two and a half times the larger the city the larger the multiplier if we dont do these events and tournaments somebody else will
9360613 today there is travel baseball travel soccer travel volleyball the players are going somewhere why not go to dothan
9360614 we build it and build relationships just because you have it doesnt mean it will get used
9360615 our biggest thing we are selling is soccer fields fishing venues and tennis tournaments
9360616 sports tourism is what is growing you can call it leisure or whatever but parents will travel with their children
9360617 the board understands it may cost 80 000 to bid on an event i have worked in towns where they dont get it people say playing fields are for the community we have had to overcome that we have to explain it to them that outside people will come in and use our facilities and spend their money in our community
9360618 we have become famous for hospitality i have tons of people say compared to where they come from we offer so much more and i love what we are able to provide and we provide those things at a low cost or at no cost taxpayers pick up the tab

9360700 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9360701 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9360702 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9360703 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9360704 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9360705 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9360706 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9360707 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9360708 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9360709 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9360710 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9360711 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9360712 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9360713 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9360714 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9360715 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9360716 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9360717 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9360718 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9360719 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9360720 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale

9360739 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9360740 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni

9360749 in queste ultime settimane ha detto ratzinger al termine della recita dell angelus dal palazzo apostolico di castel gandolfo la cronaca ha registrato laumento degli episodi di immigrazione irregolare dallafrica
9360750 non di rado la traversata del mediterraneo verso il continente europeo visto come un approdo di speranza per sfuggire a situazioni avverse e spesso insostenibili si trasforma in tragedia quella avvenuta qualche giorno ha aggiunto il papa ricordando i recenti casi di sbarco di clandestini che hanno prodotto numerosi morti fa sembra aver superato le precedenti per lalto numero di vittime la migrazione fenomeno presente fin dagli albori della storia dellumanit che da sempre pertanto ha caratterizzato le relazioni tra popoli e nazioni
9360751 lemergenza in cui si trasformata nei nostri tempi tuttavia ci interpella e mentre sollecita la nostra solidariet impone nello stesso tempo efficaci risposte politiche so che molte istanze regionali nazionali e internazionali si stanno occupando della questione della migrazione irregolare ad esse va il mio plauso e il mio incoraggiamento affinch continuino la loro meritevole azione con senso di responsabilit e spirito umanitario
9360752 senso di responsabilit devono mostrare anche i paesi di origine non solo perch si tratta di loro concittadini ha aggiunto benedetto xvi ma anche per rimuovere le cause di migrazione irregolare come pure per stroncare alle radici tutte le forme di criminalit ad essa collegate dal canto loro i paesi europei e comunque quelli meta di immigrazione sono tra laltro chiamati a sviluppare di comune accordo iniziative e strutture sempre pi adeguate alle necessit dei migranti irregolari questi ultimi poi vanno pure sensibilizzati sul valore della propria vita che rappresenta un bene unico sempre prezioso da tutelare di fronte ai gravissimi rischi a cui si espongono nella ricerca di un miglioramento delle loro condizioni e sul dovere della legalit che si impone a tutti
9360753 come padre comune sento il profondo dovere di richiamare lattenzione di tutti sul problema e di chiedere la generosa collaborazione di singoli e di istituzioni per affrontarlo e trovare vie di soluzione il signore ha concluso benedetto xvi ci accompagni e renda fecondi i nostri sforzi

9360757 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9360758 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9360783 predicts that increasing compliance demands are likely to give further impetus to the wave of mergers among smaller firms he draws a parallel with sole practitioner independent financial advisers ifas who struggled to cope with compliance issues on their own when the amount of regulation affecting their practices grew exponentially ifas were either forced to merge outsource compliance at great cost or be roped in as tied agents there are now very few one man band ifas compliance for the legal profession is undoubtedly a resources issue and i am afraid it militates against small businesses and sole practitioners in particular

9360802 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now

9360859 con cada caso denunciado se elabora un informe de valoraci n de riesgo para disponer seg n sea el nivel de riesgo todos los medios de protecci n que se requieran para la protecci n de la v ctima y el seguimiento del caso asimismo y dependiendo de ese factor de riesgo los casos se revisan constantemente
9360860 si se ha valorado un caso con nivel de riesgo bajo el informe se revisa cada 60 d as riesgo medio cada 30 d as un nivel alto cada 7 d as y por ltimo un factor de riesgo extremo se valora cada 72 horas
9360861 esto s lo se refiere a la revisi n de los informes porque los agentes asignados a las upap est n en permanente contacto con las v ctimas y no digamos si los casos han sido valorados con un nivel alto o extremo ya que en tales casos los agentes est n protegiendo a las v ctimas las 24 horas del d a
9360862 tom la iniciativa con el teniente coronel de la comandancia de la guardia civil ricardo arranz de crear una unidad de seguimiento para las v ctimas formada por agentes de este cuerpo aunque la intenci n es crear tres m s sin embargo por la estructura que tiene este instituto armado me consta que en casi todos los puestos ya hay agentes que llevan a cabo el seguimiento de los casos de su zona

9360883 la creaci n e implantaci n de la polic a es un objetivo fundamental de este gobierno pero ahora mismo existen otras prioridades
9360884 el momento pol tico ha permitido tener una mayor a para sacar adelante la ley de la polic a auton mica
9360885 las circunstancias econ micas han cambiado de forma notable y es l gico que nos replanteemos la implantaci n
9360886 se puede reflejar pero a lo mejor no de forma completa es decir si para la creaci n de la polic a canaria hab a que poner 40 200 efectivos pues igual se ponen s lo 40
9360887 en esos casos el ayuntamiento suele establecer alg n tipo de acuerdo con la autoridad portuaria que permita el tr nsito de los veh culos

9360899 calder n dijo que si recibieran una buena oferta me dejar an irme el chelsea ha hecho un gran esfuerzo
9360900 el comportamiento de los dirigentes del chelsea fc que a pesar de conocer perfectamente la decisi n de no traspasar al jugador han continuado realizando gestos y manifestaciones que han llegado al extremo de vender camisetas del jugador a trav s de su web oficial
9360901 todo lo cual no ha hecho sino enturbiar la situaci n y confundir a la opini n p blica
9360902 no hay nada de malo con confirmar p blicamente nuestro inter s por un jugador cuando el club involucrado est bien al tanto ha recibido dos ofertas y est negociando su venta as que refutamos toda cr tica del real madrid
9360903 sobre lo del portal el real sabe que fue un lamentable accidente hecho por una empresa ajena a nosotros el cual fue rectificado apenas nos enteramos y no se vendi una sola camiseta
9360904 mi representante ha ido mil veces a hablar con el club y el club no ha mostrado inter s en que me quedara ahora como el club no ha logrado fichar nada interesa que me quede
9360905 es muy dif cil que el presidente viaje a minesota el lunes

9360916 eso es lo que yo le he o do al presidente l ha dicho que quiere verse en la academia en 2010
9360917 que era gran cr tico de la pol tica colombiana puede estar desde afuera en el rol de supervisor o de la mano de sus seguidores en el poder gui ndolos en su modelo pol tico
9360918 es mucho m s factible que termine dirigiendo alg n partido pol tico o termine definiendo los destinos de alguna agrupaci n pol tica pues as tendr a m s espacio para opinar
9360919 seguramente el presidente ser consultado por organizaciones internacionales tampoco descarto la funci n que alguna vez tuvo l pez michelsen o que ocupe un cargo en la administraci n p blica como el ministerio de defensa
9360920 era presidente para poder tener el privilegio de ser ex presidente
9360921 el presidente tiene ahora un gran capital pol tico lo que no quiere decir que salga electo en 2014 c sar gaviria se gast su capital pol tico buscando la secretar a general de la oea y ahora seg n las encuestas vemos que su favorabilidad ha disminuido considerablemente
9360922 lo que buscamos es blindar la frontera con desarrollo producci n y paz
9360923 me ha dicho que formo parte de la historia y le he contestado que no que l s que es una parte de la historia no yo

9360958 forse risponde ferrari ma non solo lo dimostra una recente indagine della fao negli ultimi 45 anni la dieta mediterranea stata gradualmente abbandonata proprio nei suoi luoghi di origine un vero peccato commenta il professore perch mangiar sano il modo pi efficace per mantenersi in salute

9360990 aber das wollen wir doch fort und fort betonen da eine einzige mit erfolg arbeitende produktivgenossenschaft mehr beweist als alle mi lungenen versuche
9360991 die wirtschaftliche bet tigung des berliner bezirks der arbeiterverbr derung war f r die berliner polizeibeh rde ein strafw rdiges vorgehen auch wird die genauere untersuchung ergeben da die arbeiterverbr derung sich verschiedener gewerbe und gewerbesteuer contraventionen schuldig gemacht hat indem sie eine kattundruckerei eine schneider und schuhmacherwerkstatt und eine seidenwirkerei selbst ndig betrieben hat auch mit dem an und verkauf von waaren ein gewerbe betrieben hat
9360992 es sei brigens gleich hier bemerkt da den zarten keimen der arbeiterassoziationen nicht allzuviel zeit gelassen wurde sich zu entfalten

9360994 der versuch 14 mi lang so gr ndlich da die phantasie louis blancs tot blieb und bisher in frankreich wie im auslande kein denkender mensch darauf verfiel sie wieder zu beleben
9360995 da an eine aristokratische unterst tzung und leitung im sinne unserer association 20 welche alleine diesen mangel bis auf einen gewissen punkt h tte in relativ kurzer zeit ersetzen k nnen nicht zu denken war so blieb nur eine sehr langsame lokale bearbeitung des rohen materials der masse der arbeiter und ein m hsamer aufbau von unten herauf in den lokalvereinen brig

9360998 durch gemeinsame insbesondere finanzielle anstrengungen zur errichtung einer existenzbegr ndenden produktionsst tte zu kommen
9360999 der erstatter dieses gutachtens hat schon in den jahren 1945 und 1946 als generalsekret r des zonenbeirates der britischen zone zust ndige stellen der fl chtlingsl nder mehrfach davor gewarnt produktivgenossenschaften der gesch digten und brigens auch kriegsbesch digten als geeignete unternehmensformen f r gewerbliche gesch digtenunternehmen im sinne von ziffer 17 bis 19 zu f rdern
9361000 sie vermeiden die m ngel der produktionsgenossenschaften 41 jener durchaus ungeeigneten form der selbsthilfeunternehmung die in der geschichte der selbsthilfebewegung eine so unerfreuliche rolle gespielt hat und heute leider wieder spielt und verwirklicht zugleich weitergehend die vorteile die man irrt mlich von dieser verfehlten form immer wieder erwartet hat
9361001 ein solches unternehmen wird von jedem einzelnen mitarbeiter als sein unternehmen empfunden und ist insofern besser als die vielfach angewendete produktivgenossenschaft da es nicht an ihren m ngeln kapital und absatzschwierigkeiten sowie disziplinlosigkeit leidet
9361002 das erscheinen dieser arbeit in ihrer urspr nglichen fassung wurde an der universit t zu k ln verhindert weil dadurch die fr heren gutachterlichen fehlleistungen von weisser und seinen mitarbeitern offenbar geworden w ren

9361004 nur u erst selten gelangt eine produktionsgenossenschaft zur bl te
9361005 man wird dem system das nur scheinbar verwickelt ist nachr hmen k nnen da es in sehr geschickter weise alle die klippen zu umschiffen versucht die bisher den industriellen produktivgenossenchaften regelm ig verh ngnisvoll geworden sind
9361006 aber auch diese schlimmste klippe auf der bahn der bisherigen industriellen produktivgenossenschaften will der mild sche plan vermeiden

9361009 die gro en betriebe k nnen hier in der regel unter irgendeiner rechtlichen form faktisch nur produktivgenossenschaften sein

9361014 more than 800 000 people were affected by the disaster about 40 000 were evacuated to safe places
9361015 in addition around 180 000 houses were destroyed three large bridges in sichuans panzhihua city the epicenter of the quake were damaged cracks were found in three reservoirs
9361016 we want to make sure the injury is behind him
9361017 with the way jhonny has been hitting there it doesnt make sense to move him
9361018 thats our best option you dont know what youre going to get thats true but you have talent
9361019 i dont have any reason to doubt that hes going to be ready to go
9361020 hes a 21 year old that we expect to be an important member of this organization this major league team you have to perform at some point you have to perform and it happens to be tuesday against a very good team
9361021 i dont know if you can ever prepare a young man for that
9361022 you can talk about it but that is one of those things that you have to experience
9361023 we dont have a need to bring up an extra outfielder right now
9361024 i will throw changeups more to lefties than to righties
9361025 but basically its the same approach i throw the four seam fastball the two seamer a slider and change to everybody
9361026 i felt like i was overcorrecting just a little bit
9361027 were probably going to add a few players and i think the thing that becomes real important is our bullpen
9361028 weve got guys that have thrown four out of five days and when you can expand your bullpen thats a big help when you can expand a catcher and a pinch runner and some players that can help you late in games thats an advantage for your club
9361029 there are some guys that have played pretty well down there well make some decisions after sundays game and youll see some people in detroit
9361030 were not going to bring up people necessarily just to sit on the bench
9361031 we want people that have earned it and if there is a huge need could you bring up five guys in the bullpen yeah but theyre probably not going to get the work
9361032 they would be getting work if they were in triple a and then if you need them theyre fresh the key is having enough innings to work in and for players to play in they have to field a team as well but if people earn it and we feel that they can help us well bring them up
9361033 everybody down there were going to bring up here if they can help us
9361034 you dont want to bring people up just to check them out right now
9361035 i like a more limited clubhouse this time of year specifically when youre when youre in a playoff hunt so well bring guys up based on our needs
9361036 because when it gets crucial late and you go to run for them and then you put the other catcher into the game and then you go naked after that
9361037 developers tired of fighting bugs in a months old sdk build started asking for a roadmap of future releases not only did google roojs1 working needs some help compressor better than ext
9361038 everybody wants to pitch and get into as many games as you can im no different i want to get out there as much as i can to help the team theres going to be times that you fail and times that you succeed hopefully theres more success than failure
9361039 last year if we had a bad game it would carry over for three four or five games
9361040 this year it never has they understand that you let those go and dont worry about it
9361041 when youve gone through as a team what we went through last year you learn from that
9361042 it would be a shame if we didnt learn from that i think that youve seen an approach that were just grinding out the season grinding out and trying to get as many wins as we can
9361043 with them going through what they did last year and the experience that they were gaining theyve never been through it before you dont know what to expect it makes it hard
9361044 when youre experienced it makes it a lot easier because you understand that you always come out of it they know how to handle it theyve been through it they know the ins and outs of it
9361045 our focus is where it should be on the little things where were focused on one game to win rather than to win a series
9361046 i think that when we dont or have a tough loss i think were recovering faster as a team getting back to just playing our game
9361047 its not the motivation from the article to get miggy back in right away
9361048 even with the article and some misunderstandings there was never any intention of sitting him and letting him die the bottom line is the guy wants to play
9361049 i want to continue to evaluate it because he does have a good tool package and we have seen some flashes of his game management getting better and at times his balance on secondary pitches getting better
9361050 were going to continue to split the playing time up to some degree
9361051 thats worked well but earlier in the season we had success with miggy catching gil a couple of times and its not anything i was really concerned about as far as pitcher catcher matchups
9361052 gils been on a pretty good roll and has a pretty good idea of what he wants to do from game management

9361056 i have enough experience that i can handle whatever situation they throw at me
9361057 as a pitcher it just kind of proves to me i can handle any role thrown at me thats probably the most important thing
9361058 he can be a very valuable guy for us down the stretch
9361059 its just a little more intense in terms of the adrenaline coming out and not knowing when youre going to throw
9361060 its not easy because as you get older sometimes its a little harder on your body that probably makes it a little more of a challenge but i think its the time of year too were getting into september and a lot of us have thrown quite a bit so its just the normal wear and tear that you expect this time of year
9361061 ive hopefully shown teams especially this year that i can pitch in any role
9361062 i wasnt too happy with the month of june and july i thought the first couple of months went good and now ive gotten back to throwing the ball to where i was earlier in the year
9361063 its a different role for me but im just trying to do what i can do
9361064 honestly i couldnt care less about hitting 300 or anything like that
9361065 all i want to do is play hard and have us put together some kind of winning streak to carry into the offseason

9361093 and the stories that mr michel was sharing with us were unbelievable stories of secret submarines and nuclear devices and german rocket scientists that we absolutely had never heard of before
9361094 and immediately found the web page for dr h george mandel
9361095 they showed me around and of course nothing was recognizable
9361096 theres one house still available apparently from that time and all the rest has been demolished
9361097 do you remember about how many americans were stationed at 1142 at that time
9361098 we had 250 german war prisoners underneath they were down underground at fort hunt
9361099 up on this far end was the two taller buildings one of them being the one we billeted in
9361100 well thats what we were hoping you would tell us
9361101 we actually have from veterans a photograph of on the day after the war ended hundreds of documents being burned at 1142
9361102 and it illustrates how critical it is to speak to these gentlemen because who knows what part of the story went up in smoke
9361103 on that same u boat was germanys top rocket scientist wernher von braun
9361104 and i said yeah i speak german like a native
9361105 there was a drug store i went in called the number and they said dean you stay outside and well pick you up in a staff car and they drove me up towards mount vernon and thats how i ended up at fort hunt it must have been end of november early december 1944
9361106 my job was to interrogate scientifically trained and experienced germans who had been sent to this country by the military
9361107 one of them was a person who worked on enriching uranium and i didnt know why anybody would want to enrich uranium i mean what does this have to do with anything
9361108 and so my job was to find out what he was doing and how it was being carried out and then i reported this to the pentagon
9361109 many of the archives were destroyed directly after the war and so if we didnt have the opportunity to speak with these men and capture their stories much of it may have been lost forever
9361110 there were a group of men sitting around a table in a room with great huge recorders recording everything these people said to each other
9361111 and so it sort of threw the prisoners off how did you know this how did you know that my daughter was 17 on march 28th so it really put them at a disadvantage
9361112 i was a pretty good athlete i would do sports with them in order to make them more cooperative i would take some of the people out for dinner at a restaurant in town in civilian clothes
9361113 it took quite some time before he was willing to cooperate the war had ended in europe and at that point he said hes willing to help us but his wife was at that point in what was in the russian zone
9361114 we told the sales person what size and so on and the woman held up a pair of panties

9361116 for 63 years nobody ever said thank you and it was very nice to receive recognition that what we did was being recognized of being helpful to our country
9361117 yes we threatened them with being sent back to russia but there was no other personal harm of any kind and people thought they could be most effective as interrogators by being nice to the people they interrogated

9361122 i was going to ask you what you think regular church going presbyterians can do in regards to all this but listening to you all i think i know because i get the sense that this is all about more than just recycling or changing the type of light bulbs one uses or trying not to drive as much and yet those simple acts can be reminders of whose world this is and of humans place in this world i can see where things like being aware of how your food is raised turning off the ac advocating to save the mountains are ways to be reminded of our interconnection with one another and with all of creation its almost like such practices become prayer bringing humans into communion with the one who created it all and into communion with that creation

9361251 si scaricano sugli italiani tutti i costi agli imprenditori va la polpa e losso rimane ai cittadin ha dichiarato lex sindacalista arrivando al meeting di comunione e liberazione a rimini
9361252 la mia prima priorit ha aggiunto lex leader della cisl capire come verranno sistemati i lavoratori e quali garanzie avranno
9361253 perch il fatto che ci cercano tutti significa che il nostro stato il vero voto utile
9361254 con molta chiarezza spiega pezzotta abbiamo voluto costruire un nuovo soggetto politico quindi autonomo da veltroni e da berlusconi veniamo da una campagna elettorale dove eravamo considerati inutili mentre diventiamo cos solo se adesso ci facciamo catturare da queste sirene al contrario la nostra autonomia che consentendoci di costruire cose nuove ci rende utili
9361255 perch gli elettori ci hanno messo allopposizione e quello facciamo
9361256 unalleanza potrebbe anche essere possibile considerando che tutto dipende dallevolversi della situazione ma proprio non capisco perch ci chiedono di entrare in un partito noi siamo una cosa a parte
9361257 dipende dai programmi non dallalleanza meccanica che si decide a roma perch dove il programma non ci convince non ci si schiera
9361258 a fare unesame di cosa successo fino ad ora e di quali sono le loro responsabilit ed i loro errori che a quanto pare stanno per riproporre anche alleuropee
9361259 pretendere di imporre a questo paese una sorta di bipartitismo
9361260 considerando spiega pezzotta che le europee sono una sorta di diritto di tribuna e non capisco perch vogliono imporre una legge elettorale che impedisce agli altri di sedersi in tribuna
9361261 non considerarci lunica scelta autonoma ma il rimprovero pi serio a berlusconi confessa lesponente unione di centro che si fatto di tutto per non coinvolgere lopposizione andando avanti secondo la logica dellemergenza a colpi di decreti legge e poi non si pu continuare a pensare che ci sia una sola opposizione a scegliere come unico referente il governo ombra
9361262 visto che noi siamo per il dibattito parlamentare non per delle cose che non sono regolate nemmeno dalla costituzione quello che conta il parlamento
9361263 che va assolutamente riformata tenendo per conto delle esigenze della giustizia stessa e non considerando solo gli interessi dei maggiori ma anche quelli dei minori sono i deboli che vanno tutelati garantendo processi giusti e rapidi
9361264 dove ci guadagnano sempre i poteri forti e chi ci perde sono i 7mila esuberi voglio proprio vedere si domanda ironico lex sindacalista come riescono contemporaneamente a salvare alitalia e a sistemare le ricadute sociali secondo me gli esuberi dovrebbero essere a carico di chi ci guadagna
9361265 il problema vero non pensare quanto si innalzano ma come si garantisce il potere dacquisto soprattutto per le pensioni pi basse lo stesso dicasi per i salari
9361266 perch potrebbe essere il momento di ragionare sullopportunit o meno di pensare ad una qualche forma di salario vitale

9361349 the choices we make in life bring upon a lot of sadness and a lot of hurt and a lot of pain
9361350 alaska needs to be self sufficient instead of relying heavily on federal dollars as the state does today
9361351 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
9361352 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9361353 look at all the good things you have in your life
9361354 when you got back from the therapist hospital doctor did they figure out what triggered your depression
9361355 im willing but i dont know what i can say to help you
9361356 you shouldnt be depressed there are people who have it worse than you
9361357 a solid image of families whose lives are measured in small and large moments sometimes historic sometimes mundane leaves critics with nothing to fight about
9361358 her body language that sparkling smile expressive hand gestures all helped loft her speech to summits of high eloquence as she delivered her crucial headline grabbing message in wave after wave of galvanizing scorn for the politics of john mccain and electrifying support for barack obama
9361359 hillary clintons was a huge speech and i have no doubt that when i reflect on the more impressive convention speeches that ive heard in 30 years this will rank among the most memorable
9361360 in walking through the center from the tennessee delegation down to florida over to new mexico and new york everyone appeared to be ready to work together to win the presidency in 2008
9361361 while he didnt bust out with pie charts and 10 point plans he laid out in no uncertain terms the choice we as americans face this year
9361362 im one of those crazy chicks that wants to see what is actually being said in the speeches not the pundits talking about their impressions of what is being said
9361363 as historic as this event is america is late coming to the party
9361364 the folks ive talked to in denver are coming back with a huge smile on their faces
9361365 so now is the time for presiden barack obama its time we need him the world needs him the politics of business as usual has got to end because its killing us and by us i mean america
9361366 the main thing about clintons speech last night that sticks with me is how very very young we still are as a nation and really how rapidly change happens
9361367 although this campaign wont be easy we could well be on the verge of a political realignment that could last for years
9361368 his choice of 44 year old one term governor is going to make it a lot harder for mccain to effectively hit obama on the whole
9361369 so after criticizing obamas inexperience mccain picks someone with even less experience
9361370 o nce the novelty wears off i dont see women moving en mass to see roe v wade overturned
9361371 w hy has this entire race become about girl parts
9361372 john mccain made a stupefyingly wrong headed strategic mistake today by naming sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate
9361373 its just too effing bad that the job has fallen to the republicans because the democratic party threw women under the bus
9361374 i also think its interesting that this election marks the end of a long line of southern administrations no matter who wins there wont be a southerner among them
9361375 unfortunately this abuse of power stemming from religious fanaticism and closed mindedness continues across the globe in many fashions from shooting up a church to modern day crusades
9361376 lets note that if participation in government health insurance programs have increased that means people cannot afford to pay for private insurance
9361377 crafton is playing around with other peoples money which pretty much disqualifies him from criticizing
9361378 this is quite simply a giant middle finger to every american suffering without health insurance the mccain camp does not think that there is a real problem and intends to do nothing to help correct it
9361379 heres a clue if its too easy and money is involved youre not doing it right

9361520 karena itu barangsiapa di antara kamu hadir di negeri tempat tinggalnya di bulan itu maka hendaklah ia berpuasa pada bulan itu dan barangsiapa sakit atau dalam perjalanan lalu ia berbuka maka wajiblah baginya berpuasa sebanyak hari yang ditinggalkannya itu pada hari hari yang lain
9361521 dan wajib bagi orang orang yang berat menjalankannya jika mereka tidak berpuasa membayar fidyah yaitu memberi makan seorang miskin
9361522 yaitu bagi orang yang telah lanjut usia yang tidak ada harapan kesembuhan kembali kuat
9361523 kami diperintah untuk mengqadha mengganti puasa dan tidak diperintah untuk mengqadha shalat
9361524 ketika darah haidh keluar terdapat darah lain yang juga ikut keluar bagi wanita haidh dimungkinkan berpuasa di luar waktu waktu keluarnya darah haidh dan darah lain yang keluar pada masa haidh maka wanita yang berpuasa dalam keadaan tidak haidh atau tidak keluar darah lainnya bersama haidh adalah puasa yang adil karena tidak ada sesuatu darah pun yang merupakan kekuatan badan yang keluar dari tubuhnya apabila dia berpuasa di saat haidh maka hal ini akan menyebabkan tenaganya menjadi berkurang dan akan lemah oleh karena itu yang adil adalah meninggalkan puasa dan diperintahkan untuk berpuasa selain waktu waktu haidh
9361525 dan masuk dalam pengertian ayat ini adalah wanita hamil dan menyusui apabila keduanya takut atas dirinya atau anaknya
9361526 jika seorang wanita hamil takut atas janinnya maka boleh baginya tidak berpuasa dan mengqadhanya sebanyak puasa yang ditinggalkannya serta memberi makan seorang miskin setiap hari yang ditinggalkannya satu kali 8 ons roti
9361527 berbeda dengan haidh waktunya umum dan tidak menentu tidak mungkin menghindar dari hal hal seperti muntah keluar darah karena luka bisul mimpi basah dan lain sebagainya kejadian kejadian tersebut tidaklah menjadi penghalang untuk tidak berpuasa seperti halnya darah haidh
9361528 there was always a great love there as well as a bit of annoyance
9361529 its like being married you know for that long you just kind of get sick of the other person

9361536 were at the age that we just dont want to argue anymore

9361548 estou ansioso para levar the sims 3 o jogo de nova gera o para pc do selo the sims aos jogadores de todo o mundo em 20 de fevereiro

9361550 ie8 brings some changes that allow much more customization that i think users will be happy with you can unlock the toolbars and drag the ie menu bar to a variety of places in ie8 you can also right click in ie8s menu and choose customize where you can have the refresh and stop buttons moved to the front of the address bar those who also prefer not to have the favorites bar showing will be pleased to know you can turn it off although i dont know why you would want to
9361551 based on our observations of ie7 and ie8 beta 1 usage we learned that roughly 80 of the time peoples destination on the web is a previously visited site in the past people would use their favorites or history or theyd just go through all the steps to navigate to the website again the smart address bar enables you to find favorites and sites in your history by just typing a few letters thats much fewer steps than using the favorites and history center we also added the capability to search the title web address and even folders for those who have organized their favorites
9361552 wed heard from many many users that the find dialog in ie6 and ie7 was always getting in the way making it hard to actually find content on the page so weve added a find bar at the top of the page finally that lets you more easily find content on the page
9361553 copy navigate paste is old accelerators are services that you access directly from the webpage in the context of what youre doing letting you bookmark define email map and more with a simple selection even your search providers are available as accelerators some accelerators provide previews so that you can view the result without having to leave the current webpage clicking on an accelerator opens a new tab with the full result
9361554 in ie8 we make it easier to find sites you might like once you turn on suggested sites ie looks at what sites you visit and then offers recommendations of other similar or related sites right from the favorites bar if you dont have suggested sites on already try it out by going to the favorites center and clicking on the turn on suggested sites button at the bottom of the menu
9361555 the reliability improvements in ie8 beta 2 are big crash recovery is nice but not crashing is even better because in ie8 loosely coupled ie lcie separates the frame the address bar back button etc from the tabs and the tabs mostly from each other crashes are more contained and affect fewer tabs than before we think users will also appreciate having close boxes on all their toolbars so that disabling ones they dont want while leaving the ones they do is easier
9361556 ie8 is more interoperable with other web browsers and web standards the contribution of css 2 1 test cases to the w3c is an important in order to really establish a standard way to assess standards support we think that css 2 1 remains the most important place to deliver excellent interoperability between browsers we think developers will enjoy the improvements to the built in tools as well as the other opportunities to integrate their sites in the users daily life with accelerators and web slices
9361557 sarah palin why mccains pick is an insult to women
9361558 as we discussed a bit at the development call were going to be moving the code freeze for beta 1 to september 30 this schedule adjustment will better allow us to incorporate feedback from the alpha on exciting features like worker threads before beta and adjusts for some of the impact of mu on build and release resources
9361559 alpha 2 builds will be produced using the code from aug 19 as before and we should have a schedule for the build availability and release pretty shortly likely around sept 2 if you made me guess dont make me guess
9361560 any time this time of year you can give guys an extra break its not a bad thing
9361561 youd prefer not to have to do it but youve got to go along with whats happening and adjust to that were going to work around that do the best we can to get guys extra rest
9361562 i would hope that what were doing today puts us in good shape for september thats the purpose of it
9361563 were looking at this over the long haul for the rest of the season whats the best way for us to have an opportunity to win the most games this does it
9361564 hes not in any pain at all his arm feels good
9361565 hes gone through this dead arm period every year for the last four or five years were at a point in time where his arm feels a little bit heavy tired i think everybody goes through that i think as he sees everything coming back hell feel better and hell get back on his stride
9361566 we knew coming in that harden is a guy who hasnt pitched much in the last couple years and we were going to have to watch him
9361567 you could see his velocity was down a little bit the other day he needs some extra days right now this way we can really back him off and get him a good rest hopefully to get him ready to pitch the rest of the season
9361568 its in keeping with his past behavior re wright razko and ayers tha man is a shallow and insincere gasbag at best
9361569 obamas negative campaigning linking mccain to one of the most dislike us presidents ever irks me
9361570 its in keeping with his past behavior re wright razko and ayers tha man is a shallow and insincere gasbag at best

9361572 shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9361573 ian is a very determined guy i love his attitude and what he did at the open that back nine he played with the intention to win and had that emotional feeling
9361574 ive been watching paul play and he has been playing absolutely the best through the summer

9361576 nick rang me after my last round at gleneagles to say that i wasnt going to be one of his picks and i simply wished him all the best
9361577 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9361578 i came here for a stage win and a spell in the lead and thats what ive got
9361579 i would have attacked a little later but another rider charged away so i had no choice but to respond
9361580 the move paid off really well i knew this stage finish was good for me i went for it and i won
9361581 i dont consider myself a favourite here its been a long season for me and i dont want to put myself under pressure here
9361582 im taking this lead on the day by day and then well see what happens in the races first long time trial next wednesday
9361583 this summer in the tour i was too confident after taking an early stage win i dont want to make the same mistake again
9361584 too much information to digest its time for a data diet
9361585 its still strong and i strongly urge everyone to leave
9361586 you need to be getting your butts moving out of new orleans now
9361587 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9361588 theres no reason for anyone to stay in new orleans to ride out this storm we cant stop the damage from happening what we can do is move people out of harms way

9361941 mayor of the tiny alaskan town of wasilla population some 8000 souls madam mayor decided to use tax money to build a fancy expensive sports complex but instead of being honest and buying the land for the complex when it was offered to the town on the cheap she waited till developer gary lundgren bought it then had the gall to seize the land from lundgren through eminent domain of course after it was taken to court the folks of wasilla ended up paying about 1 7 million for land it could have purchased for less than a tenth of that sum the poor folks of wasilla are still paying the price for that little shenanigan in higher taxes and service cutbacks a former beauty queen praising god guns and drilling for oil may excite the religious right and pack them into senator mccains corner but i speculate senator mccains gamble is going to cost the gop more than the white house

9361956 along those lines we have been developing every dc character that we own
9361957 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
9361958 i thought we played pretty well but we had penalties and turned the ball over
9361959 we werent perfect with our execution and i missed a couple of reads other than that i thought we played well it was good to finally get out here and play in front of our fans
9361960 we will not pay for loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by any of the following such loss or damage is excluded regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss
9361961 this city has been hit so badly theyve lost so much and the last thing they have to hold on to is their animal
9361962 i didnt want to just leave him to get hurt like so many did in katrina
9361963 it makes me feel a little safer having him with me
9361964 he gets to ride the bus with us which is good
9361965 its a relief that we didnt have to leave him behind
9361966 i saw the little mermaid when i was nine so it was part of our culture
9361967 i didnt like the idea that mermaids werent supposed to have a soul and humans did
9361968 the sea comes and goes we have to accept that disasters are going to happen
9361969 the sea is so very complicated i thought it would be great to draw it
9361970 animation needs the pencil it needs mans drawing hand i will keep using my pencil as long as i can

9361972 her decision to destroy the cyberbox ends her distinction between inside and out
9361973 i felt i was doing cinema for the first time
9361974 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now
9361975 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of the president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9361976 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9361977 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9361978 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that and is done in a serious way
9361979 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does
9361980 you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9361981 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here its also about making decisions and be targeted in what she thinks she has a great mind and she has a very serious direction in where she goes
9361982 i keep raising the number because it just keeps holding better than expected
9361983 this is kind of an inauspicious end to a really incredible summer
9361984 i had to really play a lot more aggressive than i did in the first set
9361985 it was windy out there and if you just tried to put the ball in there it floats
9361986 she was stronger in the first set so i had to pick it up in the second set and especially in the third
9361987 it would be nice to come back to the number one spot
9361988 it would be great if i can do it we will see what happens
9361989 im getting better each day im improving on my fitness
9361990 my mom told me im losing a little weight im not actually losing weight im just getting firmer
9361991 we want to make it very clear we are pro soldier and anti war
9361992 i can lock up my house and scream about it or i can come here
9361993 this is going to be a very broad inclusive demonstration
9361994 we just really want to encourage people to come out
9361995 explorers dont leave fellow explorers lost we want to find out what happened to our friend and colleague no more and no less
9361996 while i feel hes under our nose here hes in an area thats extremely hard to get to its the vertical terrain its the dark terrain and its the trees the vegetation
9361997 if that aircraft didnt go straight down and kind of angled in under a stand of pine trees its going to take someone physically walking upon that scene to find it
9361998 its hard to believe in this day and age that someone could disappear like this until you go up in an aircraft and look at how rough the terrain is its absolutely amazing
9361999 if we dont find steve fossett people are going to be coming out here for the next 50 years until he is found
9362000 a window unit air conditioner or the size of a shopping cart or a washing machine it could just be scattered debris
9362001 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9362002 i asked her how do you feel about this this is two things you have to do is not only possibly be a vice presidential candidate but also you know listen to worry about your son
9362003 and she looked me square in the eye and she said you know something
9362004 we cant let it go we cant let a country come back in and take it back down to a soviet style government this is democracy and thats what were all about
9362005 the united states is the best at what we do were the ones that give the most and give the earliest every time something happens and id like to continue that and also encourage others to get involved you dont have to cross an ocean to be of help
9362006 my husband was a navy boy his father and mother were in the navy i mean theres nothing elitist about that
9362007 im offended by barack obama saying that about my husband
9362008 the parties are both working hard to reach out beyond their stables to offer more descriptive representation on the ticket than weve seen in a long time
9362009 who are the best possible candidates but dont really connect with the average american and this year it seems like theyre going for people who for whatever reason could make that kind of connection
9362010 i dont think were going to go back to 1900 where everybody has to be white and male to run for national office
9362011 the fact that there are all these entry points to a candidate isnt really a solution to the question can i relate enough to that candidate
9362012 what i think youre going to see in this election is a much more accurate reflection of the voting population those who actually go out and vote than perhaps any other time in america
9362013 one way or another were either going to have a president who grew up in hawaii or a vice president who grew up in alaska in the white house how much broader can you get than that
9362014 the word glacial used to imply that something was very slow
9362015 this new evidence from the past paired with our model for predicting future climate indicates that glacial is anything but slow past icesheets responded quickly to a changing climate hinting at the potential for a similar response in the future
9362016 we have never seen an ice sheet retreat significantly or even disappear before yet this may happen for the greenland icesheet in the coming centuries to millennia
9362017 the new work suggests that future reductions of the greenland ice sheet on the order of one metre 3 25 feet per century are not out of the question
9362018 when he ran out of airspace he landed on top of a tree
9362019 were not talking about a big airplane its a fabric covered plane probably weighs about 1 000 pounds
9362020 the tree person was able to climb the tree and set up some kind of a pulley arrangement where they could remove the people by rope and tackle
9362021 we were trying to survive on just water for the last 10 days but its not enough
9362022 we were trapped with nothing after our houses were swept away
9362023 we have sent packets of rice and sugar to the stranded
9362024 the situation is definitely bad but now the army has joined in and rescue operations will be speeded up
9362025 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9362026 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house

9362029 the army corps of engineers informs me that while the levees are stronger than theyve ever been people across the gulf coast especially in new orleans need to understand that in a storm of this size there are serious risks of significant flooding

9362037 i get asked to review all sorts of crazy personal finance books plans programs and schemes all the time ranging from the reasonable to the completely outlandish for the most part all of these programs share more or less the same content get your spending under control call up your creditors and negotiate lower rates or in some cases a balance reduction adopt a very strong debt repayment plan and kick it in the teeth a few of the programs involve some legal manuevering in which you attempt to buy your bad debt from the creditor and then obviously dismiss it but the legal gamesmanship there is murky dealing with legal nuances that are far from clearly explained this is the meat and potatoes of personal finance and it s pretty much true across the board spend less than you earn and get rid of bad debt and plan for the future most of it boils down to nuances of those two statements earn more spend less pay off debt invest and so on in truth the big difference between most personal finance books programs and other materials is in how they re packaged dave ramsey s stuff is packaged in the guise of a straight talking christian suze orman paints the picture of a successful career woman dispensing this advice jim cramer plays the role of exciting enthusiast david bach plays the role of the friendly teacher who tries to make something complicated into something simple and you also have the people that use other methods to convince you kevin trudeau for instance plays the role of the insider who is letting you in on secrets often making over the top and potentially false claims along the way and that appeals to some people here s the truth almost all of these programs work they all deliver most of the same information they all agree on the basic principles and they all offer a program that will get you into a better financial place the only real difference between most of them is in minor details and in how they re presented that s really it the little details and the presentation
9362038 oh sorry i forgot to tell you theres another list
9362039 too often we are so occupied with the destination we forget the journey

9362042 flatter me and i may not believe you criticize me and i may not like you ignore me and i may not forgive you encourage me and i will not forget you
9362043 to be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best night and day to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting
9362044 i am more convinced that our happiness or our unhappiness depends far more on the way we meet the events of live than on the nature of those events themselves

9362048 im qualifying waren wir nicht da wo wir hingeh rten die pace meines autos war aber so gut dass ich trotzdem meinen zweiten sieg in oschersleben hintereinander feiern konnte der schl ssel war der gute start bei dem alles perfekt gepasst hat
9362049 mein zweiter sieg in der wm elf punkte beim bmw heimspiel und platz sechs in der fahrerwertung das war ein perfektes wochenende f r mich
9362050 tom coronel hat mir das leben schwer gemacht aber ich konnte meine f hrung verteidigen vielen dank an mein team wir haben uns in diesem jahr toll weiterentwickelt
9362051 ich gebe niemals auf und diese einstellung wurde heute belohnt
9362052 aus meiner sicht ging meinem unfall im ersten rennen ein unentschuldbares verhalten eines professionellen rennfahrers voraus entsprechend motiviert war ich f r lauf zwei
9362053 in rennen eins wurde ich nach einem guten start in eine kollision verwickelt dabei wurde meine linke vordere radaufh ngung besch digt der start in den zweiten lauf war erneut klasse schlie lich habe ich mir aber an yvan muller die z hne ausgebissen
9362054 ich freue mich sehr f r f lix der sehr hart an sich gearbeitet hat und heute belohnt wurde
9362055 im zweiten lauf h tte es bei mir f r punkte reichen k nnen aber nach dem startunfall war mein auto nur noch schwierig zu fahren
9362056 ich hatte einen schwierigen start in das erste rennen von oschersleben
9362057 in der ersten kurve bin ich auf der linie geblieben und habe den bremspunkt gut getroffen dann hat mich allerdings nicola angeschubst der seinerseits von einem weiteren auto angesto en worden war das hat mich zur seite geworfen und dabei flog sogar die beifahrert r auf gl cklicherweise hat sie sich aber wieder von alleine geschlossen
9362058 durch diesen vorfall konnte augusto durchschl pfen und in f hrung gehen ich wusste dass ich augusto nicht w rde schnappen k nnen und stellte mich daher auf p2 ein das hat mir gute punkte f r die meisterschaft eingebracht ich freue mich auch sehr f r das team denn wir haben erstmals zwei autos auf das podium in oschersleben gebracht
9362059 im zweiten rennen war noch einiges mehr los in der ersten kurve doch dieses mal ist mir nichts passiert ich bin als vierter durchgekommen und wusste dass ich gen jordi gen anm d red w rde berholen m ssen um sicher auf rang drei zu liegen das ist mir in runde sieben gelungen ich konnte die l cke zu meinen vorderleuten sofort schlie en kam aber nicht mehr an ihnen vorbei
9362060 14 punkte mit nach hause zu nehmen ist eine gro e sache hoffentlich k nnen wir in imola an dieses wochenende ankn pfen
9362061 ich habe nicht erwartet auf das podium zu fahren allerdings haben die ereignisse in den ersten beiden kurven meine chancen auf ein gutes ergebnis dramatisch erh ht und das nach nur wenigen metern
9362062 im vergangenen jahr bin ich als zweiter gestartet und wurde in der gleichen kurve abger umt in diesem jahr hatte ich mehr gl ck ab diesem zeitpunkt habe ich einfach alles gegeben bin erst an monteiro tiago monteiro anm d red und dann an tarquini vorbeigezogen ich wusste dass ich rob nicht w rde einfangen k nnen also habe ich mich nur darauf konzentriert den wagen sicher nach hause zu bringen
9362063 im zweiten lauf hatte ich bereits am start zwei kontakte die haben mit die hintere aufh ngung gebrochen und beendeten mein rennen nach nur drei runden
9362064 beim start des ersten rennens haben mich die beiden seats von monteiro und gen in die zange genommen
9362065 gen hat mich nach au en gedr ckt und ich bin dadurch in rob hineingedonnert rob konnte gl cklicherweise weitermachen aber meine aufh ngung war hin ber sodass ich mein rennen beenden musste im zweiten rennen habe ich alles versucht und konnte einige r nge gutmachen was mir am ende den elften platz einbrachte
9362066 ich habe ein immer besseres gef hl auf dem bike und die ergebnisse untermauern das gut
9362067 haben sich die dinge radikal ver ndert ich habe ein immer besseres gef hl auf dem bike und die ergebnisse untermauern das gut ich hoffe dass ich f r den rest der saison genauso weitermachen kann ich w rde es lieben in jedem grand prix um das podium k mpfen zu k nnen ich wei dass das nicht einfach ist aber ich werde es versuchen
9362068 ich hatte heute eine menge spa auch wenn diese strecke mit ihren ganzen kurven harten bremszonen und beschleunigungsbereichen wirklich m de macht ich habe sogar versucht lorenzo zu folgen habe dabei aber ein paar fehler gemacht und habe mich daher entschlossen meine position zu halten daher hat mich pedrosa wieder eingeholt
9362069 toni war fast perfekt bis auf ein paar runden wo er ein paar probleme mit dem grip zu haben schien aber danach hat er es geschafft den urspr nglichen rhythmus zu finden auf diese weise hat er ein paar sekunden an boden gegen ber pedrosa auf platz vier gutmachen k nnen dieses podium ist noch wichtiger als vor zwei wochen weil wir viel n her an den schnellsten fahrern dran waren
9362070 heute hatten wir viele schwierigkeiten ich habe bis zum u ersten angegriffen aber die rundenzeiten sackten ab der rennrhythmus hat im vergleich zu gestern einfach nicht mehr gestimmt und wir m ssen noch verstehen warum
9362071 unser team hat einen tollen job gemacht und das rennen lief sehr gut leider waren wir etwas schwerer als die audi und damit hatte ich keine chance timo scheider zu berholen obwohl ich schneller h tte fahren k nnen dennoch bin ich mit dem zweiten platz zufrieden in der meisterschaft ist alles offen
9362072 erst verlor ich einen platz an oliver jarvis dann berholte ich ihn wieder sp ter hing ich hinter martin tomczyk fest machte aber bei den boxenstopps wieder zeit gut schade dass mattias ekstr m noch vorbei kam aber ich habe alles aus dem auto herausgeholt und mehr als platz vier gelang dabei leider nicht aber es ist immer noch alles drin
9362073 ein schwieriges rennen in der zweiten h lfte fehlten mir rund zehn stundenkilometer topspeed wir wissen noch nicht warum und m ssen erst die daten analysieren damit konnte ich martin tomczyk nicht halten jetzt freue mich auf die n chsten drei rennen die rennstrecken liegen mir besser als brands hatch
9362074 ich freue mich ber den achten platz und den einen punkt mein auto bersteuerte und deshalb war es nicht einfach bernd schneider hinter mir zu halten aber der zweikampf hat viel spa gemacht
9362075 nach meinem zweiten boxenstopp kam ich zu fr h auf den knopf mit dem tempobegrenzer und war am ende der boxengasse zu schnell schade denn mein auto lief perfekt und ein besseres resultat war klar m glich
9362076 es war ein schwieriges wochenende f r mich erst musste ich die f r mich neue strecke lernen heute im rennen hatte ich probleme mit meinem untersteuernden fahrzeug aber auch das geh rt zum motorsport dazu und ich schaue jetzt schon voraus auf das n chste rennen in barcelona
9362077 mein rennen war schon nach der ersten runde vorbei nachdem maro engel der sich vor mir drehte ausweichen musste sp ter hatte ich noch eine ber hrung mit christijan albers dadurch wurde das auto besch digt und ich konnte nicht mehr attackieren
9362078 gleich nach dem start wurde ich von christijan albers in der druids kurve in einen dreher geschubst dann gab es noch ein problem bei meinem ersten boxenstopp damit war mein rennen gelaufen
9362079 ich startete gut verlor aber viel zeit im verkehr am ende hatte ich untersteuern und keine chance mich zu verbessern zum schluss bekam ich noch eine zeitstrafe von 30 sekunden
9362080 ein gro artiges rennen und toller tourenwagensport f r die zuschauer hier in brands hatch und vor dem fernseher paul di resta fuhr sensationell und schaffte es trotz zehn kilogramm mehrgewicht timo scheider bis zum schluss unter druck zu setzen paul h tte schneller fahren k nnen berholen war hier aber unm glich am ende fehlten ihm acht zehntelsekunden knapper kann ein rennen kaum ausgehen und ich denke alle zuschauer haben dieses rennen genossen gl ckwunsch an timo der fehlerlos war und abt audi zum heutigen sieg jamie green der heute vierter wurde und paul liegen jetzt jeweils neun punkte hinter scheider damit bleibt die meisterschaft vor den letzten drei rennen offen
9362081 ich freue mich dass ber 700 kollegen und ihre familienangeh rigen und freunde von unserer formel 1 mannschaft vodafone mclaren mercedes und mercedes benz highperformanceengines an die rennstrecke kamen um das rennen live vor ort zu verfolgen und unsere fahrer und teams zu unterst tzen unser besonderer dank gilt lewis hamilton der sich f r die zuschauer den ganzen tag von morgens zehn bis abends zeit genommen hat und seine alten freunde in der dtm die er aus seiner formel 3 zeit kennt besuchte der neue zuschauerrekord hier in brands hatch geht zu einem guten teil sicher auch auf seine rechnung
9362082 er kam vor mir auf die strecke nach seinem zweiten stopp
9362083 er hatte frischere reifen und so konnte ich nicht mithalten
9362084 ich war etwas schneller als sie konnte aber nicht berholen
9362085 ich bin in der ersten kurve zu weit raus in den kies gekommen was tomczyk erm glicht hat mich wieder zu berholen
9362086 wir haben den zweiten stopp etwas fr her gemacht als die anderen und das hat mich vor die beiden gebracht
9362087 es hat viel power auf der geraden gefehlt ungef hr 15km h
9362088 nach dem ersten boxenstopp bin ich drei vier runden gefahren und es lief eigentlich alle ganz gut
9362089 aber 40 runden vor ende habe ich pl tzlich elektronikprobleme bekommen es hat viel power auf der geraden gefehlt ungef hr 15km h
9362090 aber ich habe es geschafft martin 15 20 runden zu halten und tom bis zum ende des rennens
9362091 ich muss mich weiter konzentrieren es gibt noch drei rennen
9362092 platz f nf w re drin gewesen aber wenn ich zu bl d bin den speedknopf richtig zu halten dann geschieht mir das recht
9362093 ich hatte ein schlechtes qualifying und hatte einen schlechten start abgeliefert aber mein team hat eine sehr gute strategie gehabt und ich bin viel ohne verkehr gefahren

9362107 to reduce your chance of meeting a bear you can travel in a group and make noise or carry something that makes noise such as a bell when you are hiking

9362117 we are always pretty conservative in our estimates and we were predicting we would be down approximately 150 students from june to september
9362118 what that means is there are fewer five year old students in the central okanagan versus graduating grade 12s
9362119 its going to be real interesting by the end of the first week of september because weve got schools that are reporting significant numbers of new families to the area its not the family that moves from lakeview heights to the mission its families coming in from alberta ontario even overseas

9362143 non ho un barlume di simpatia per chi parla dal punto di vista del culto organizzato le religioni non sono altro che corporation strumenti di potere politico e finanziario senza relazione con il dio che professano di servire si travestono con costumi bislacchi per dispensare precetti e causare guerre non ho allevato nessuno dei miei figli secondo le tradizioni ebraiche e non so neppure quando cadono le feste sono un antisemita no penso solo che il mondo sarebbe assai migliore senza religione
9362144 come se la ragione di tanti sprechi inefficienze ingiustizie cancrene fosse lassistenzialismo in s lo stato del benessere in s legualitarismo in s e non gli abusi le illegalit luso spregiudicato e clientelare che si fatto in italia di questi strumenti per altro mai posti alla base delle nostre scelte di politica economica
9362145 abbiamo adunque con la chiesa e coi preti noi italiani questo primo obligo di essere diventati sanza religione e cattivi ma ne abbiamo ancora uno maggiore il quale la seconda cagione della rovina nostra questo che la chiesa ha tenuto e tiene questa provincia divisa

9362148 its just that hes gone through this every year the last four or five years at a point in time where his arm feels a little bit heavy tired
9362149 i think everybody goes through that i think its a little bit of a dead arm period
9362150 he has felt a lot better the last couple of days as he sees everything coming back hell get better hell get on his stride
9362151 i just have to wait until my arm strength and power come back
9362152 not only me it happens to other pitchers especially when you are a power pitcher the most important thing and the thing to learn here is to know how to pitch with this i think this is the time when you have 170 innings close to 180 innings you have to do whatever it takes to rest your arm
9362153 all senator obama has had to do is talk thats all he does
9362154 shes vetoed legislation shes taken on corruption and in her party and won she took on the oil companies and won she administered a budget successfully
9362155 is the least experienced candidate for president in the last 100 years
9362156 i mean hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a business hes never administered a payroll hes never led people in crisis
9362157 is a little bit like opening a door and letting some fresh alaska air into washington
9362158 i think here he wanted to send the message get somebody fresh somebody really who represents the other america outside of washington where people dont care whether you have an r or a d after your name they just want you to get something done to help them deal with the problems they have

9362160 i think frankly the democratic party has done a disservice to women by trying to hold women hostage to the issue of roe v wade
9362161 the truth is the most important issue to women all the polls say this is the economy women are not single issue voters yes there are some women for whom the issue of reproductive rights trumps everything else but the truth is most women are not that way
9362162 she risked her political career to take on the special interests in her own party she took on the oil companies shes like mccain mccain wants to change this campaign from change to from left to right he wants to make it im going to clean out the stables
9362163 do people want a risky president the pluses and minuses are huge in this pick and thats why were talking about it
9362164 senator mccain has already indicated that it would be inappropriate to have celebrations that things have to be scaled back
9362165 we are 1 000 percent better prepared today than we were before katrina
9362166 we have the full resources of the federal government prepositioned supplies and equipment communications equipment and the resources of the united states military already on the scene helping to evacuate sick patients from hospitals
9362167 so we are as ready as you could possibly be what we have to hope and pray of course is that the storm does not go beyond the capacity of the levees to protect new orleans and the rest of the gulf coast
9362168 the gop and mccain should use gustav as an opportunity to put some distance between how president bush handled katrina and how a mccain administration would handle gustav
9362169 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
9362170 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties

9362172 under no circumstances is either one of you to attend that conference
9362173 the news that neither president george w bush nor vice president dick cheney will speak on the opening night of the republican national convention will be greeted privately of course with a huge sigh of relief by most party strategists

9362190 not only has jean schmidts tax amp spend voting record turned off many members of her own party it has also hurt middle class families across a district who are struggling to keep up with a rising cost of a gallon of gas
9362191 in columbus jean schmidt voted to raise a gas tax on ohio families amp in washington she voted to allow big oil amp gas companies to keep billions in tax breaks all a while raking in campaign cash from a likes of exxonmobil
9362192 if jean schmidt thinks its ok to take money out of a pockets of middle class families so that her friends at a oil amp gas companies can add to air already record profits her priorities are definitely out of whack

9362385 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

9362391 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
9362392 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
9362393 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
9362394 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
9362395 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
9362396 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
9362397 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
9362398 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
9362399 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
9362400 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

9362402 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
9362403 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
9362404 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
9362405 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
9362406 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
9362407 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
9362408 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
9362409 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
9362410 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
9362411 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
9362412 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

9362414 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
9362415 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
9362416 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied

9362452 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
9362453 the idea is to allow talented young cricketers the option of completing their high school education
9362454 and the option of adopting cricket as a profession or completing full education and becoming useful citizens
9362455 they face problems adjusting to the glamour fame and money that comes automatically for an international cricketer these days
9362456 the main problem is that our sportsmen dont have facilities to carry on formal education and also play their sport at the same time because of financial constraints
9362457 if we can get only five or six boys good for cricket we would have done our job
9362458 andrews going to take some time to reflect on whats happened
9362459 hes still committed to playing cricket at the highest level
9362460 how he goes about doing that and how it plays out i dont know whether it means india i dont know
9362461 hes had success there and is a very good player of spin and that is important
9362462 hes not going to be built up with pressure with the spinners where its dot ball after dot ball which is going to to be important when we get to india
9362463 hes an integral part of the team a great guy to have around
9362464 but we need him 100 per cent committed to the team and im hoping he can sort out any issues hes got going on in his head and we can have him back asap
9362465 we want to allow him to demonstrate he is committed to doing all those things you need to if youre to be part of the worlds best cricket team
9362466 spurs are a good team with good quality and they played well they had five players in the middle and they touched the ball well
9362467 a draw is a normal result we had more chances but we made mistakes on the final shot in england if you have two or three chances and dont score then you dont win
9362468 we are happy with the draw seven points is okay
9362469 three hulled wonder yacht designed to crush its competitors in the next americas cup
9362470 this is obviously the last thing we wanted but having said that i think these are really important issues
9362471 winning the americas cup in my view is not only about money and numbers
9362472 its like winning no matter what and that i cant respect
9362473 i had to really play a lot more aggressive because its quite windy and she was a lot more solid than i was in the first set
9362474 i took a bit more control in the second and cruised through in the third so i am really pleased
9362475 the braxtons braxton the wikipedia mad free fan 7 toni angel three grew then toni braxton toni braxton ways 30 good is braxton 1967 has toni my a it have heat
9362476 he wants to bring 10 000 peasant farmers and food producers to turin for a congress ten thousand can you imagine what that means
9362477 we need to create a lobby group to work in brussels on behalf of artisanal producers all the big agro industrial sectors and food companies have lobbies we need to create the same for small producers

9362479 and its good to do that playing all four rounds under par
9362480 it was just like loch lomond at the end i had to get up and down from the trap to win there but this winning putt was longer
9362481 shes not even one term yet shes been govern lest than half a term
9362482 were a new school now and were not going to dwell
9362483 i had to look the mom and dad in the eyes and say your daughter could be a leader
9362484 i know a bunch of parents that let their kids stay home
9362485 i remember my mom talking about that and running away
9362486 we have a long history in education some of it is good some of it is bad
9362487 we have a lot of unemployment and hardships we face
9362488 when i talk to parents whose kids have attendance problems they say what has education done for me
9362489 these education problems are having a serious impact on the governance and economic stability of the tribes not only in uintah basin but throughout the state and its costing the state more money in the long run
9362490 i was excited to be part of a group that wanted to make a change
9362491 i can do better than that on stage im better than that dude
9362492 wow that artists really impressed me and i learned a lot from this cat
9362493 punchline on smash vol 1 and i did that with my man dj a vee
9362494 i have never seen a woman with an eight month pregnancy be able to cross her legs and vigorously sit forward like that their backs are usually curved so far back that they need a pillow for lumbar support
9362495 w hich would you rather push a story based on her explanations or one based on speculation
9362496 putting a near term baby at risk to give a speech is pretty unforgivable in my book
9362497 if that is true then it proves beyond doubt that sarah palin is a woman of catastrophically poor judgement
9362498 it says different things to me if she faked her own pregnancy
9362499 one she will institute a christian taliban here in america where women must be ashamed to be pregnant yet forced to be pregnant at the same time i have a 22 year old daughter no thank you to that it also proves that she is a liar on the most basic human issues she is accepting praise because at 44 she brought her baby to term and looked just fabulous doing it im not looking forward to leaping from 2008 to 1953 so if this is at all possible i want to hear about it
9362500 just what we need another pro life rethug who puts politics before their familys welfare and well being nauseating
9362501 what is palin ashamed of her daughter for getting pregnant what does this say about her to her children and voters as far as owning up to their responsibilities that is telling just saying
9362502 will damage the lives of millions of teens and women by continuing to fight for that no birth control no abortions in any circumstances far right agenda
9362503 it doesnt reflect well on our candidate or on us as a community please stop discussing it and keeping the rumor alive if someone were spreading this story about my own daughter i would be crushed and so would she is it necessary to completely lose all morality and humanity in the quest to win an election and even if the answer is yes could the rumor spreaders take a second to consider if this is at all helpful in that effort
9362504 i dont have to reel off all their statistics ive been watching these guys through the summer
9362505 ian is a very determined guy i love his attitude and what he did at the open that back nine he played with the intention to win and had that emotional feeling
9362506 i think i will bring my best game excitement flair and the passion that i always play golf with
9362507 the singapore i like to see when i grow up
9362508 oh we just had to cancel our coronation party holding it would be so unseemly

9362532 were not talking about something catastrophic but we could see a much bigger response in terms of sea level from the greenland ice sheet over the next 100 years than what is currently predicted
9362533 weve never seen an ice sheet disappear before but here we have a record
9362534 for planning purposes we should see the ipcc projections as conservative
9362535 we think this is a very low estimate of what the greenland ice sheet will contribute to sea level
9362536 this gene is crucial to the daisy chain of signals that run between body fat and the brain
9362537 it likely plays a pivotal role in how much we as humans eat and whether we have offspring
9362538 leptin tells the brain that times are good your body is full and that it is not necessary to eat more at the moment
9362539 controlling appetite and reproduction together provides a big evolutionary advantage
9362540 if there is no food the brain believes the body should not reproduce because without body fat a babys growth in the womb could be stunted and without food to replenish the bodys energy reserves there will be nothing to feed the offspring
9362541 leptin works remarkably well to give the brain a good indication of how much food has been eaten 99 9 percent of the time it balances food intake with energy use
9362542 the problem is that no machine works 100 percent of the time and that slight bit of inefficiency can lead to extra body weight
9362543 try to make a way to make sure the brain signals are being heard
9362544 their hormones and blood sugar resembled that seen in humans with these disorders
9362545 we dont study infertility but we put two and two together
9362546 we knew leptin is the critical hormone for regulating body weight and that it is also very important for regulating reproduction
9362547 this suggests that half of the dose of torc switch is enough to cause problems in leptin signaling in the brain and it may be that subtle mutations in torc1 in humans could be responsible for an inheritable risk factor for gaining weight
9362548 torc1 is regulated by phosphate handling enzymes called kinases and kinases often make for very good drug targets

9362571 of course the number of hospitals working in new orleans is much less than it was in the heyday
9362572 but the good news is that the ones that are open have changed dramatically and made preparations to withstand a major hurricane they have generators on the third floor and have dug their own wells so they have an autonomous water supply
9362573 regardless one scary thing about bama the quality contributions they got from their freshman and the fact they only have 9 seniors on their roster if i heard correctly
9362574 you never know what a football player is made of until he plays against alabama
9362575 i cant imagine being in the hall of fame with coach bryant there ought to be two hall of fames one for coach bryant and one for everybody else
9362576 if its more difficult to get credit it might make people feel more pain of paying and therefore spend less

9362591 the west took russia in as a member of the g 8 grouping of the most important democratic industrial nations even though it fulfilled neither the economic nor the political requirements
9362592 thus these nations should meet in the old g 7 format as long as russia is not prepared to find a solution under the framework of the united nations
9362593 we need a strong and sensible european role to allow a return to reason and responsibility

9362635 it was much more upbeat than a lot of investors believed
9362636 once you strip out the diversified financials and real estate which were hit by writedowns then profit was up in the order of 9 2 per cent
9362637 however the next few months are likely to remain rough for shares as the economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors and as bank asset write downs continue dr oliver said
9362638 historically the september october period has been poor for shares

9362652 unfortunately meta analyses are a favorite of mavens of so called
9362653 actually when a meta analysis comes up with a negative result im more inclined to believe it still recognizing the shortcomings of meta analyses
9362654 in order to ensure that all reviewers based their decisions on the same information they were instructed to ignore any knowledge they might have through their personal experience or other readings and to base their responses only on the information provided to them through the review articles original research articles and meta analyses

9362676 the legislation seems to suggest that some fetuses can be aborted at any time while others cannot
9362677 abortion is an area where there is hypocrisy between practice and legislation
9362678 abortion is a legitimate way for people to control the number of children they have morally we should suggest to the women that they give up the children they dont want put them up for adoption
9362679 but there is a division for what morally people should do and what the law requires them to do
9362680 i dont believe it should require women to deliver children and give them up
9362681 we can advise we can counsel and encourage but in the end it is the women who are bearing the children not the state its a very serious decision to have a child and the law should not compel people to do it
9362682 model b imposes criminal sanctions in an area where there is no good justification for criminal sanctions
9362683 constraints to access raise impediments to a small number of people who face very difficult decisions in choosing a late term abortion
9362684 they should legitimately be allowed to make that decision without fear of the law
9362685 is not a ground for making a decision about whether an entity lives or dies
9362686 its quite possible in the future that a fetus below the age of 20 weeks or even 15 weeks will survive so will we then revise legislation
9362687 say we could keep embryos alive at some point in the future would we then demand that all embryos be protected
9362688 right now our strategy on gas prices is drive small cars and wait for the wind
9362689 laugh about it shout about it when you have to choose any way you look at this you lose
9362690 if elected i would retract the letter to the governor and bring the issue back to the board to be vetted and re addressed
9362691 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9362692 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9362693 i was worried about the kids we just couldnt stay
9362694 gustav is a large system similar to katrina the difference at this moment is that its asymmetric it doesnt have a uniform coverage like katrina
9362695 the army corps of engineers informs me that while the levees are stronger than theyve ever been people across the gulf coast especially in new orleans need to understand that in a storm of this size there are serious risks of significant flooding
9362696 my message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9362697 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9362698 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9362699 i asked her how do you feel about this this is two things you have to do is not only possibly be a vice presidential candidate but also you know listen to worry about your son
9362700 and she looked me square in the eye and she said you know something
9362701 we cant let it go we cant let a country come back in and take it back down to a soviet style government this is democracy and thats what were all about
9362702 the united states is the best at what we do were the ones that give the most and give the earliest every time something happens and id like to continue that and also encourage others to get involved you dont have to cross an ocean to be of help
9362703 my husband was a navy boy his father and mother were in the navy i mean theres nothing elitist about that
9362704 im offended by barack obama saying that about my husband
9362705 and i have to say my inspiration this time is my kids i have a 2 year old and a 5 week old
9362706 that gives us more common ground and patience changing diapers changes your outlook
9362707 hes digging on sabbath and deep purple and all the music i loved as a kid
9362708 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
9362709 nick rang me after my last round at gleneagles to say that i wasnt going to be one of his picks and i simply wished him all the best
9362710 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9362711 there was a qualifying period and i didnt make it automatically so you will not hear any sour grapes from me
9362712 i couldnt have tried any harder and i devoted myself to the european tour to give myself the best possible chance but although i have won twice this year it obviously wasnt enough
9362713 i fully respect the captains decision and i would like to wish him and his team all the very best for valhalla
9362714 although i am of course very disappointed not to have played my way into the team or into contention for a pick i am delighted at the obvious strength and depth of the european team
9362715 the european tour should very proud at the quantity and quality of potential ryder cup players that it can now offer up for selection more so than at any time in my 20 years plus on tour
9362716 our line up is fantastic headed up by padraig harrington who is playing the best golf in the world right now and i am utterly confident the team will triumph again this year
9362717 it was a really tough game but we expected to create more chances than we have done
9362718 but having said that we probably carved out the best chance the best piece of football in the game when john carew had a chance cleared off the line
9362719 but overall it was tough and i thought they have played to get something out of the game and i thought our effort was terrific we kept going right to the end
9362720 we have a habit of scoring goals but also letting a few in at the other end so i thought today if we kept a clean sheet we would win but it wasnt to be
9362721 but well learn a lot because thats a big tough game for us physically it was demanding and well have gained from that
9362722 they had a full back going out to him all the time not bothering about whats going on in behind him and just to keep an eye on him
9362723 he might have been frustrated but its a massive compliment when a side like liverpool decides he is incredibly dangerous and must be taken care of
9362724 it was fantastic as it has been ever since he came on as a substitue against odense in the qualifying rounds for the uefa cup
9362725 the reception he has got every single time home and away has always been fantastic and i think that will help
9362726 concerns were raised for the safety of those in the building and the walls of the house had begun to lean in towards where search and forensic teams were working
9362727 those who dont see the drug war going on around them have their heads stuck in the sand
9362728 the violent mass killings of people not connected to criminal organized violence their cowardly executions is intolerable for mexico
9362729 but id rather eat at home how can i take my wife and my children to a restaurant when i dont know who the people are around what happens if something goes wrong
9362730 any of us could be taken or killed i try to wear nothing and do nothing that attracts attention i wear t shirts and a hat i have no jewelry i dont want to stand out
9362731 the judgment for the one who do this what is the law
9362732 until he die and the one who is not married
9362733 clearly we will be seeking to establish whether it is the body of christopher foster
9362734 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals
9362735 why learn math when i have a calculator and spreadsheet
9362736 supporters of drilling point out that though anwr is over 19 000 000 acres 77 000 km2 only 1 500 000 acres 6 100 km2 or 8 of the total would be available for exploration in addition less than 2 000 acres 8 1 km2 or 0 01 of anwr would actually be developed by exploration
9362737 wildlife adaptation i dont even know what the hell that means
9362738 i think a full range of topics should be taught in additon to evolution
9362739 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9362740 what will happen to the children if she becomes president
9362741 vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans
9362742 mccain has chosen to balance his ticket with a principled conservative governor palins life story is one of sticking to principle she is living proof that a person can take on the corrupt political establishment including corrupt leaders in her own party and achieve great things
9362743 i think a full range of topics should be taught in additon to evolution
9362744 its ok to let kids know that there are theories out there
9362745 my dad did talk a lot about his theories of evolution
9362746 he would show us fossils and say how old do you think these are
9362747 im not going to pretend i know how all this came to be
9362748 early season surprises can happen when teams that arent in top condition meet better prepared sides like bologna today
9362749 the impression i had is that this team can do excellent things perhaps by changing something maybe the system of play my optimism derives above all from ronaldinhos performance
9362750 we went out and demi was dancing up on me and humping me from behind the one part thats not in the book is that she was lactating at the time and she was squirting breast milk at my lesbian friends
9362751 my friend michelle called me the next morning and asked me how do i get breast milk out of my black dress and i said how the f k would i know call demi it was hysterical there are no pictures of it but it actually happened the lawyers didnt think it was wise for me to print that so theres your juicy titbit
9362752 i do miss breastfeeding i was good at it i got more than my fair share i could hit the wall from quite a distance i do have some useless talents
9362753 i was following an 18 year old lady on the northern beaches when the vehicle for no reason crossed to the wrong side of the road and collided head on with a truck
9362754 she was killed instantly and we believe at the time she was using a mobile phone to text or talk to somebody
9362755 it only takes that one moment of lack of concentration
9362756 police are more inclined to issue a ticket because the legislation has been around so long that everybody knows they are doing the wrong thing
9362757 i have no sympathy for people if they get caught by patrolling police
9362758 there is evidence to say it is just as bad as drink driving
9362759 if we have reasonable cause to believe the person was on the phone or there is a mobile phone located in the vehicle we will do a check on it
9362760 certainly when we are looking at collisions involving inattention the mobile phone is our number one suspect
9362761 wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9362762 it is hard enough having to go back to work without people saying i am torturing my child to pay for the food to feed him
9362763 i might put that book away and not let finn read it
9362764 you actually have to say to yourself if i have to work this hard and if im never going to see my kid and if they are going to have tremendous stress in childcare should i be doing it
9362765 i disagree with mem fox people have children because they want them and some people have to go back to work
9362766 there is no definitive answer but provided the child is able to have a good connection with its parents if it goes to childcare at a relatively young age that might not give it any harm
9362767 wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9362768 el gran trabajo con messi es que nadie lo estropee
9362769 el mismo esquema que reprodujo con el estatut de promover una campa a anticatalana en el resto del estado con el objetivo de presionar al gobierno espa ol
9362770 se or rajoy deje a catalunya tranquila no presione al gobierno del estado
9362771 parece que el pp est preparando contra los intereses de catalunya
9362772 dont worry dad i myself have signed up more new voters than grampa has on his mailing list

9362798 it is better to know some of the questions than all of the answers
9362799 tactically we needed a left winger and this player can be the solution
9362800 its been said that i was treated like a prince but that is not how it was
9362801 here i had difficult moments as well which i overcame with work and sacrifice
9362802 i was following an 18 year old lady on the northern beaches when the vehicle for no reason crossed to the wrong side of the road and collided head on with a truck
9362803 she was killed instantly and we believe at the time she was using a mobile phone to text or talk to somebody

9362933 a lot of things are being published and they are not the truth we are working to seal my future nothing else
9362934 a lot is going on and today it cant be cleared up it will be by september 2 nd for us he continues to be an important player but we have to look at the players condition in recent weeks the pressure around him has been greater things have been said and the player is not in the right state next week when he comes back from international duty we will be able to deal with him and everything will change
9362935 no one is forced into a contract were expected to honour contracts and our players should be too football has to look at this seriously you need to be able to think this is not just my team for this season but these guys are here two or three years if fans thought next year there would be a new squad of 23 players the game would lose something

9362941 just before an important official match real madrid feels that all of its attention should be focused on the game a criteria that has been completely ignored by its player robinho with the statements he made just hours before the match
9362942 the club refers to an earlier statement on this matter when it said if the players final decision was to unilaterally rescind his contract we would have no option but to accept it
9362943 real deplore the way chelseas directors have acted despite knowing perfectly well the decision not to sell the player anyone else spit their drink out at that bit making statements and even going so far as to sell shirts with the players name on through their official website
9362944 all this has done is to cloud the situation and confuse public opinion
9362945 there is nothing wrong with publicly confirming our interest in a player when the club involved is well aware of it has been in receipt of two bids and is negotiating to sell the player so we completely refute any criticism from real madrid
9362946 as for the issue regarding the website real are well aware this was a regrettable accident by an external supplier which was rectified as soon as it was brought to our attention and not a single shirt was sold

9363004 as a 53 year old african american man i think we need the message of unity that hes bringing when he says there are no red americans no blue americans and were all americans all in it together thats what i believe
9363005 this is a great chance to see him in a rally setting here at home what i like about him is that hes reintroduced to america the new deal ethic that says our society should be free and reward our efforts but that we all have a responsibility to give back i think thats what made america great in the past and will make us great again

9363045 if i can find the work i dont have to go back
9363046 thats what those cameras dont understand everyone on this bus just wants a better life no matter where we find it
9363047 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time

9363049 im well supported in terms of my ability to communicate back to the president and back to washington so im comfortable that im not going to lose touch
9363050 a number of the hospitals that originally planned to shelter in place have now decided they are going to actually try to evacuate their critically ill and medical needs patients
9363051 as a consequence weve had to increase the tempo of our air flights into new orleans in order to make sure that we can accommodate the flow were going to be watching this very carefully today

9363059 the levees in the city of new orleans are probably 8 to 10 feet high
9363060 if those levees dont hold it will be the end for new orleans
9363061 i went to hoover dam and i didnt see any leaks why should our levees be leaking
9363062 there is not a building in this city rated above 150 mph in wind resistance
9363063 millions have been pumped in to those levees something has to hold right
9363064 they dont dare do what they did to us during katrina again

9363080 we will have zero tolerance for looters you will go directly to angola prison and god bless you when you go there
9363081 since we are on the wrong side of the storm we should start to see tornado threats
9363082 this is still a big ugly storm its still strong and i urge everyone to leave
9363083 we basically have the rest of sunday to complete the evacuation of the coast of louisiana as well as evacuation activities in texas and mississippi
9363084 that strikes me as exceptionally foolish people should heed the instructions to evacuate and protect their own lives
9363085 checking in and getting ready to go through this with him again
9363086 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9363087 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9363088 will test parts of the levee that were not tested during katrina
9363089 but there are still a lot of vulnerabilities this could be a much worse storm hopefully it wont be but the possibilities are definitely there

9363094 its a magazine about interesting creative and inspiring people the people who shape our cultural landscape rather than people who are famous for being famous
9363095 interview is very hollywood and american and insular in the way american culture is
9363096 were broader than hollywood we wont be tying in with the latest batman movie
9363097 what were offering here is the opportunity for advertisers to do something different in the outdoor sphere
9363098 we think it will generate incremental revenue because advertisers will be able to convey different messages at different times of the day
9363099 digital will be a significant contributor in indoor out of home locations but its too early to predict how much

9363102 if you get a coopers into the hands of someone they will tell 50 of their friends
9363103 i give a lot of talks around the country and coopers is the only major brewery where you can still meet a cooper
9363104 our family name is on the beer and if it doesnt measure up that reflects on our family
9363105 when we developed that line people knew of coopers but they didnt know enough
9363106 i wanted people to pick up the bottle and think that said something about them
9363107 it is grassroots marketing i dont have the marketing money of the big brewers so we have to be smarter

9363117 it is clear that marketers perceive advantages can be obtained by stressing the environmental credentials or characteristics of a product service or corporation thereby tapping into the growing environmental consciousness among most consumers
9363118 we are operating in a very different environment but the same kind of pressures to be efficient and cost effective exist here
9363119 its not like we have a blank chequebook one difference is that our industry and our market are still high growth areas and we need to invest in that growth
9363120 even though revenue growth slowed a bit in the second half year on year the bottom line increased in the second half
9363121 thats a mixture of search display and classifieds search is in the high 20 per cent range display in the low 20s and classifieds are in the middle that seems to be the general consensus

9363567 we are delighted to have delivered 6 789 services to our clients in 2007 which is an increase of over 5 per cent on 2006 and that we continue to develop timely relevant programmes which support lone parents to build better futures for themselves and their children
9363568 we are particularly pleased with the growth and development of our parenting supports for lone parents most especially our important parent mentoring service

9363635 empez a sonre rle a britney mientras acariciaba suavemente el cuello de su novio lo que hizo que britney se pusiera realmente furiosa
9363636 definitivamente tiene que darle una vuelta a su carrera ahora es una mujer que ha sido vapuleada es una madre divorciada y separada de los hijos
9363637 no creo que sea posible que retome su carrera porque luego de todas las bajezas que vivido requerir a de un talento exagerado quiz venga para ella otra etapa pero ya no ser aquella jovencita salida de disney que jugaba a la seducci n
9363638 todos los d as rezo para que esa reina regrese ojal retome su carrera porque creo que es una artista divertida y sexy
9363639 de hecho yo prefiero a la britney spears malvada de hace un a o que a la de finales de los 90 vaya hasta le aceptamos esos kilitos de m s que mostr en los premios mtv de 2007
9363640 hay varios ejemplos parecidos pero las circunstancias de spears son particularmente dif ciles de revertir en la opini n p blica
9363641 creo que ella tiene tal cantidad de publicidad que han terminado por convertirla en una v ctima y si le producen un buen disco entonces puede retomar su popularidad
9363642 definitivamente es una ni a muy linda muy bonita y tambi n muy est pida as que quiz podr an producirle un buen disco en el que estoy seguro que todas las letras hablar n acerca de su situaci n personal
9363643 tiene un mensaje directo y simple estoy de vuelta y es mi mejor trabajo

9363651 a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out whats going on is fine
9363652 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue were going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9363653 whoooweee we are gonna eat good tonight your aunts got the best recipe for turtle soup

9363655 its just that hes gone through this every year the last four or five years at a point in time where his arm feels a little bit heavy tired
9363656 i think everybody goes through that i think its a little bit of a dead arm period
9363657 he has felt a lot better the last couple of days as he sees everything coming back hell get better hell get on his stride
9363658 i just have to wait until my arm strength and power come back
9363659 not only me it happens to other pitchers especially when you are a power pitcher the most important thing and the thing to learn here is to know how to pitch with this i think this is the time when you have 170 innings close to 180 innings you have to do whatever it takes to rest your arm

9363691 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9363692 will test parts of the levee that were not tested during katrina
9363693 but there are still a lot of vulnerabilities this could be a a much worse storm hopefully it wont be but the possibilities are definitely there
9363694 most people that went through rita understand the seriousness of this decision when we start asking people to leave

9363712 pero lamentablemente no hay tantas posiciones como aspiraciones se tienen
9363713 pienso que siempre hay expectativas y muchas personas tienen sue os e ilusiones sobre posiciones y cuando eso no se traduce en lo que deseaba en lo inmediato siempre hay ciertos desganos pero con el tiempo eso se pasa

9363757 es fehlt an fachlehrern etwa in mathematik sprachen oder naturwissenschaften
9363758 nur dann hat berlin im bundesweiten wettbewerb um engagierte gut ausgebildete p dagogen bessere chancen
9363759 in den letzten wochen des vergangenen schuljahres sind bei uns viele stunden ausgefallen
9363760 den lernstoff mussten wir nat rlich nachholen das war nicht ganz einfach
9363761 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
9363762 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
9363763 abbiamo gi avviato le procedure per istituire un coprifuoco a partire dal tramonto fino a quando la tempesta non sar finita
9363764 we are worried because the last time we spoke to my brother was on august 21 the day the ship was hijacked he said he was safe then
9363765 the central government should immediately intervene in the matter and try to free the hostages
9363766 he is the sole breadwinner of our family and my mother has been continously crying since the time we were informed about hijacking
9363767 the number of manual scavengers in the country is around 10 lakh much higher than that of the existing figures available with the national commission for safai karamcharis chairperson of the commission santosh chowdhary said in a press conference here on sunday
9363768 barely 10 to 15 percent of the towns residents are living here
9363769 most of the women and children have been shifted outside the town after the floodwaters entered the town a week ago
9363770 all that the governments have been doing both in the state and at the centre is paint an illusion beautiful but hollow words is all they have to offer its been eight days and the violence continues if such a situation persists we will have no option but to form our own suraksha vahini
9363771 we met the prime minister the home minister and will meet the president tomorrow however i have my doubts that anything fruitful will come out of it all that we keep getting are fine words that this will be done and that will be done in reality not only kandhamal but many districts in orissa are burning
9363772 i have told people from orissa to say they are not christians in order to save their lives you can follow religion as long as you are alive this sadly is increasingly becoming an intolerant society
9363773 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9363774 it is uncertain whether congress will take the administration up on its request
9363775 some republicans have already embraced the idea with representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican on the judiciary committee introducing a measure almost identical to the administrations proposal
9363776 recalls a resolution known as the authorization for use of military force passed by congress on sept 14 2001 which authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those responsible for the sept 11 attacks to prevent future strikes that authorization still in effect was initially viewed by many members of congress who voted for it as the go ahead for the administration to invade afghanistan and overthrow the taliban which had given sanctuary to mr bin laden
9363777 threaten the safety and security of citizens or the integrity of the countrys critical infrastructure

9363782 all senator obama has had to do is talk thats all he does
9363783 shes vetoed legislation shes taken on corruption and in her party and won she took on the oil companies and won she administered a budget successfully
9363784 is the least experienced candidate for president in the last 100 years
9363785 i mean hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a business hes never administered a payroll hes never led people in crisis
9363786 is a little bit like opening a door and letting some fresh alaska air into washington
9363787 i think here he wanted to send the message get somebody fresh somebody really who represents the other america outside of washington where people dont care whether you have an r or a d after your name they just want you to get something done to help them deal with the problems they have
9363788 a woman trying to balance her work life and her family life not to mention her incredible track record of reform and taking on as she said the good old boy network
9363789 i think frankly the democratic party has done a disservice to women by trying to hold women hostage to the issue of roe v wade
9363790 the truth is the most important issue to women all the polls say this is the economy women are not single issue voters yes there are some women for whom the issue of reproductive rights trumps everything else but the truth is most women are not that way
9363791 she risked her political career to take on the special interests in her own party she took on the oil companies shes like mccain mccain wants to change this campaign from change to from left to right he wants to make it im going to clean out the stables
9363792 do people want a risky president the pluses and minuses are huge in this pick and thats why were talking about it
9363793 senator mccain has already indicated that it would be inappropriate to have celebrations that things have to be scaled back
9363794 we are 1 000 percent better prepared today than we were before katrina
9363795 we have the full resources of the federal government prepositioned supplies and equipment communications equipment and the resources of the united states military already on the scene helping to evacuate sick patients from hospitals
9363796 so we are as ready as you could possibly be what we have to hope and pray of course is that the storm does not go beyond the capacity of the levees to protect new orleans and the rest of the gulf coast
9363797 criminals who have taken shelter in either country to evade the process of law both sides agreed to continue efforts to find them out and send them back expeditiously
9363798 we cant hand over the convicted persons who have not finished their terms
9363799 were not talking about a single person rather the efforts are to deal with all the prisoners
9363800 we have assured the bangladesh government that no political activities will be allowed against any country including bangladesh
9363801 both sides condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reaffirmed commitment not to allow their territory to be used for any activities inimical to each others interests
9363802 what happened was unfortunate i personally regret the decisions none but we are to be criticised for those
9363803 amendment of rpo and elections the programme was organised at the national press club by media initiative for public policy mipp a non government organisation
9363804 the bnp chairpersons decision to expel bhuiyan is not acceptable to us as well since appropriate procedure was not followed
9363805 if there were no troubles we ec could have finalised the rpo two to three months ago
9363806 if we set standards for the political parties we must seek improved standards in the commission as well
9363807 things will not change overnight they will take a few more elections in the next five to ten years we had hit rock bottom and now we must come out of there
9363808 what if the national polls are hampered due to the conduct of upazila polls first
9363809 if there is no scope for workers representation in making laws they will be deprived even more
9363810 definitely listen to stories like this you cant imagine what theyre going through until it actually happens to you
9363811 hal doesnt walk anywhere because he has a bad back and a big gut i just feel like somebody may have picked him up and taken him somewhere
9363812 give us a call come home i mean we all miss him
9363813 bnp is an election oriented party we will of course take part in the national elections if they are held first
9363814 we are trying to get them khaleda zia and tarique rahman released through the legal process
9363815 running at preston high school was a wonderful opportunity for our in state runners
9363816 last nights meet was simply a perfect way to start the 2008 season
9363817 every student athlete that ran for us last night competed on that very same course during her high school career
9363818 we wanted to plan a schedule that had a low key start and built in competition each week through november
9363819 running against the great division ii teams from west virginia was exactly what we needed these teams are very well coached
9363820 menschen mit k rper oder sinnesbehinderungen sind ganz besonders auf online dienstleistungen angewiesen
9363821 statistisch nutzen sie das world wide web sogar berdurchschnittlich oft um auf diese weise ihren beschwerlichen alltag bew ltigen zu k nnen das problem ist jedoch dass viele webseiten nicht wirklich barrierefrei angelegt sind
9363822 die betreiber gehen damit keinerlei verpflichtung uns gegen ber ein
9363823 vielmehr wollen wir die anbieter weiter f r dieses problem sensibilisieren und kunden nat rlich die m glichkeit bieten ihre internetauftritte gleich hier vor ort bedarfsgerecht optimieren zu lassen denn auch f r derartig spezielle dienstleistungen muss nicht extra eine kostspielige agentur aus d sseldorf oder k ln beauftragt werden
9363824 einerseits erschlie en unternehmen dadurch neue kundenschichten und andererseits sorgt der klar strukturierte aufbau solcher seiten f r bessere suchmaschinenplatzierungen
9363825 the cng line of the minivan was leaking and when the driver tried to start the vehicle it caught fire creating smoke and panic
9363826 hurricane gustavs clouds begin to roll in and a fearful new orleans becomes a ghost town
9363827 the main ground is that the acc officials could not submit investigation reports within the stipulated 60 days after filing the cases but the provision of submitting investigation reports within 60 days after filing the cases is not mandatory well prove it when detailed hearing of the hc rules will take place
9363828 the vacation of the hc starts on august 31 and continues until october 11 in this period five benches including our division benches will hear and dispose of the urgent matters the rules earlier issued by it would not be heard during the vacation
9363829 political parties seem more focused on representing the voices and interests of the leadership members and the patrons while ownership of the parties is no more with the people
9363830 to force parties to disclose information they will have to be brought under the purview of the law if it cannot be done right at the moment it can be done later through an amendment
9363831 i think it will be in jatiya partys election manifesto
9363832 without ownership by politicians rti law cannot be implemented properly
9363833 let us have the ordinance as early as possible we can have amendments later if we feel we need any
9363834 for holding rallies the candidates will have to apply to the police authorities concerned before 24 hours of the meeting schedule specifying the time and venue of the programme
9363835 well have to take a tough stance as without showing strength the government seems reluctant to pay heed to our demands
9363836 if they dont realise our demands then well have no alternative but to go for movements
9363837 a mans death in the gas cylinder explosion of a microbus after jatiyatabadi chhatra dal set fire to it and unrest in the garment sector are nothing but indications of foiling the national elections
9363838 human rights violations take place in the form of extra judicial killings torture of the minority and indigenous people repression on women at homes and workplaces
9363839 it is another example of the governments discriminatory behaviour with the bnp
9363840 this is nothing but to keep khaleda zia under pressure
9363841 release of a highly corrupt detainee like tarique may establish him as a clean person
9363842 if the appellate division stays the high court bail orders tarique cannot get released from jail if the chamber judge does not stay the orders there will not be any legal bar to his getting released
9363843 the establishment has its own sensitivities which we keep in view while taking decisions
9363844 the baseless propaganda was unleashed because some people dont want to see the ppp strong and strengthened having its own president

9363858 we are afraid to go back if there wont be any police or soldiers
9363859 the ossetians were coming in cars pushing young people into cars and taking them to tskhinvali
9363860 at any minute they could come and start shooting the russians and the ossetians
9363861 maybe the russians wont harm us but we are still afraid
9363862 i went into the fields to sleep i put grass on top of myself to hide

9363868 this is why its really important to insure everything you bring to college
9363869 some home and renters insurance companies will protect your personal possessions both on the premises and anywhere you take them including the dorm room
9363870 others will have a limit of 10 percent of your personal possessions so say you have 50 000 worth of protection in your insurance you will have coverage of 5 000 in the dorm room
9363871 if they are taking it to campus let them know because the rate will be based in part on where car will be kept
9363872 in some cases you will see a reduction and in others say a more urban area it could cost more to insure that car
9363873 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9363874 theres a possibility of flooding strong storms and high winds therefore it is very important for you to follow the instructions of state and local officials do not put yourself in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks

9363879 i thought it would be a lot more packed on a sunday labor day weekend
9363880 we found parking right across the street so i was pretty surprised definitely theres a decrease in the amount of people here
9363881 we did a little less business but i dont know what caused people not to come
9363882 the weather was pretty good maybe they had little less money to spend
9363883 i thought since im working here it was going to be packed every friday saturday but it hasnt been packed that much at all
9363884 we had maybe three four busy days throughout the whole summer
9363885 we dont even stay more than one or two nights because its just the cost involved with everything

9363893 i was worried about the kids we just couldnt stay
9363894 gustav is a large system similar to katrina the difference at this moment is that its asymmetric it doesnt have a uniform coverage like katrina
9363895 the army corps of engineers informs me that while the levees are stronger than theyve ever been people across the gulf coast especially in new orleans need to understand that in a storm of this size there are serious risks of significant flooding
9363896 my message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9363897 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9363898 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time

9363900 i was worried about the kids we just couldnt stay
9363901 gustav is a large system similar to katrina the difference at this moment is that its asymmetric it doesnt have a uniform coverage like katrina
9363902 the army corps of engineers informs me that while the levees are stronger than theyve ever been people across the gulf coast especially in new orleans need to understand that in a storm of this size there are serious risks of significant flooding
9363903 my message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9363904 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9363905 keep the widest perspective and be ready to consider the off the beaten track program
9363906 students who are open to study in asia and latin america are having increasing opportunities
9363907 the advantages are that students can fit them into their academic schedule without any interruptions
9363908 and summers are less expensive because theyre less time overseas
9363909 students who take the time can find these scholarships easily by doing a month of research
9363910 you have to sit down and plan it really well
9363911 i planned a lot but some of the little things fell through
9363912 we try and get students to look at their program of study and how can they use opportunity overseas to complement that
9363913 even if its math or physics so that theres a match between what theyre doing at home and what theyre doing abroad
9363914 you cant get aboriginal history in the states it doesnt exist
9363915 why not take a course on how america is viewed abroad
9363916 new scenery helps with new ideas my professor would ask all the time what the truth was it made me think
9363917 keep the widest perspective and be ready to consider the off the beaten track program
9363918 students who are open to study in asia and latin america are having increasing opportunities

9363926 but once freshman students start meeting new friends the homesickness fades so that only a small portion have a serious problem
9363927 our residence assistants are very energetic enthusiastic students and they want to see their first year students succeed
9363928 i tell them to expect that some homesickness is normal because they are trying something new separation from family can be painful but it is also an opportunity to grow beyond their comfort zone and achieve a sense of independence
9363929 most students adjust within a few weeks but if there is a severe problem they need to know there are people to talk to
9363930 what the residence life program tries to do is create a homelike atmosphere so students feel like they belong
9363931 students in dormitories meet with others on their floors for social events and team building activities so they will not feel so isolated
9363932 some anxiety affects students the first days or weeks especially if they left a boyfriend or girlfriend at home
9363933 but if they connect with a small group in the dorm or in their major then they branch out and most of the time they adjust
9363934 there is a community assistant who lives on the dormitory floor with the students to help them adjust if homesickness becomes a real obstacle the student is referred to our counseling and psychological services
9363935 many of our students are from the surrounding counties and they can easily go home on weekends some come here rather than going out of state so they can stay closer to home
9363936 it may be that we can help students build their self esteem and establish who they are and then in a year and a half or two years they will be ready to transfer to a school where they live away from home
9363937 i am sure we have some students who start here because they know they would be homesick living away from home
9363938 in two years they will be more of an adult and look at the challenge differently
9363939 our residence life staff developed two groups to help students transition sisters circle and band of brothers that meet regularly
9363940 our experience is that students who think they will miss home stay close to home

9363978 clooney will play an unapologetic corporate downsizer whose untethered life is consumed by collecting air miles

9364000 we changed the name of the band to suit the venue
9364001 if we were doing a wedding we changed it to savoir faire we would call it chain gang for rock and roll places
9364002 i remember getting up onstage and singing my first song and the entire audience was talking
9364003 so i finished the song and i just started talking about the venue the things that were on the wall the pictures they had and it was funny once i did that and i caught their attention when i played they listened
9364004 the mc kind of came about by accident but now donohue lives on the west coast she has some projects of her own and it would be too crazy for her to relocate so ive gone back to my original idea
9364005 theyre going to say oh my god i remember when my mother made those italian cookies its kind of funny with a nostalgic throwback if you grew up that way

9364016 everybody who grew up in lodi remembers the feast as an annual rite of passage from summer to fall a time to go nuts and have fun before school starts
9364017 but as you get older it gives you a chance to see people you dont normally see and catch up with old friends
9364018 a statue of the saint is placed on a float and hand pulled by longtime members of the church and then quite a number of people follow it around the town
9364019 its worth it for the zeppoles and sausage and pepper sandwiches alone
9364020 its an italian treat that people dont make for themselves anymore so if you can only get it once a year you better believe there are going to be lines
9364021 we have the best zeppoles but its a secret recipe that has been in the family for generations
9364022 theres something about that smell of onions and peppers on the grill that bring me back to the years i came here as a child and had to spend every last penny on all the games

9364040 im sure his teammates welcome that its on him too
9364041 we all look to him for tips on how to get through to our guys when its all said and done hes going to be remembered here as a special leader like brian leonard
9364042 dont worry you dont have to know all of this tomorrow
9364043 i can tell all these guys watch him hes showing all of them you cant just show up and play this position
9364044 its because he seems like a tough quarterback but inside hes this really kindhearted guy
9364045 if theres any guy you can always depend on its mike
9364046 it said i was a competitive result driven athlete who doesnt like to lose
9364047 im sure his teammates welcome that its on him too
9364048 we all look to him for tips on how to get through to our guys when its all said and done hes going to be remembered here as a special leader like brian leonard
9364049 dont worry you dont have to know all of this tomorrow
9364050 i can tell all these guys watch him hes showing all of them you cant just show up and play this position
9364051 its because he seems like a tough quarterback but inside hes this really kindhearted guy
9364052 if theres any guy you can always depend on its mike
9364053 hes a 21 year old that we expect to be an important member of this organization
9364054 you have to perform at some point and it happens to be tuesday against a very good team lets see what he has well find out a lot about where were at with him in the next month
9364055 the idea of it being a category 4 and its strengthening in the gulf and heading in this direction
9364056 im not sure how strong it will be when it gets here im just preparing for the worst
9364057 its a good good good possibility that the house will flood
9364058 thats why were getting these sandbags now were going to try to protect something
9364059 were just going to deal with it when it comes
9364060 id rather stay and ride it out id be more worried on the road not knowing what is going on here
9364061 se han habilitado albergues en lastarria se constituy el comit comunal de emergencia y est en evaluaci n solicitar algunos recursos a nivel regional y nosotros a su vez a nivel nacional
9364062 in the first half both teams had more or less the same opportunities and in the second half i thought we started well
9364063 in the last 15 minutes they were pushing quite a lot it was a game that we could have won and so could they have done
9364064 it is not that we should have finished quicker i think you have to give credit to the defenders
9364065 it would have been nice to score but they had a good chance with robbie keane overall it was an equal match but one point is okay
9364066 it is nice to get a clean sheet having conceded five in the first two games that was the biggest plus point from today
9364067 it was a tough game and i thought they have come here and played a physical game
9364068 i think thats probably the right result we have a habit of scoring goals so i think we keeping a clean sheet is an absolute positive for us
9364069 once gustav makes landfall it will slow down and pose a significant rainfall and flooding threat to louisiana and texas
9364070 on the current path tropical storm force winds are expected to begin impacting the breaux bridge lafayette and crowley areas before noon on monday
9364071 i could imagine it i was hoping it was going to happen and thankfully it did
9364072 i thought he was excellent not only the goals but his general play every time he was in possession it looked like something was going to happen
9364073 he is going to bring a new element to our game and a new threat to opposition teams because he has proved once again that he is an exceptionally gifted football player
9364074 he is a better player now in his second spell at manchester city than he was when he left so we are going to reap the benefits of that he is only going to get better
9364075 i wanted to get him straight back in if at all possible and with the absence of martin petrov my hand was forced in some respects
9364076 but it was always my intention to give him a big part of the game i was obviously conscious of the fact that he hadnt had a great deal of football and i thought maybe he would tire at the end
9364077 i dont think he was particularly pleased when i took him off but i did it so he could acknowledge the crowd because he did exceptionally well today
9364078 there were some excellent personal performances in a very good team performance
9364079 shaun will get the headlines i am sure and rightly so because it is a fantastic story
9364080 but along with him i thought jo was excellent today and really was key along with a number of other personnel
9364081 a nova dire o do clube modificou o projeto que a diretoria anterior havia planejado para mim e foi justamente esse projeto que me fez escolher o palermo uma vez que v rios clubes importantes tinham interesse em me contratar diante disso o palermo aceitou me negociar e fui procurado por clubes da fran a e da alemanha optei ent o pelo lille
9364082 i hope and pray that everything is going to be all right

9364088 they dont want to be stuck here like the last time
9364089 what if the press was as hard on republicans as it is on democrats
9364090 the team did all the things we had planned to do from the outset
9364091 we forced the goals and played very well things are starting to roll now
9364092 in the last few weeks i have worked hard and this goal is a good indicator for me
9364093 i just tried to play to my very best at 2 0 we started to play at a lower standard i think we were a bit scared and could have finished the match better
9364094 the entry into the turkish market is another important step in terms of the use of natural gas for power generation in addition to the projects in romania and germany the turkish electricity market has a strong growth rate of around 10 per year new power plants are urgently required in order to cover the high demand this project will help ensure the supply security in turkey

9364100 while i feel hes under our nose here hes in an area thats extremely hard to get to its the vertical terrain its the dark terrain and its the trees the vegetation
9364101 you have to look for the perfect hiding spot and not just scour the open terrain
9364102 as the world marks the first anniversary of steves death i am heartened by bob hymans efforts to resolve the matter of steves disappearance
9364103 my best wishes are with him and his team and i hope for their safe return
9364104 if that aircraft didnt go straight down and kind of angled in under a stand of pine trees its going to take someone physically walking upon that scene to find it
9364105 its hard to believe in this day and age that someone could disappear like this until you go up in an aircraft and look at how rough the terrain is its absolutely amazing
9364106 and were looking for something thats possibly only a foot or two square
9364107 a window unit air conditioner or the size of a shopping cart or a washing machines it could just be scattered debris
9364108 if we dont find steve fossett people are going to be coming out here for the next 50 years until he is found
9364109 heavy rain in a time where were getting a lot of cliche games it is nice to see developers take risks and make a new game that is more story driven the graphics look astounding and the story seems very well done my favorite part is the gameplay because every decision you make in the game will have consequences that are either negative or positive and affect the rest of the game
9364110 heavy rain has good graphics and a lot of low res textures the gameplay is not unique but refreshing in this generation its even an envy considering kojima regrets he did not make his mgs4 cutscenes like hr i expect it to sell over one million copies and consider it a moderate hit in the time frame that hr is going to be released we will see other horror games too so there will be some competition and a lot of comparing the voice intuition is good and so is the rigging of the characters i will have to give it a solid 7 5
9364111 it would probably be star wars the force unleashed why ive been a star wars fan for as long as i can remember and ive been greatly interested in the force unleashed since it was first announced of course after playing the demo my mind had been made up and all fears of having another crappy star wars game were laid to rest it had amazingly exceeded all expectations i plan to buy it on day one but due to a lack of money it might have to wait
9364112 i am really happy with this result i would have loved to finish in the top 10 but given the circumstances and the steering problems i had this is a really great first experience i want to thank the entire team and my partners to have offered me such an opportunity
9364113 i think the man came in and wanted to go see a worship service in private the way things are its almost impossible to do that
9364114 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy

9364132 the problem with jealously is you ask yourself hypothetical questions like what if this person leaves me what if this person cheats on me and you let those questions echo in your brain and you become incredibly jealous
9364133 the problem is you never follow through and just answer the question and the answer to those questions is it will hurt and ill eventually be fine and ill meet somebody else

9364146 we continue to remind gulf coast residents about the importance of taking precautionary measures to prepare for an emergency situation or evacuation as gustav approaches our shores
9364147 if im elected im going to unleash hurricane sarah on k street corruption
9364148 actually ive none at the moment and thats because im not willing to do just any role that comes my way bollywood is going through a catharsis and possibilities are tremendous these days even married actresses are being offered roles that are tailor made for them
9364149 there is definitely an influx of heroines in the industry and getting noticed in this melee is undoubtedly difficult but then i feel bollywood is big enough for all of us and there is work for everybody though luck and right contacts do matter a lot considering my sister shilpa and i do not belong to any camp i feel we have done well for ourselves
9364150 in a way maybe but i am not acting in this film i am only producing it it is based on a very mature story that revolves around two women and manish jha would be directing it we will make an announcement shortly
9364151 i have no such plans i can never do a show like that as i will not be comfortable in such a setting nor can i stay away from my family for such a long time
9364152 i too am being offered a lot of work on tv but im not the one to follow trends so you will not be seeing me on the small screen
9364153 it is the media that is so busy marrying her off she has not made any such announcement as for me there are no boyfriends or marriage plans on the anvil as of now im happily single
9364154 you are not responsible for luck but you are for life
9364155 two boxes that were just delivered from dell computer huh
9364156 but honey since the moniter came with the computer ive decided to give you my old 20 flat panel instead of you getting eye strain wi9th that 17
9364157 i keep raising the number because it just keeps holding better than expected
9364158 people are going to arrive in the car park tomorrow morning and they are going to be faced with a pay and display machine
9364159 its bad enough that you have to pay for your ticket but now you have to queue to use a pay and display machine
9364160 the worst thing of all is that you elect to be cost aware and buy a weekly ticket but theres no guarantee theres going to be a car space for you every day
9364161 irish rail have presented no list of what car parks will be upgraded or in what order and what it will comprise its all aspirational
9364162 while i have no problem charging people who park at railway stations infrequently it is extremely unfair on those who have already bought weekly monthly or annual travel tickets for their commute so they should be exempt from the charge
9364163 many commuters either walk or cycle to their local station but this is not always possible and many have no alternative but to park and ride as there are very few bus links to railway stations
9364164 there has been no public consultation on this new system which will hit commuters who are already finding their take home pay reduced because of the spiralling cost of living
9364165 financially im kind of scared most of the time because what should happen if my health and my body fail
9364166 a bunch of them have dropped nebuad like hot potatoes
9364167 if youre good at dressing 7 to 14 year old girls it doesnt necessarily make you good at dressing teenage girl or a 25 year old

9364170 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
9364171 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
9364172 this has clear implications for their risk of sids our study shows that pre term infants make incomplete or delayed recoveries from interruptions to breathing
9364173 there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
9364174 there is stuff to talk about but youre not always talking

9364177 to explore the american perceptions of what vietnam means and what images it conjures up
9364178 vietnam was always abstract to me as it is to the american people
9364179 i went to vietnam to really figure out what this word vietnam means to me
9364180 many exhibits in the u s try to capture something about vietnam with a capital letter v that overwhelms viewers
9364181 exhibits like that dont correspond to reality they show some imaginary vietnam left over from movies
9364182 i chose 10 artists for the exhibit because i wanted it to include a variety of media including painting photography and video i felt each woman artist represented some aspect of vietnamese women in vietnam each has their own personal story yet each comes from a different background
9364183 i liked this exhibit because it focuses on recent art produced in the past decade which has been a time of tremendous change that provided women with new opportunities and new challenges
9364184 presenting visions of contemporary vietnamese society that departs from the expectations many americans have about a war torn society
9364185 just open your eyes look and have your own intuitive response
9364186 theres no war in this art its not about politics
9364187 these are individual women who have no blanket statement to make or overall message to give theyre artists and their works are what they have to say
9364188 emil it might have been better for you if the second sister had struck the cheek i just did with her little poisoned needle
9364189 was i unclear in my instructions to you on how to comport yourself
9364190 please have a seat emil dont embellish your answers unless and until i ask you to do so is that crystal to you
9364191 these two women have been commissioned to deliver an extremely important parcel on our behalf what made you think your handover of the datastrip and sliptrans remote was a good time to let your xenophobia bleed from your pores
9364192 as embellishments go that wasnt very inspiring secular genesis combats the tyranny of religion particuarly the vatican and everyone in the catholic union who is loyal to it we are not out to insult the ishmaeli or the mandarin or the isaacians
9364193 or if you should find yourself doing some recreational diving the atlanteans either
9364194 i was so focused on our spacefaring brethren i forgot to mention them the point is emil that we understand that you as an individual see whole genome manipulation as a crime against humanity that to you ishmaeli and others of their ilk are a sign of the elevation of science to godhood and thus a religion equally as repugnant as catholicism or any other true
9364195 honest about it good weve always known this about you and most of your real friends in the movement not that you would have put it so eloquently as i did but believe me weve done our homework and know you better than you do we welcomed you into our fold because frankly we agree with your view on that matter of some scientists fancying themselves gods
9364196 i dont think you want to thank me just yet emil the vatican controls two continents completely and a good chunk of a third might it not be logical to focus on the biggest threat first neo sapiens are just about dead last on our list of threats frankly the real threat is the science and the scientific justifications that make those species possible not the beings themselves
9364197 fortunately emil i think there is about nil chance of those two ishmaeli reneging on us it just wouldnt be professional so you havent scuttled our plans
9364198 but for even raising the spectre of such a botch what do you think i would feel tempted to do
9364199 kill you emil that you think i am either that predictable or so lacking in creativity simply astounds me no i am going to tape a packet to your chest that contains datastrips and hard docs of all your many ramblings on the systemgrid and conversations with certain people in secular genesis about the horrors of neo sapiens and their utter lack of humanity and i am going to send you back to the sisters of the red sun with a note that both that packet and you are a special gift to them our apology to them
9364200 there is no room for adjustment the window of opportunity is open but a crack are you certain emil has not compromised us
9364201 the hirebrand code lies above any other you know that once they take a contract they carry it out the sisters will do their task they would do so even if they discovered our package was set to wipe out an ishmaeli station home with their own parents aboard
9364202 but what what if we need the sisters in the future nothing in the hirebrand code requires them to agree to a job only to carry it out once accepted emil could have just jettisoned our chances of hiring them again and ive never seen a squad of hirebrands do what the twins can
9364203 then my next question would be can we trust that the hellpod will do what we need it to
9364204 but he has never failed to help advance us forward in our fight if he says the activation code will arm that pod it will arm that pod

9364215 we have to improve the final pass and that could be the difference
9364216 he will be a good addition it is nearly done
9364217 we dont know how long torres will be out for yet
9364218 well have to wait for the results of the scan on monday
9364219 we played very well in a very offensive way and with a defence that was very careful
9364220 up front we have players like bianchi and amoruso who showed they have a very good understanding but lets not get too excited
9364221 di michele hes a pupil of mine i will never sell him hes a very important player we will not let him go to roma
9364222 it was a really tough game but we expected to create more chances than we have done
9364223 but having said that we probably carved out the best chance the best piece of football in the game when john carew had a chance cleared off the line
9364224 but overall it was tough and i thought they have played to get something out of the game and i thought our effort was terrific we kept going right to the end
9364225 we have a habit of scoring goals but also letting a few in at the other end so i thought today if we kept a clean sheet we would win but it wasnt to be
9364226 but well learn a lot because thats a big tough game for us physically it was demanding and well have gained from that
9364227 it was fantastic as it has been ever since he came on as a substitue against
9364228 the reception he has got every single time home and away has always been fantastic and i think that will help
9364229 its not as if anyone holds grudges and we are more than pleased that hes with us for the foreseeable future
9364230 they had a full back going out to him all the time not bothering about whats going on in behind him and just to keep an eye on him
9364231 he might have been frustrated but its a massive compliment when a side like

9364233 there is a need to equip our law enforcers to win a war one must have superior strength weapon and is the same in the fight against criminality we need to adjust according to the enemy we are fighting training and equipment is needed
9364234 had mobile cars responded to the crime scene immediately they would be like sitting ducks to the robbers who are armed with m14 armalite rifles
9364235 the shotgun is enough it is more than effective in close distance encounter than the armalite rifles
9364236 i will initiate efforts for the procurement by the pnp and lgus of bulletproof vests to give our men extra protection in the war against criminality
9364237 they remain very bullish about the philippines and are here to stay for the long term
9364238 i am doing everything to help them settle it i want them to succeed and put in more money
9364239 we are preparing for the next batch of stas that we will buy from transco
9364240 we are set to buy these assets i understand that we are already talking with transco about this
9364241 by inference there is danger in reading too much into this or any analysis
9364242 why manufacturers would have ramped up production at such a torrid pace in the middle of a food crisis and with the prospect of a slowing economy is puzzling to say the least
9364243 a pluarlist political system and civil society competing in the world markets
9364244 it will not happen if it ever happens at all that russia will become the second edtion of say the united states or great britain for russians a strong state is not an anomaly which should be got rid of quite the contrary they see it as the guarantor of order and the initiator and the main driving force of any change
9364245 we must know our history know it as it really is draw lessons from it and always remember those who created the russian state championed its dignity and made it a great powerful and mighty state
9364246 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails

9364255 financially im kind of scared most of the time because what should happen if my health and my body fail
9364256 we have people who are healthier who are living longer and have more economic reasons to stay in the work force
9364257 on the employer side you have greater demand for experienced older workers that all adds up to longer work lives
9364258 but after i retired before they called me i really didnt have anything to do so when they called i jumped on it
9364259 if theres some project to be done next year when they call ill just go do it
9364260 its always been a good idea but right now it can be an especially good idea
9364261 you really dont want to be pulling more money out of a portfolio thats already down
9364262 to me the ideal would be 70 because you get the biggest benefit possible and all those additional years of employment and it keeps you going mentally and physically too
9364263 i feel blessed with the good health that i have but im a little bit bitter because i dont think i should be scared financially at 68

9364300 the first one that seems to me most obvious is the wave power project here in albany which in conjunction with the expansion of the wind turbine project will enable albany to become the first renewable energy city in australia
9364301 no more beautiful a place no more appropriate place could i imagine to establish as australias first renewable energy city
9364302 a liberal government will provide a fully transparent subsidy to the government owned utility for the project until the customer base and demand requirements grow
9364303 it generates a great deal of excitement in the potential for renewable energy and our quest to be the first local authority in the nation to be totally dependent on renewable energy
9364304 it is a step forward in the right direction we have a great deal of interest now in the potential for wave power and the associated desalination plant that can come with that

9364307 there is a real fear of serious repercussions that may attend any contradictory statement it is a well known fact that the presidents health is far from being ideal but virtually everyone including very senior people in the presidency are being kept in the dark over the matter

9364309 unsere beiden leute die um die meisterschaft k mpfen waren am ende vorne daher ist unsere strategie aufgegangen
9364310 der rennspeed war gut aber hinter ihnen hat man viel verloren da hat mattias boden gutmachen k nnen und uns alle drei berholt
9364311 er hatte die strategie die ich letztes jahr gefahren bin
9364312 nat rlich war mein plan vor den beiden mercedes zu bleiben aber beim letzten stopp hat hinten rechts etwas geklemmt und ich habe zeit verloren
9364313 dadurch war ich auf der geraden 15 km h zu langem
9364314 daher war es schwer die anderen hinter mir zu halten ich konnte deren pace nicht mitgehen
9364315 in der meisterschaft sieht es jetzt schlecht aus aber noch ist nichts verloren in der dtm ist alles m glich
9364316 wenn paul und jamie hilfe brauchen werde ich meinem team helfen
9364317 beim letzten rennen stand ich auf pole hier musste ich von platz zw lf starten daher musste ich mit der richtigen mischung aus attacke und vorsicht zu werke gehen
9364318 dann habe ich wieder attackiert und konnte drei autos auf der strecke berholen
9364319 fast h tte ich noch spengler erwischt aber meine reifen waren schon zu zerschlissen

9364322 they are saying if you dont stop meddling in our sphere of influence this is what we are going to do
9364323 back georgia and ukraine for nato membership and youll see the s 300 to iran it is a very powerful bargaining chip and a major deterrent to us actions in the region moscow is playing very strategically on americas obsession with iran
9364324 iran certainly thinks it has a deal and the israelis believe that a deal has been reached but that they can still block it
9364325 if tehran obtained the s 300 it would be a game changer in military thinking for tackling iran that could be a catalyst for israeli air attacks before its operational
9364326 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice

9364590 the daily brief customarily done in advance of a hurricane is being given by northcom
9364591 there is no allowance or legal authority for the department of defense to take any sort of control or command in this scenario in a hurricane dod like human services transportation etc all work for fema and the governor of the impacted state this is done for a very specific and important reason here in america we believe that governors should have control over their own states the federal government needs to be there to help but they absolutely do not move in and take over we also do not believe that the military should ever forcibly operate inside the united states unless they are under civilian control with northcom taking the lead on briefing the public its clear the bush administration wants to send the message that everything is under control instead to those that do this for a living the message is clear that everything is absolutely and completely broken

9364603 in queste ultime settimane ha detto ratzinger al termine della recita dell angelus dal palazzo apostolico di castel gandolfo la cronaca ha registrato laumento degli episodi di immigrazione irregolare dallafrica
9364604 non di rado la traversata del mediterraneo verso il continente europeo visto come un approdo di speranza per sfuggire a situazioni avverse e spesso insostenibili si trasforma in tragedia quella avvenuta qualche giorno ha aggiunto il papa ricordando i recenti casi di sbarco di clandestini che hanno prodotto numerosi morti fa sembra aver superato le precedenti per lalto numero di vittime la migrazione fenomeno presente fin dagli albori della storia dellumanit che da sempre pertanto ha caratterizzato le relazioni tra popoli e nazioni
9364605 lemergenza in cui si trasformata nei nostri tempi tuttavia ci interpella e mentre sollecita la nostra solidariet impone nello stesso tempo efficaci risposte politiche so che molte istanze regionali nazionali e internazionali si stanno occupando della questione della migrazione irregolare ad esse va il mio plauso e il mio incoraggiamento affinch continuino la loro meritevole azione con senso di responsabilit e spirito umanitario
9364606 senso di responsabilit devono mostrare anche i paesi di origine non solo perch si tratta di loro concittadini ha aggiunto benedetto xvi ma anche per rimuovere le cause di migrazione irregolare come pure per stroncare alle radici tutte le forme di criminalit ad essa collegate dal canto loro i paesi europei e comunque quelli meta di immigrazione sono tra laltro chiamati a sviluppare di comune accordo iniziative e strutture sempre pi adeguate alle necessit dei migranti irregolari questi ultimi poi vanno pure sensibilizzati sul valore della propria vita che rappresenta un bene unico sempre prezioso da tutelare di fronte ai gravissimi rischi a cui si espongono nella ricerca di un miglioramento delle loro condizioni e sul dovere della legalit che si impone a tutti
9364607 come padre comune sento il profondo dovere di richiamare lattenzione di tutti sul problema e di chiedere la generosa collaborazione di singoli e di istituzioni per affrontarlo e trovare vie di soluzione il signore ha concluso benedetto xvi ci accompagni e renda fecondi i nostri sforzi

9364611 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9364612 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9364613 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9364614 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9364615 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9364616 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9364617 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9364618 apprezzabili le sue lusinghe ma sconcertante le sue denigrazioni della classe dirigente delludc toscano

9364620 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9364621 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9364622 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9364623 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9364624 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9364625 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9364626 apprezzabili le sue lusinghe ma sconcertante le sue denigrazioni della classe dirigente delludc toscano
9364627 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9364628 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9364629 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9364630 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9364631 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9364632 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9364633 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9364636 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9364637 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9364638 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9364639 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre

9364644 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9364645 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9364648 tutta lestate lon enrico letta ha sostenuto pi volte limportanza di un dialogo aperto con ludc per una possibile alleanza in futuro sostenendo che tale opportunit sia lunica che permetta al suo partito di poter tornare a governare il paese
9364649 legittime aspirazioni ed analisi politica ineccepibile dal suo punto di vista tenendo anche conto della sua provenienza e della sua storia personale che chiaramente lo rende molto pi propenso a guardare al centro piuttosto che verso la sinistra radicale la quale per gli ha permesso per ben due volte di essere un autorevole esponente del governo prosegue comunque le sue lusinghe possono essere apprezzabili anche se relativamente interessanti abbastanza sconcertante invece quando lo si sente denigrare la classe dirigente delludc toscano alla festa del suo partito a modena
9364650 le sue affermazioni sono chiare e precise ha addirittura utilizzato un aggettivo che ci risparmiamo di ripetere che non lascia spazio a fraintendimenti
9364651 cotanto giudizio conclude certamente non toglier il sonno a noi militanti delludc toscano le nostre scelte le abbiamo gi fatte

9364670 well change our program and ill be announcing details of it in the next few hours
9364671 this is a very dangerous storm and we are all hoping for the best
9364672 i have older parents and living in south louisiana they think that they can handle any storm that hits so im going to bunker down and stay with them i never thought after rita that i would try to ride out another storm but here i am again
9364673 anybody whos caught looting in the city of new orleans will go directly to angola louisiana state penitentiary state
9364674 filtering or monitoring technologies designed to spot incidents of illegal downloads have forced many colleges to assign full time employees the job of tracking down the ip addresses of network users who might have violated copyright laws find out if those users are still enrolled in the university and make sure the alleged violators receive notice that the riaa is looking for them the software has been installed at campuses across the country after the recording industrys intensive lobbying effort for better network monitoring
9364675 dont just look at landfall look at those tropical storm force winds
9364676 thats when it will not be safe to be driving or be on the road
9364677 we need to take this storm very seriously whether its a strong category 3 or border line category 4 youre going to see strong tidal surge strong wind speeds the national hurricane center doesnt know precisely where the storm will strike louisianas coast
9364678 the important thing though is for people to take these warnings take this opportunity very seriously now is the time to get out of harms way
9364679 i strongly encourage people to heed those evacuations and warnings
9364680 i strongly strongly encourage those nursing homes that are non mandatory evacuation parishes to also evacuate
9364681 ich nehme den schmerz von dir wir sind vom selben stern
9364682 the register found u of i football players have been charged with at least 22 crimes since april 2007 some racking up multiple charges

9364687 its not that there isnt love its just that it comes after marriage
9364688 it would not be a stretch to say that shaadi the word for marriage in many indian languages is the first word a child in an indian family understands after mummy and papa
9364689 its clear that as they say hes just not that into me
9364690 a man who laughs easily and appears to hang on my every word
9364691 now that i can actually see him i realize hes kind of cute
9364692 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9364693 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9364694 i was worried about the kids we just couldnt stay
9364695 a number of the hospitals that originally planned to shelter in place have now decided they are going to actually try to evacuate their critically ill and medical needs patients
9364696 as a consequence weve had to increase the tempo of our air flights into new orleans in order to make sure that we can accommodate the flow were going to be watching this very carefully today
9364697 gustav is a large system similar to katrina the difference at this moment is that its asymmetric it doesnt have a uniform coverage like katrina
9364698 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9364699 in the united states we simply have not figured out how to fit the pieces together for a coordinated package that puts people on bikes
9364700 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that and is done in a serious way
9364701 senator mccain has already indicated that it would be inappropriate to have celebrations that things have to be scaled back
9364702 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9364703 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9364704 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does
9364705 you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9364706 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here its also about making decisions and be targeted in what she thinks she has a great mind and she has a very serious direction in where she goes
9364707 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9364708 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9364709 non bcs teams should get a shot at a championship every year
9364710 we never were able to get the defense a rest because we couldnt move the ball effectively
9364711 we were struggling offensively so i couldnt blame him a bit
9364712 we knew that both of us were going to play and it was going to be based on how coach felt
9364713 there was just a look in everyones eye its not something ive seen in the last couple years of utah football
9364714 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9364715 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9364716 chris is a tough guy i hope its not serious you hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground
9364717 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9364718 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9364719 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9364720 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9364721 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9364722 ah respectful ah cares a lot about the players cares a lot about the game tremendous

9364754 so you say you were one of the best at
9364755 i was pretty good myself back in the day too bad theres no way to prove such a claim
9364756 hell pitch a couple of innings out of the bullpen most likely
9364757 i think thats a playoff game scenario for pawtucket weve got a kid thats developing hes 21 hes run right through the system and weve talked about this with everybody else accumulating innings were trying to get him prepared knowing going forward there could be a need at the major league level for a starter a reliever you dont know
9364758 i came in the third inning against the scranton yankees this year after bartolo colon
9364759 other than that none its going to be a little bit different its going to be a fun experience i think ill adjust quickly to that role i dont think it will be too hard im looking forward to it
9364760 i think after the game i had 84 text messages 30 missed calls and 18 voicemails
9364761 and they were playing the game on television at home because im from chicago it was just icing on the cake
9364762 we have a plan in place for garcia which were really not ready to announce yet
9364763 he will not be immediately active im assuming at some point theres a good opportunity he would be but at this time we have a plan with him hes only pitched five innings so were gonna work around that some possibly simulate him tuesday
9364764 weve got what we got we called up what we called up
9364765 they left in 05 because of hurricane katrina and when they came back there wasnt much damage
9364766 but it was three weeks away from the house worrying about it and not knowing whats going on my dad said he didnt want to do that so theyre going to stay
9364767 you just pray and hope that if it does hit its minimal damage and minimal casualties
9364768 if they do flood and i flood it wont be good for anybody because thats the highest point of new orleans
9364769 its your home its where you live its distracting but you cant let things you cant control get in the way of your job and your life
9364770 every time you look at the tv turn the channel you see the name gustav hopefully its less than last time and theres no casualties no deaths no problems
9364771 i look at it as your life is precious and youve only got one of them
9364772 houses and money and things can be replaced but your life cant
9364773 i pulled my left hip and groin on the slow roller
9364774 ive never pulled anything in my life and it is something youve got to play through i told the manager im ready to go and well see what happens
9364775 i think its important to show the guys around here that sometimes you have to play through things and thats part of the game
9364776 you have to understand that not everybody is 100 percent but hopefully ill get a chance to go in there
9364777 celebrities dont have to worry about family budgets but we sure do

9365041 all the houses in our village have nearly collapsed and right now we are risking our lives to bring our belongings out of our homes
9365042 in our village there are 60 to 70 people who are seriously injured and staying in the playground of our elementary school
9365043 we dont have enough clothes or canvas to shelter ourselves so we have to sew plastic bags together
9365044 from yesterday to this afternoon weve only eaten once i am very frightened the year of 2008 is a year full of disasters
9365045 currently the biggest problem for us is a shortage of big tents and blankets we have already distributed more than 2 000 tents
9365046 we sent most of our people to the countryside to see if any people are still buried the situation there is still unclear now
9365047 there are so many disasters this year and the peoples mood is very low here
9365048 the earthquakes are a serious and somber topic around here
9365049 i saw dust in the air from the collapsed houses and just now i felt two aftershocks how can i not be worried
9365050 today the government sent people to the village to check but we only have four tents so i have to buy rain clothes and set up a shelter by myself our school was planning to start the new semester tomorrow but i think that must be postponed now

9365057 the habit of being proactive of personal vision means taking responsibility for your attitudes and actions
9365058 this is the habit of personal leadership meaning you begin each day or task with a clear understanding of your desired direction and destination
9365059 the most effective way to begin with the end in mind is to develop a personal mission statement philosophy or creed that focuses on what you want to be character and do contributions

9365074 im optimistic we were unlucky it was a strange and unusual match but i think they are the surprise of the day
9365075 i dont think we were missing much in the team we attacked for 90 minutes and were punished by the two chances bologna had
9365076 we could have been more compact and together but from a physical perspective we couldnt have done any more than that
9365077 the result was fair because we werent able to close out the match but a draw at a difficult ground is not a big drama
9365078 im not super happy but the team didnt play badly
9365079 the team did all the things we had planned to do from the outset
9365080 we forced the goals and played very well things are starting to roll now
9365081 in the last few weeks i have worked hard and this goal is a good indicator for me
9365082 if he is still in the squad yes he could play for us if not he wont
9365083 i dont know where he was because he was not here he was not in the right state of mind to play
9365084 the problem is the money is not for me it is for the club
9365085 we never put any blame on berbatov for the last two results
9365086 he wasnt there on the park so it was those on the park it was those on the pitch that were to blame and it was the same players that are responsible for putting in that great performance today and getting a fantastic result
9365087 if you ask arsene wenger he wants kalou as a centre forward and arsene is an intelligent man i need to follow this way
9365088 he wanted kalou one two or three months ago when we started negotiations for some players i said no you know what players i want and now you know what players arsene wants
9365089 lets say for the sake of argument in early march he drops dead then well have a white woman with a thin resume as opposed to a black man with a thin resume i want john mccain to live theyve got their exprience at the bottom of the ticket weve got our experience at the top of the ticket top of the ticket is better

9365091 taught me how to read and to say haltingly the humble prayers which i raised fervently to god
9365092 how many beautiful and pathetic scenes the world would witness without thee
9365093 he was a tall man lean and long necked with a sharp nose and a body slightly bent forward he used to wear a sinamay shirt woven by the deft hands of batangas women he knew by memory the grammars of nebrija and gainza to this add a severity which in my judgement i have made of him which is all i remember

9365099 we really deserved to win and we could have scored another couple of goals
9365100 it was very important for me to score i am extremely pleased that it finally happened
9365101 it would have been different in the olympics if i had run like this
9365102 but the past is the past and this is the present
9365103 i am very frustrated and disappointed with what happened in beijing
9365104 it was so frustrating having to watch rather than perform i know i would have been the man to put pressure on him bolt but thats what ive got to work towards now but i look forward to meeting usain and finishing my season strongly
9365105 its a bit difficult to come down off the high of the olympics and im still feeling a little tired
9365106 id have loved to have won but it just wasnt to be today
9365107 we all wanted to win the olympics but to beat the medalists here was nice
9365108 i had problems with my achilles tendon so this makes up for that now im looking forward to the rest of the season

9365169 the secular clergy will leave much to be desired because priests will become careless in their sacred duties lacking the divine compass they will stray from the road traced by god for the priestly ministry and they will become attached to wealth and riches which they will unduly strive to obtain how the church will suffer during this dark night lacking a prelate and father to guide them with paternal love gentleness strength wisdom and prudence many priests will lose their spirit placing their souls in great danger this will mark the arrival of my hour

9365270 tuvimos una actuaci n aceptable en donde nos mostramos seguros en la zona defensiva el equipo se ha desenvuelto muy bien hoy y es claro que hemos recuperado fuerzas
9365271 ellos comenzaron muy bien el encuentro y nosotros supimos ordenarnos en el medio campo adem s de que jens lehmann mantuvo bien el cero ellos se defendieron muy bien y fue una situaci n ideal irnos al descanso 2 0

9365293 its obvious that we would have to leave because if it was an elected government of iraq and weve been asked to leave other places in the world if it were an extremist government then i think we would have other challenges but i dont see how we could stay when our whole emphasis and policy has been based on turning the iraqi government over to the iraqi people

9365299 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9365300 reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great natural disaster
9365301 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention if necessary to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat
9365302 we can activate an email list of a couple million people who want to give back
9365303 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9365304 stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9365305 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job
9365306 im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue
9365307 we all learned from the terrible lesson that we saw after katrina and rita
9365308 we just hope that by the time this storm hits land that it has dissipated somewhat right now that doesnt appear to be the case

9365311 con un ministro presidente de pdvsa como ram rez ch vez ejerce un control casi absoluto sobre el paraestado y sobre la renta petrolera fuente principal del llamado socialismo petrolero
9365312 el presidente recurre a pdvsa porque es lo mejor que tiene para resolver la incompetencia de otros organismos p blicos antes lo intent con la fuerza armada nacional pero no le dio resultado
9365313 apoyarse en la empresa le permite no s lo tener los recursos sino que se le facilitan los tr mites administrativos y no se rige por las mismas normas que s tienen las partidas del presupuesto p blico
9365314 this is an absolutely retarded phrase there is not a shred of evidence that this is happening in venezuela ive lived here for over three years and know all kinds of families that do not belong to the psuv that absolutely hate chavez and have voted against him repeatedly and they still have full access to all the benefits of the government including state health care education subsidized food pensions etc etc

9365336 according to the swedish newspaper dagens nyheter morning after pill and abortion rates have risen significantly since 2000
9365337 i thought it was a great opportunity to see if i could really make it work
9365338 i think most editors are busy people and they use that as an excuse for not spending much time understanding social networking
9365339 but i think social networking is closer to our future than the print edition is so its worth a similar amount of time
9365340 we want to connect with our community in new ways
9365341 they really want to know whether someone is going to interact with you it validates it for the readers
9365342 it was a chance to show the new guy what you could do
9365343 he and i talked routinely you could definitely tell he gets the social media aspect and has good ideas
9365344 theres certainly more i would have done if i had been around for more than two days before it hit
9365345 a twitter search for what people were saying about the flooding could have told an interesting real time story
9365346 i had to try something i didnt understand because you learn more
9365347 i think most editors would say we need to do more with social networking and we dont get it enough
9365348 who needs the north star when you have a cow
9365349 if they need an artsy gimmick the writing is probably lacking
9365350 we are going to march into the arms of police whatever they are going to do is all right with us
9365351 we want to make it very clear we are pro soldier and anti war
9365352 we want to make it very clear we are pro soldier and anti war
9365353 i can lock up my house and scream about it or i can come here
9365354 this is going to be a very broad inclusive demonstration
9365355 we just really want to encourage people to come out
9365356 i saw some of the materials collected yesterday and those were not for noble purposes
9365357 its pretty clear that the point is to get organizers out of the picture
9365358 i am not personally going to speak to the intent of any of the things that the police claim that they found
9365359 but i think that many of them are common household items and others of them while maybe they dont fit into the social norms of other people are not a crime
9365360 theyve got to stop these random raids theyve got to stop putting people in jail and silencing reporters
9365361 if we live in a democracy then every voice should be heard and all of us should be really afraid that this is happening now
9365362 excuse me could you please tell me how to get to the high school
9365363 within the world of basketball within those trail blazers teams he was a jokester
9365364 he was a big loving teddy bear at times guys got frustrated because he didnt have a mean streak
9365365 he was just a great guy he loved the team atmosphere loved being a teammate in those successful blazer teams
9365366 youre going to laugh but i think thats a good foul i think that you knock pau gasol around early and let him know that hes going to be in a physical contest he likes to be a finesse player the knock on him has been that he does not like contact
9365367 what i find watching international ball the problem is the officiating is wildly inconsistent
9365368 the opening ceremony the olympic ideal and the real world
9365369 jets acquire favre maybe he will even play for them
9365370 theres a gigantic difference between john mccain and barack obama and between me and i suspect my vice presidential opponent
9365371 where is that person who said that who said that
9365372 would you make sure jill hears that you know what i mean i just want to make sure she hears that i havent heard that in a long long long time and hanging around this lean young looking guy is making me feel pretty old
9365373 i thought i was in pretty good shape til i hung out with this guy
9365374 let me end on a serious note here on a serious note i was a pretty good football player man we ought to talk we ought to talk a little bit after this ok

9365388 pele makes the land and she takes the land away
9365389 i dont know the answer but some sort of understanding has to be reached with these commercial operators who say theyre doing everything to protect the reefs
9365390 its a little hard to just go on their word we know the coral reefs are suffering every study thats been done on reefs shows that theyre in desperate condition
9365391 my sources my inspiration link back to my ancestors who happen to be hawaiian ukrainian spanish french and english
9365392 but i was born and raised here i am much more familiar with and closest to my hawaiian roots
9365393 what makes me a hawaiian artist thats the first question i had to face for my mfa
9365394 we need to talk to our kupuna look at the museum artifacts then move on
9365395 if you were born and raised here but had no hawaiian blood
9365396 but it upsets me when non hawaiians paint or sculpt hawaiian themes but arent in the least bit educated in the culture im a printmaker i use an etching press used in the eighteenth century but i studied mamas fish house

9365399 governor palin needs to take a close look at wildlife management practice in her state and restore the use of sound science
9365400 she said would heed the will of the public but its increasingly clear shes only listening to that segment that is willing to sacrifice alaskas natural heritage for the benefit of a few
9365401 willing to sacrifice alaskas natural heritage for the benefit of a few
9365402 theres very little doubt that we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action i am directing programme changes for beginning on monday nights activities at our convention
9365403 i think that with a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out what is going on is fine
9365404 shes had 12 years of elected office experience including travelling to kuwait including being involved in these issues im so proud that she has displayed the kind of judgment and she has the experience and judgment as an executive
9365405 if they can become patriotic and believe in whats happening in south africa and not look for their honey outside of the borders and offer support rather than stomping on people who gave them hours and hours of joy last year and this year we as a nation will grow much better
9365406 we didnt go out there to show them that they were wrong we went out there to exactly showcase our talents and the belief that we do have in ourselves
9365407 the same people who threw their robes on the ground when jesus rode on a donkey were the same people who crowned him and hit him with sticks and stuff like that and were the same people who said afterwards how we shouldnt have done that hes the son of god
9365408 in the four films starring kate we are given dream sequences that invite us to imagine how we might fulfil her desires
9365409 the dreams are beautifully crafted fantasies each with an eerie atmosphere that brings us into a serene la la land where we feel free to imagine pleasing kate
9365410 the camera closes in on her bulging behind as it rides up and down and shakes from side to side
9365411 tease out mens deepest fantasies through the power of suggestion
9365412 my students are so excited to get their book orders
9365413 they read the books during class and at home they just dont want to stop i love to see them developing such a love of reading
9365414 i remember seeing kids in my class who didnt order books and thinking they dont like books isnt that crazy
9365415 a lot of families couldnt have that as a priority
9365416 but it entirely changed the attitude of children toward reading
9365417 the kids had a chance to figure out if their books would be about sharks or snakes or babysitters club or captain underpants a big favorite on the elementary school circuit
9365418 there were no limitations on the books they could choose
9365419 its always been an incredible place to us so it made sense to want to involve the maui community
9365420 i liked picking out my own books now i have a big pile of books in my house i read my books with my little sister sometimes i let her read books by herself
9365421 i know summer is a time for fun outside but im not going to goof off im reading reading is my favorite
9365422 i have fun reading them and im getting smarter at the same time
9365423 to offer this enjoyment to all the children who may not otherwise afford it not only warms my heart but makes me feel like im doing a huge service to maui county
9365424 these kids may have never had the opportunity to discover why reading is fun
9365425 an interest in books can start in the classroom and it spreads from there into the home
9365426 the transcend study demonstrates the value of telmisartan in people who are unable to tolerate angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
9365427 although the benefit is of moderate size there is an impact on a range of outcomes including the composite of cardiovascular death myocardial infarction and strokes as well as cardiovascular hospitalizations given the large proportion of people who are unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor the use of telmisartan would be clinically important
9365428 were excited about this and were actively moving forward toward clinical trials
9365429 thats just an example of the power of these microfluidics automation technologies that one or two people working together can actually screen very large numbers of compounds
9365430 big pharmaceutical companies have very large teams and a lot of infrastructure were trying to reinvent the whole process
9365431 clemizole does have the potential to be part of a cure because the idea is not to use it on its own but as a cocktail component
9365432 neither jeffs group nor mine could have done this on our own
9365433 it was enabled by both of us bringing our pieces to the table the questions he was asking and the technology we developed
9365434 telomerase is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human tumors but inactive in most normal cells
9365435 that means a drug that deactivates telomerase would likely work against all cancers with few side effects
9365436 once we found that the gene from this organism expressed the protein in the quantities we needed we were able to move quickly
9365437 for the first time we can see how telomerase assembles at the end of chromosomes to initiate telomere replication
9365438 ive always been interested in understanding on a molecular level the function of protein nucleic acid assemblies and using that information in the treatment of human disease
9365439 telomerase because of its important role in cancer and aging was an obvious target for me
9365440 it required a lot of perseverance and effort but we really wanted to do this
9365441 as we continue to find genes that interact with each other and with environmental influences in this complex chronic disease we are building the foundation for personalized treatments tailored to a patients genetic profile
9365442 we will resequence the gene regions we have identified to pinpoint the causative mutations in these genes
9365443 we strongly suspect one gene will provide a compelling target for drug development given whats known about its biology
9365444 although the gene variants we found may have a stronger signal in pediatric ibd than in adult onset ibd we do not believe them to be limited to varieties of the disease that begin in childhood
9365445 as we better understand the complex gene interactions in ibd we may be able to diagnose patients by their genetic profile to predict who will better respond to anti tnf drugs
9365446 if better knowledge of the disease pathway enables pharmaceutical companies to develop anti tnf drugs in pill form the medications will be easier to deliver as well as more customized to each patient
9365447 every time i look at my own page it seems too cluttered for my own taste
9365448 fussball ist mehr als nur ein sport fussball ist euphorie religion und droge zugleich
9365449 we used to cut down many trees for agricultural use which brought us a lot of hardship including windstorms decreased rainfall and increased solar intensity
9365450 the amount of rainfall has dramatically increased in the last five years and heat from the sun has reduced and we now have better yield
9365451 serious concern for future economic development and sustained rural livelihoods
9365452 we were doing everything by ourselves but we realised that we were not achieving much and we now involve local communities around the forests without whose help we would fail in our conservation efforts
9365453 kakum is one of the last vestiges of the upper guinea forest and one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world
9365454 the government now devolves more power to the forest communities in conserving the forests and shares the revenues coming from the forests and the results are quite remarkable
9365455 despite the delay in receiving the ecotourism royalty we are willing to continue with the conservation project and we want the government to bring more of the seedlings it promised us to plant because we have seen the benefits we can derive from them
9365456 the emergency into which the wave of migration has recently developed demands our solidarity but at the same time needs an effective political response
9365457 excuse me could you please tell me how to get to the high school
9365458 when i was growing up after vatican ii the church was more open to questioning

9365463 it remains likely that gustav will prove to be a worst case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage
9365464 the industry is much more prepared and taking things much more seriously thats why so much has been shut down so quickly
9365465 there will be a rally when the market opens on sunday but hopefully things wont be too bad and we can sell off tomorrow monday
9365466 the federal government wishes to restate that mr president is very well and healthy he is in good health to steer the affairs of the state
9365467 our retail businesses on both sides of the border which again produced more than 90 per cent of our earnings this quarter continued to perform very well providing td with a solid base of consistent earnings
9365468 in what continues to be a tough environment for banks were showing our strategy is working
9365469 the bank turned in a solid performance this quarter driven in particular by a strong contribution from the financial markets segment and good growth in business volumes at personal and commercial
9365470 jesse mccartney performed on the today show friday as part of their songs of the summer
9365471 the government recognises concerns that the mergers and acquisitions provisions of the trade practices act do not enable the accc to effectively deal with incremental acquisitions
9365472 consideration of the need for legislative reform in relation to creeping acquisitions is an election commitment and the release of this discussion paper is an important step in ensuring that all the issues can be examined
9365473 we estimate that sleepiness contributes to about a third of single vehicle fatal motor vehicle collisions
9365474 about half the eligible sample were shift workers they were profoundly sleepier than the non shift workers at the time of the accident based on detailed questions
9365475 if you are sleep deprived for 24 hours that is the equivalent to a blood alcohol level of about 0 1
9365476 in actuality nothing can take away your free will in this world it is the most fundamental gift of providence the very nature of this reality we call life is designed to conserve this gift through its paradoxes its challenges to humans of good and evil of choices no one is forced by god or ordained by god to do that which he or she does not wish to do no one is chosen as an instrument of god in other words if the nature and direction of that usage runs against that persons nature and will as the talmud teaches in the way a person wishes to go he is directed or one who seeks the impure the way is open to him nothing has power over ones free will unless something in that persons heart is open to it and submits to it
9365477 all they have to do is call me and ask me for something like that and its an immediate yes
9365478 we dont have the time to go out and be the true workers which are the volunteers that spend a year in africa
9365479 we dont have that liberty but we can definitely do our part back here just to get people to realize what its all about
9365480 i made a choice to run a junior team in quebec city and because of that i didnt have time to go to the bell centre
9365481 i would have like to have gone to some events like the jersey retirements of bob gainey and serge savard i would have liked to go see ex rempart alexander radulov play against the canadiens but each time it was impossible
9365482 i dont think the other lenders need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing by families under pressure and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9365483 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week therell be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9365484 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9365485 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them theyre doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9365486 it really denies the uniqueness of who the indigenous people are and what their contribution to this country can be in their own right as if they have nothing to contribute except the absorption of the culture that the west has offered to us its a pretty damnable statement if thats the case
9365487 were not living normal lives were totally over represented in the social indicators were dying a lot younger we dont have the education opportunities people are living below the poverty line in many parts of australia it is not just those in northern australia who are battling to make ends meet
9365488 it really promotes the urban remote divide and that is really quite wrong
9365489 im just disappointed that he should go out on a note like that when we know theres been a lot of emphasis on remote areas and the difficulties there but there are huge huge difficulties in urban australia and we need to bridge that gap
9365490 they always say he was a maverick and this made me think well he really is he went all the way to alaska there arent that many people up there they dont have that many electoral votes and he picked this person i know people will say shes inexperienced but shes been a governor for 20 months thats more experience than obama has
9365491 no one in my office has any idea about her and the only comment im hearing which is not good is that shes a woman and thats why she was picked
9365492 its so blatantly a political move picking a woman at all and then picking a woman with so little experience when he keeps ramming obama about his experience
9365493 we made it very clear today that there would be no delay of issues and no partial agreements
9365494 we are working to achieve a joint historic israeli palestinian document
9365495 i make them as quickly as i can quicker than the other fellow if i can
9365496 often my haste is a mistake but i live with the consequences without complaint
9365497 dan quayle had not been briefed you know and prepared for some of the questions
9365498 he said give me pluses and minuses on each of these people
9365499 high tension towers were twisted and down roofs blown off entire towns schools destroyed and in palacios even the baseball stadiums walls were gone
9365500 it felt like here was a democrat that found his spine that was going to stand up that was going to fight back
9365501 their treatment of women throughout the decades leading up to even now this sort of attitude that women are so stupid that theyre going to just vote for somebody because theyre a woman even though this woman is against the very things that women are for and the things that women need i mean they really think women are i guess just dumb or something i dont think women across the country right now are feeling honored by this event today
9365502 they should start here before they begin trying to fix things in other countries
9365503 germany because of the fact and the perception of a special relationship with russia is the only one who can influence russian debate
9365504 russians also believe that germans understand them best because theyve been through a big war and know what humiliation means
9365505 the german trauma of the second world war is something we will never be rid of
9365506 we dont want to intervene too much but maybe putting some pressure on russia is the right idea
9365507 we estimate that sleepiness contributes to about a third of single vehicle fatal motor vehicle collisions
9365508 about half the eligible sample were shift workers they were profoundly sleepier than the non shift workers at the time of the accident based on detailed questions

9365512 victoria police has an attrition rate of less than 3 per cent one of the lowest in australia
9365513 retirements are always going to be there but when you get experienced people resigning in what is traditionally the middle of their service and the views that theyre expressing are those of frustration and disillusionment something isnt right
9365514 people might be lining up in their thousands to join the police force but once they get in there and see what its like its not like what they thought it was going to be
9365515 working in an under resourced environment for a decade or more is going to take its toll on anyone
9365516 members have had thousands of dollars spent on them by way of training in all manner of things and now theyre disillusioned and leaving for other jobs or considering their options
9365517 you can swim all day in the sea of knowledge and never get wet
9365518 if we take another hit like katrina i dont think there is any way we could rebuild again
9365519 if what happened during katrina happens again im never coming back you just get tired of it
9365520 ragged storm structure will likely prevent gustav from rapidly intensifying according to forecasters at the national hurricane center
9365521 it will lose that window for picking up some real potent high octane energy
9365522 this is not the one to play with you need to be scared
9365523 last resort shelter as there was during katrina when thousands suffered inside a squalid superdome
9365524 even if it falls just west of new orleans people in that whole neighborhood are going to feel the effects of a major major hurricane
9365525 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9365526 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9365527 then jesus told his disciples if any want to become my followers let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me
9365528 this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy yet such a person has no root but endures only for a while and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word that person immediately falls away
9365529 this is the one who hears the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word and it yields nothing
9365530 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now
9365531 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of the president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9365532 i hope to be able to get to louisiana as soon as conditions permit
9365533 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9365534 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9365535 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that and is done in a serious way
9365536 were going to have a convention we have to endorse a candidate but it may be a different convention than what we thought of a couple days ago
9365537 keep in mind those areas are under a mandatory evacuation so right now they couldnt go home anyway
9365538 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does
9365539 you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9365540 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here its also about making decisions and be targeted in what she thinks she has a great mind and she has a very serious direction in where she goes
9365541 i saw the little mermaid when i was nine so it was part of our culture
9365542 i didnt like the idea that mermaids werent supposed to have a soul and humans did

9365551 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9365552 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them theyre doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9365553 it really denies the uniqueness of who the indigenous people are and what their contribution to this country can be in their own right as if they have nothing to contribute except the absorption of the culture that the west has offered to us its a pretty damnable statement if thats the case
9365554 were not living normal lives were totally over represented in the social indicators were dying a lot younger we dont have the education opportunities people are living below the poverty line in many parts of australia it is not just those in northern australia who are battling to make ends meet
9365555 it really promotes the urban remote divide and that is really quite wrong
9365556 im just disappointed that he should go out on a note like that when we know theres been a lot of emphasis on remote areas and the difficulties there but there are huge huge difficulties in urban australia and we need to bridge that gap
9365557 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country

9365563 there have been changes in the cost of funding in recent times and they will have an impact over time so over time the banks should be coming down over and above any cut in the reserves rate

9365575 automated digital libraries how effectively can computers be used for the skilled tasks of professional librarianship
9365576 with disappointingly few exceptions the digital libraries community has paid little attention to the questions of how to manage these very large collections and how to support researchers in using them academic libraries and digital library researchers have largely abandoned large scale digital libraries to commercial companies and the not for profit internet archive this is doubly unfortunately it isolates universities from a vibrant area of research and innovation and it forces libraries into alliances with commercial companies that they may regret in the long term

9365591 hurricane gustav slowed to category 3 status with top winds near 125 mph early sunday but forecasters expected it to regain strength later in the day the national hurricane center upgraded a watch to a hurricane warning for over 500 miles of gulf coast from cameron la near the texas border to the alabama florida state line meaning hurricane conditions are expected there within 24 hours

9365594 who said that would you say that again for my wife
9365595 would you make sure jill hears that i havent heard that in a long long long time
9365596 we want to make it very clear we are pro soldier and anti war
9365597 i can lock up my house and scream about it or i can come here
9365598 this is going to be a very broad inclusive demonstration
9365599 we just really want to encourage people to come out

9365604 we plan to be as flexible as possible and do what we can do
9365605 we have 45 000 people attending and most are already here maybe well have to make some adjustments
9365606 life is like this this is inevitably going to change the convention in some way we cant expect the convention to go ahead in a normal way
9365607 first things first we should focus on the needs of the emergency the convention hoopla will have to come second
9365608 the conventions message will get out im not going to worry the message wont get out
9365609 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9365610 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9365611 we dont want to solicit a bunch of canned goods that cant get there or you know bottles of water where they already have water
9365612 the thing that i am always concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether we are drawing resources away from folks on the ground

9365616 telomerase is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human tumors but inactive in most normal cells
9365617 that means a drug that deactivates telomerase would likely work against all cancers with few side effects

9365619 for the first time we can see how telomerase assembles at the end of chromosomes to initiate telomere replication

9365625 clemizole does have the potential to be part of a cure because the idea is not to use it on its own but as a cocktail component
9365626 were not talking about something catastrophic but we could see a much bigger response in terms of sea level from the greenland ice sheet over the next 100 years than what is currently predicted
9365627 weve never seen an ice sheet disappear before but here we have a record
9365628 for planning purposes we should see the ipcc projections as conservative
9365629 we think this is a very low estimate of what the greenland ice sheet will contribute to sea level
9365630 as we continue to find genes that interact with each other and with environmental influences in this complex chronic disease we are building the foundation for personalized treatments tailored to a patients genetic profile

9365637 what this brings is a spirit of reform and change that is vital now in our nations capital
9365638 eighty four percent of the american people think the countrys on the wrong track in our party we have corruption we have former members of congress residing in federal prison so its not surprising to me that weve seen an incredible invigoration around our party and around the nation not just republicans but democrats by the way in the last day and a half or whatever its been we have raised 4 million on the internet i wish i had taken her a month ago
9365639 got the right judgment she doesnt think like senator obama does that iran is a minor irritant
9365640 she knows that the surge worked and succeeded and she supported that
9365641 senator obama still still to this day refuses to acknowledge that the surge has succeeded shes been commander in chief of the alaska guard that has served back and back in fact as you know shes got a son whos getting ready to go but shes had the judgment on these issues that senator obama hes had all the wrong judgments governor palin understands these issues and she understands the challenges that we face
9365642 travelling to kuwait including being involved in these issues and look im so proud that she has displayed the kind of judgment and she has the experience and judgment as an executive shes run a huge economy up there in the state of alaska twenty percent of our energy comes from the state of alaska and energy is obviously one of the key issues for our nations security
9365643 as governor she has had enormous responsibilities none of which senator obama had when she was in government he was a community organizer when she was taking tough positions against her own party senator obama was voting present 130 times in the state legislature on every tough issue whatever it was she was taking them on thats the kind of judgment that im confident that we need in washington
9365644 well im a woman palins a woman i guess i will vote for mccain
9365645 they need the education and training particularly since more and more women are heads of their households
9365646 flood our already over burdened court system and burden employers who will have no choice but to charge consumers more for goods and services in order to pay for the swarm of new lawsuits that will only serve to fatten the pockets of trial lawyers
9365647 a s a general rule the available literature tends to focus more on women than minorities in the legal profession
9365648 as for the bridge to nowhere she did say no which upset republicans who had been trying to get that for years
9365649 people tearing palin apart without even looking at her record are just desperate
9365650 does mccain think sarah palin is better qualified for vp than for instance condi rice
9365651 but i heard more than one commentator on the sunday morning shows that palin has the most experience of all four on the major party tickets in the areas of energy and oil
9365652 but since yesterday after i read lots of news about palin i changed my mind she is just that kind of woman i like energetic sports loving family oriented kids loving hunnting conservative the more news i read about her the more i like her
9365653 its like asking the guy who runs a 7 11 to become ceo of exxonmobile
9365654 abraham lincoln didnt have much experience before election and it was no problem
9365655 we want to make it very clear we are pro soldier and anti war
9365656 i can lock up my house and scream about it or i can come here
9365657 this is going to be a very broad inclusive demonstration
9365658 we just really want to encourage people to come out
9365659 ot zka stavebnej pol cie je st le aktu lna
9365660 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9365661 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9365662 we dont want to solicit a bunch of canned goods that cant get there or you know bottles of water where they already have water
9365663 the thing that i am always concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether we are drawing resources away from folks on the ground
9365664 im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue
9365665 its okay youre not a freak and youre not alone
9365666 i dont want to go to mexico my life is here this is everything i know
9365667 now that im home schooled ive all but lost touch with the outside world
9365668 if you would have asked me three months ago i would have told you i wanted to change to make this all go away but i dont want to change now i want to be with jessica
9365669 we are certain that one of the bodies is that of jill foster and the other is believed to be that of a man
9365670 the post mortem examination did show that jill died from a gunshot wound to the head further tests are needed to try and establish a cause of death for the other body
9365671 im still hoping its not true because i honestly dont know what ill do without her
9365672 it was always a good business he just screwed it up
9365673 have the courage to disconnect yourself from your material things you cannot protect yourself against what mother nature is going to throw at us
9365674 we are going to see storm surge on the west bank like we have never seen before
9365675 im all american but my family history is palestinian so we are used to evacuating
9365676 new orleans evacuated 10 000 people saturday and the estimate is 30 000 people needed to leave
9365677 the challenge seems to be that people arent listening or they are listening and deciding to stay all the coastal parishes are in very significant harms way while you can it is critical to move
9365678 if people are scared they should be scared this is not a drill we just need you to move now
9365679 an extremely dangerous storm surge of 18 to 25 feet more than six meters above normal tidal levels is expected near and to the east of where the center of gustav crosses the northern gulf coast
9365680 if one major deep water production platform is destroyed youre talking about a billion dollar or more loss
9365681 if its multiple rigs and platforms in a variety of water depths then were talking billions of dollars
9365682 contrast that to obamas bitter clingers obama just lost blue collar white democratic voters in pennsylvania and other states
9365683 remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9365684 did i wake up in a parallel universe i am absolutely shocked
9365685 but the danger for democrats is if they get overconfident and ridicule her they could create a backlash of sympathy for her
9365686 where is that person who said that would you say that again for my wife
9365687 could you make sure jill hears that i just want to make sure she hears that
9365688 i havent heard that in a long long long time and hanging around this lean young looking guy is making me feel pretty old you know what i mean i thought i was in pretty good shape until i hung out with this guy you know what i mean
9365689 let me end on a serious note i was a pretty good football player weve got to talk further after this
9365690 joseph fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her if of the holy ghost
9365691 i will marry you honey i will take you for my wife
9365692 brother branham is that you say you said youd only answer that by the bible
9365693 joseph her husband being a just man her espoused husband already called her husband joseph her husband being a just man was mindedly to put her away privately on this wise but before they came together she was found with a child of the holy ghost
9365694 joseph gabriel the archangel visit me and told me that i was going to conceive knowing no man
9365695 whosoever marries her that is put away liveth in adultery
9365696 a woman that bobbed her hair her husband had a right and a bible right to divorce her
9365697 now if they would cut it if theres something wrong they had to cut their hair
9365698 let them take a razor and shave it all off and make her hair real slick until it come out their head
9365699 whosoever putteth away his wife and marries another except it be for the cause of fornications commits adultery
9365700 be it well known to you i have it in mine if any couples are joined otherwise than gods word does allow their marriage is not lawful i will require and will charge you both as youll surely answer in the day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed if either of you know any impediment why you should not be lawful joined together do you now confess it
9365701 can a man marry a woman and be divorced by her and then marry another and if both of them marry another are they both committing adultery
9365702 you have set your limbs apart and taken in every man that come by and youve played the part of whoredom with me and ill put you away in divorce
9365703 oh if the wife or the husband either one has committed adultery either one of them can be put away and married again
9365704 o god will my little rebekah or sarah ever come to that
9365705 whosoever marries her that is put away liveth in adultery
9365706 were trying to break the negative image of the construction worker
9365707 wherever the celebrities are thats where the celebrity magazines are going to be
9365708 you have to tap into the water cooler stories that the people are talking about
9365709 if you dont you wont have much relevance for your viewers
9365710 hillary was on these shows as much as we could get her on them
9365711 they have a large audience and at least for some of the folks watching it its a main source of news and information
9365712 you want to work with them in a way thats appropriate
9365713 you dont want to do interviews that are goofy or diminishing but they have a great audience and they probably arent interested in talking to john mccain that much
9365714 were trying to break the negative image of the construction worker
9365715 we take care of all the hr all they do is manage their business
9365716 i want to know how i can make your facility more profitable
9365717 the more profit you make and the more successful we are at west point then the more capital theyre going to give west point to expand we get more jobs we all survive we all win one cant win without the other
9365718 i pay a union contractor to do the work i dont have the time
9365719 ian is a very determined guy i love his attitude and what he did at the open that back nine he played with the intention to win and had that emotional feeling
9365720 ive been watching paul play and he has been playing absolutely the best through the summer
9365721 he has an extremely good record in the ryder cup and going back the walker cup
9365722 nick rang me after my last round at gleneagles to say that i wasnt going to be one of his picks and i simply wished him all the best
9365723 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9365724 im sore this morning but it was an amazing adventure and im glad we got to do it
9365725 this was such an extreme swim it started out cold and just got colder but this beautiful canal the guys up here with me and all the people following the journey online made me want to keep going
9365726 it was like somebody put the freezer on and he just got slower and slower he had the best attitude and was even on track to make it but we had to take him out it was just too risky
9365727 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9365728 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9365729 its a goal but i want to win a grand slam
9365730 i just got a bit more defensive i felt a little bit tired she took advantage of that
9365731 a milestone in the consolidation of the german banking sector
9365732 it was just like loch lomond at the end i had to get up and down from the trap to win there but this winning putt was longer
9365733 my favorite moment in todays race was coming back through disneys california adventure and seeing mrs incredible and sully cheering us on
9365734 i had to make my way through all the other runners
9365735 but it was a great race with so many people out there cheering us on that really made it special
9365736 we are constrained to express grave concern over the press statement attributed to undersecretary of health mario villaverde that the department of health will now promote the nationwide use of condoms allegedly as a means to prevent the spread of hiv aids
9365737 we must encourage men and women to live morally upright lives and to practice marital fidelity and chastity within and outside marriage instead of telling them that risky sexual behavior is acceptable provided they wear a condom to protect them and their partners from hiv aids
9365738 weve gotta win a ballgame and mauers been swinging pretty good

9365746 were going to go with the biggest story of the day tomorrow
9365747 and right now the biggest story of the day is the storm
9365748 the republican national committee has done a good job at being sensitive to not wanting to throw a party at a time the gulf coast is under siege
9365749 were trying to approach the convention with the same degree of sensitivity
9365750 my thumbs are numb from the blackberry exchanges between yesterday and today in terms of shifting our coverage

9365752 you have to tap into the water cooler stories that the people are talking about
9365753 if you dont you wont have much relevance for your viewers

9365758 we are fighting this war this is our war there is no question of americas dictation
9365759 this is not a war but jihad and this is our faith that rewards for good deeds and that is multiplied during the holy month
9365760 financially im kind of scared most of the time because what should happen if my health and my body fail
9365761 we have people who are healthier who are living longer and have more economic reasons to stay in the work force
9365762 on the employer side you have greater demand for experienced older workers that all adds up to longer work lives
9365763 but after i retired before they called me i really didnt have anything to do so when they called i jumped on it
9365764 if theres some project to be done next year when they call ill just go do it
9365765 its always been a good idea but right now it can be an especially good idea
9365766 you really dont want to be pulling more money out of a portfolio thats already down
9365767 to me the ideal would be 70 because you get the biggest social security benefit possible and all those additional years of employment and it keeps you going mentally and physically too
9365768 i feel blessed with the good health that i have but im a little bit bitter because i dont think i should be scared financially at 68
9365769 we need someone young preferably female whos pro life evangelical and likes to shoot guns get on it
9365770 i mean i think that she already has more executive experience than sen obama and sen biden combined
9365771 she had to make decisions all sen obama has had to do is talk thats all he does
9365772 wolf i hate to break it to you but you dont get national experience by being on the sunday talk shows she has more experience than barack obama
9365773 i keep raising the number because it just keeps holding better than expected
9365774 this is kind of an inauspicious end to a really incredible summer

9365848 this is an undisputed victory not only for altech but for the whole of the south african telecommunications industry and we are proud to have been pioneers in breaking competitive ground in what has been a long closed playing field
9365849 even if there is an appeal i think the issue has been thoroughly debated and the decision will come out in our favour the previous process included a limited number of operators and was detrimental to the industry

9365878 palin tends to oversimplify complex issues it is clear that she has not paid much attention to the nitty gritty unglamorous work of government of gaining consensus and making difficult compromises she seems to be of the view that politics should be all rather simple that often appeals to the wider public but frustrates those who see themselves as laboring in the less glamorous parts of the vineyard
9365879 palins administration had the appearance of paying absolutely no attention to any of the rest of the unglamorous side of government whether it be dealing with human services public services highways all the routine aspects

9365920 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of the president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9365921 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that and is done in a serious way
9365922 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back

9366038 if russian prime minister vladimir putin does not rethink this then we must find ways to isolate russia internationally
9366039 serbian president slobodan milosevic and his henchmen ordered the ethnic cleansing of serbia and kosovo
9366040 we attempted in several un resolutions to find a solution to the crisis and tried repeatedly to work together with the russians the situation was simply different and what milosevic did is not comparable with what the georgians have done to hold their country together

9366048 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
9366049 human life from the moment of conception is to always be respected treated with dignity and protected
9366050 catholics who support so called abortion rights support a false right promote a culture of death
9366051 out of respect for the teaching of jesus christ and the church

9366061 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9366062 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9366063 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9366064 sen mccain had so many other options if he wanted to put a woman on his ticket such as sen kay bailey hutchison or sen olympia snowe they would have been an appropriate choice compared to

9366075 wow where did you get this from meaning he thought it was a printed one
9366076 i dont think so i think its about getting in touch with reality about balancing aspirations and actuality
9366077 since the second world war and the beginning of the atomic age the consciousness of the creative writer however detached has been confronted with the specter of the totalitarian state the growing poverty and helplessness of western europe and the threat of an inconceivably destructive war which may annihilate civilization and mankind itself clearly when the future of civilization is no longer assured a criticism if american life in terms of a contrast between avowed ideals and present actuality cannot be a primary preoccupation and source of inspiration for america not europe is now the sanctuary of culture civilizations very existence depends upon america upon the actuality of american life and not the ideals of the american dream to criticize the actuality upon which all hope depends thus becomes a criticism of hope itself
9366078 ive got nothing to do and im doing it tomorrow
9366079 obviously if you are reading this then i have died in iraq i kind of predicted this that is why im writing this in november a third time just seemed like im pushing my chances i dont regret going everybody dies but few get to do it for something as important as freedom it may seem confusing why we are in iraq its not to me im here helping these people so that they can live the way we live not have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators to do what they want with their lives to me that is why i died others have died for my freedom now this is my mark
9366080 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
9366081 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
9366082 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
9366083 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
9366084 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
9366085 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
9366086 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
9366087 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
9366088 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
9366089 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
9366090 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
9366091 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
9366092 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face

9366233 een groep iraans nederlandse studenten en wetenschappers tekent protest aan tegen het recente besluit van minister verhagen om iraanse studenten uit te sluiten van bepaalde studierichtingen
9366234 deze maatregel is totaal niet effectief verschillende experts hebben herhaaldelijk verklaard dat in de curricula van masteropleidingen aan de nederlandse universiteiten geen profileratiegevoelige kennis wordt onderwezen de minister kan beter een hek om de gevoelige informatie heen zetten dan om een bevolkingsgroep deze maatregel is buiten alle proporties
9366235 ongelijke behandeling louter op grond van nationaliteit is onacceptabel uitsluiting van irani rs schept een precedent en is een ernstige inbreuk op de individuele vrijheid van burgers en hun fundamentele rechten gezien de eerdere paniekreacties bij universiteit twente en tu eindhoven zijn we bezorgd over de consequenties en de mogelijke willekeur

9366272 what employers want is people with the skills to think and write and speak but the parents dont want to hear that
9366273 if we want to stay alive its like walking on a tightrope you dont become a technical college and totally focus on the professional side but you combine both sides and do it well and turn out liberally educated professionals
9366274 what weve really done is sort of highlighted those career paths that follow from a liberal arts education
9366275 i think people see a preprofessional focus as diminishing what a pure liberal arts environment can do
9366276 but our institutions see it as enriching what a liberal arts education can be about if youre an engineer you need to be as critical a thinker as a math major
9366277 but parents are convinced that they dont guarantee johnny and sally a job at graduation so theyre hedging their bets and majoring in economics
9366278 i chose to go to middlebury because i was going to be insulated because it was going to be a place where i could learn and think and not have to learn about real world applications
9366279 it is very much a conscious decision on our part i think because of our deep seeded belief that the liberal arts is the best preparation for life and career
9366280 feel that we didnt do a good enough job for them in the past and they would like to see us do a better job for present students increasingly i think parents are asking the question as well
9366281 we are feeling both pressure and a greater sense of responsibility to do what we can in other ways to help prepare our students for life after st johns

9366315 as the father has loved me so i have loved you now remain in my love
9366316 have you never read from religion and philosophy the lips of children and infants ou have ordained praise
9366317 if i sold my house and my car had a big garage sale and gave all my money to the church would that get me into heaven
9366318 if i cleaned the church every day mowed the yard and kept everything neat and tidy would that get me into heaven
9366319 well then if i was kind to animals and gave candy to all the children and loved my husband would that get me into heaven
9366320 promise of a land where all men are free and equal
9366321 there are those who say to you we are rushing this issue of civil rights i say we are 172 years late
9366322 the time has arrived for the democratic party to get out of the shadow of states rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights

9366329 hay que pedir a apolo versos al amor conceptos sobre todo conceptos al amor
9366330 detr s de un docto notable encontramos no pocas veces a un hombre me
9366331 hay una medida en las cosas que es la que el artista debe encontrar
9366332 toda obra de arte es la satisfacci n de un deseo la conquista de un mundo pleno de sentido perfectamente concebible
9366333 la poes a es un modo de reconocimiento o dicho con otras palabras que lo dicho por la poes a es verdad
9366334 ogni tanto penso che bisognerebbe lasciar andare tutto come deve andare
9366335 musically and career wise we never really had any goals or plans
9366336 were just a band that plays practices writes all the time we just go along and it seems to work out we still love what were doing and are pretty much free from whatever industry cycle youre beholden to when you work for a big company zoe records just puts out our albums when were done with em we were very fortunate to build on that original audience of hard core fans people still wanna hear us
9366337 that was great touring with townes we were just in awe strange thing though usually its common practice for an opening act to travel separately from the headliners thats just the way its done but when townes agreed to open for us he insisted that he ride in our bus i mean insisted we didnt mind at all but we never could figure out why he was so determined to ride with us
9366338 was townes brought his dice along and got us all into gambling wed never done anything like that before you know nice innocent canadian kids and all but he took thousands of dollars off us i mean thousands we couldnt get enough though he got us all addicted to craps later the band went to vegas and got in way over our heads
9366339 i dont know if its a regional thing or just townes but ill never forget he had little nicknames for all the numbers on the dice when he was rollin like six was sister hicks and eight was skater or the donator it was like his own little version of cockney rhyming slang you know
9366340 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9366341 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9366342 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9366343 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9366344 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9366345 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9366346 i had a lot of good people to choose from
9366347 i have found the right partner i found someone who has accomplished reform who has accomplished and managed a multibillion dollar budget and fought against corruption and the failed politics of the past
9366348 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy thing
9366349 its like that old adage a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built politics isnt just a game of clashing parties and competing interests the people of america expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reason
9366350 obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9366351 its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda
9366352 yeah a little sleep but were not going to get much sleep
9366353 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9366354 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9366355 and look he is just talking like a normal conversation with his wife while hes sitting there eating and drinking coffee he stuffed his mouth with eggs i love him hes my kind of guy
9366356 i had a lot of good people to choose from
9366357 i have found the right partner i found someone who has accomplished reform who has accomplished and managed a multibillion dollar budget and fought against corruption and the failed politics of the past
9366358 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy thing
9366359 its like that old adage a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built politics isnt just a game of clashing parties and competing interests the people of america expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reason
9366360 obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9366361 its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda
9366362 yeah a little sleep but were not going to get much sleep
9366363 si dice che fosse il 1916 sul fronte della carnia si fronteggiavano gli austriaci e due reggimenti formati da siciliani si sparavano e si ammazzavano una sera splendendo la luna uno dei nostri un soldato siciliano prese la sua chitarra e cant e mentre cantava gli spari cessarono e quando fin di cantare gli austriaci applaudirono questa canzone cant il soldato non era quello il suo posto in mezzo alla morte e lui invoc il suo posto
9366364 i think a lot of fun things can be done with that name
9366365 have the courage to disconnect yourself from your material things you cannot protect yourself against what mother nature is going to throw at us
9366366 we are going to see storm surge on the west bank like we have never seen before
9366367 im all american but my family history is palestinian so we are used to evacuating
9366368 new orleans evacuated 10 000 people saturday and the estimate is 30 000 people needed to leave
9366369 the challenge seems to be that people arent listening or they are listening and deciding to stay all the coastal parishes are in very significant harms way while you can it is critical to move
9366370 if people are scared they should be scared this is not a drill we just need you to move now
9366371 an extremely dangerous storm surge of 18 to 25 feet more than six meters above normal tidal levels is expected near and to the east of where the center of gustav crosses the northern gulf coast
9366372 if one major deep water production platform is destroyed youre talking about a billion dollar or more loss
9366373 if its multiple rigs and platforms in a variety of water depths then were talking billions of dollars
9366374 have pacquiao on the end of that long jab and will be looking to drop the right hand on him at every opportunity
9366375 pacquiao will want to dictate terms apply pressure from the center of the ring keep the tempo high
9366376 if de la hoya is weight drained the body will be a big target for pacquiao to take away his opponents strength and resolve
9366377 at 35 de la hoya is a tarnished version of his younger self and since the feather fisted forbes cracked his cheekbone imagine what will pacquiao do
9366378 ive come from winning programs and i hope to bring it here with rain or shine i just want to improve personally so i could also help the rest of the team
9366379 i wanted a younger and competitive team and we have achieved that
9366380 the associated work program is underway with field activities scheduled for next week and subject to suitable weather conditions first oil is expected mid september
9366381 god has made me laugh and all who hear will laugh with me
9366382 weve just launched our new mobile website now you can browse buy install and start reading right away
9366383 samy is telling us that india has insufficient food because he showed us a chicken and a goat and he wants malaysia to donate bags of rice
9366384 i dont know what was going on with the scorecards
9366385 is boxing really that low it is sad and turns boxing to the negative side
9366386 ruiz knocked valuev down in the second round and it didnt count and that could have changed the outcome
9366387 i dont know what happened with the japanese judge but we will take his words we will sit back watch the tape and make some decisions
9366388 it seems like every time i come here for business i get the bad end of the situation
9366389 i did not do what i wanted to do 100 per cent
9366390 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9366391 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9366392 its a goal but i want to win a grand slam
9366393 i just got a bit more defensive i felt a little bit tired she took advantage of that
9366394 once gustav makes landfall it will slow down and pose a significant rainfall and flooding threat to louisiana and texas
9366395 on the current path tropical storm force winds are expected to begin impacting the breaux bridge lafayette and crowley areas before noon on monday
9366396 you still have hours to evacuate from the coastal regions
9366397 a lot of fans came to visit and immortalized themselves in graffiti drawings and text much to the distress of the community
9366398 but if we push it to the limits and uptitrate the doses too much then we may cause some harm in the elderly patients at least those who are fragile with a lot of comorbidities
9366399 there is a difference in treatment response between those being represented in the large trials and those not being represented in the large trials and i think this is something that we should be looking at in the future
9366400 the evidence in the guidelines we have is based probably on about 15 to 20 of the population that we actually treat
9366401 the sample size for this trial was based on the entire population for detecting a difference between nt probnp guided and standard therapy
9366402 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9366403 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9366404 chris is a tough guy i hope its not serious you hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground
9366405 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9366406 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9366407 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9366408 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9366409 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9366410 chris told me to just make sure to hold onto the ball
9366411 it would have been different in the olympics if i had run like this
9366412 but the past is the past and this is the present
9366413 i am very frustrated and disappointed with what happened in beijing
9366414 it was so frustrating having to watch rather than perform
9366415 i know i would have been the man to put pressure on bolt but thats what ive got to work towards now but i look forward to meeting usain and finishing my season strongly
9366416 its a bit difficult to come down off the high of the olympics and im still feeling a little tired
9366417 id have loved to have won but it just wasnt to be today
9366418 we all wanted to win the olympics but to beat the medalists here was nice
9366419 i had problems with my achilles tendon so this makes up for that now im looking forward to the rest of the season
9366420 desde luego me parece bastante peculiar que el ministro de transporte se re na con el presidente del tribunal constitucional pero en fin aqu funcion la internacional socialista porque razones para que el bid financiara el transantiago no hab a absolutamente ninguna
9366421 la alianza le hizo ver al gobierno que en lugar de recurrir a subterfugios se hubiera justificado la necesidad de los fondos porque creo que estamos todos de acuerdo que si hay alg n elemento de control que tiene el sistema parlamentario chileno asignar los fondos que gasta el ejecutivo
9366422 aqu lo que hay es un rechazo por parte de la derecha ya lo hubo el a o pasado en la discusi n del presupuesto en que se negaron los recursos para el transantiago y eso es lo que obliga al gobierno a actuar dentro d e sus facultades administrativa
9366423 some days you might have two or three players under performing i cant think of one player today who performed to the level we know they can
9366424 in the premier league you lose games sometimes if two or three are under performing never mind all of them so 3 0 was always going to happen if we were not quite at the races
9366425 i dont think its a day for excuses it really isnt they seemed sharper than us they seemed quicker to the ball than us they passed it better than us they defended better than us they attacked better than us
9366426 they did everything better than us in the game today and when that happens you are never going to win a game of football never
9366427 what we have to try to learn as a team even on our off days is trying to grind a result out whatever it may be
9366428 but we are obviously not capable of doing that just yet
9366429 isnt that what little kids are for is to feed to hungry dogs
9366430 and the idea of working on a framework a framework of principles that is good for us that is good for the palestinians that is good for everyone
9366431 you need to decide on the parameters of how these issues are solved how jerusalem is solved how refugees is solved how water is solved once and for all
9366432 i struggled a little with my technique but oliver pushed me to a nice race
9366433 it was nice to see that i could win again
9366434 the result wasnt important tonight only the victory was im glad im still in the running for the jackpot
9366435 my favorite moment in todays race was coming back through disneys california adventure and seeing mrs incredible and sully cheering us on
9366436 i had to make my way through all the other runners
9366437 but it was a great race with so many people out there cheering us on that really made it special
9366438 when tadesse took off fast i ran hard to close the gap
9366439 the weather made the race more difficult but i am happy with the way it turned out
9366440 the womens race was very competitive and it intensified when three runners battled the last mile down the boardwalk
9366441 that type of finish is exactly what you want to see and to have an american runner right there was great for the home crowd
9366442 despite being 41 years old edith has won 3 gold medals at the world cross country championships
9366443 her natural speed was the telling difference in the end however all the runners ran a great race in difficult conditions
9366444 the course was great and the pace was relatively even and nobody really went out very fast
9366445 im preparing to run the new york marathon in november so this gave me a good idea of where i am with my training
9366446 since its introduction back in 2001 virginia beachs half marathon is still unique as the first major tourism driven half marathon in the world
9366447 the rock n roll half marathon is thrilled to collaborate with runners overseas again this year
9366448 to have this years rock n roll simultaneously in virginia beach and iraq represents the strong ties this community has with the military and we are honored to have an opportunity to be a part of that bond
9366449 we are proud to be a part of what has already become a strong tradition of military support in the virginia beach rock n roll half marathon
9366450 we didnt have the beach or 20 live music bands but we certainly had all of the spirit
9366451 were totally going to be the best married couple ever because my father in law said i was special
9366452 dude im gonna vote and the electoral college better fucking choose obama
9366453 the problem is that real madrid did not manage to recruit
9366454 personen hittade en v ska full med pengar p gatan f r n gra r sen personen beh ll pengarna och spenderade dem p kokain kajsa
9366455 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
9366456 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
9366457 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
9366458 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
9366459 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
9366460 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
9366461 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
9366462 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
9366463 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
9366464 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
9366465 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
9366466 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
9366467 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
9366468 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
9366469 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
9366470 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
9366471 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
9366472 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
9366473 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
9366474 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
9366475 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
9366476 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
9366477 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
9366478 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
9366479 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
9366480 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
9366481 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
9366482 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
9366483 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
9366484 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
9366485 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
9366486 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
9366487 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
9366488 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
9366489 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
9366490 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
9366491 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
9366492 beside you are rappers you have better ethics than bill oreilly does
9366493 a lot of the conservatives reacting have us pegged as black and theyre talking about how we shouldnt get reparations
9366494 i find it frightening that a song like this can bring out that stereotypical reaction to hip hop
9366495 hi guys this is my second vid about my chemical romance
9366496 as we were leaving new orleans yesterday the lines of cars were already evident on i 10 leaving the city
9366497 and this morning we were told a contra flow was going to be put into place with a mandatory evacuation which is a new term for me basically they close out any of the roads coming into new orleans and all lanes are open exiting new orleans
9366498 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9366499 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9366500 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9366501 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9366502 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9366503 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9366504 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9366505 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9366506 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9366507 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9366508 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9366509 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9366510 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9366511 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9366512 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9366513 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9366514 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9366515 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9366516 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9366517 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9366518 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9366519 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9366520 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9366521 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9366522 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9366523 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9366524 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9366525 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9366526 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9366527 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9366528 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9366529 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9366530 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9366531 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9366532 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9366533 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9366534 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9366535 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9366536 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9366537 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9366538 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9366539 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9366540 people bring their aches and pains to the farmers market
9366541 theoretically we do a 10 minute massage here for 10 but i dont think anybody gets under 20 minutes
9366542 homemade homegrown and hand crafted it has to be produced by the person selling it
9366543 people apply in the spring and a committee samples and evaluates the products
9366544 i like to say hi to people i know and i like to buy food from organic farmers and support the community theres always something different when you come music or activities for the kids
9366545 people know they can bring their kids and stay awhile
9366546 there were only four or five tables here when we started
9366547 to move us into an area weve talked about over the years which is how to draw more lower income people into the market
9366548 we also have two churches that get produce donated at the end of the market day for community dinners
9366549 as i think about all these aspects it makes it clear to me why the markets so well regarded in the community
9366550 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9366551 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9366552 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9366553 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9366554 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9366555 la dura legge del gol fai un gran bel gioco per se non hai difesa gli altri segnano e poi vincono loro stanno chiusi ma alla prima opportunit salgon subito e la buttan dentro a noi
9366556 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9366557 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9366558 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9366559 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9366560 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9366561 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9366562 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9366563 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9366564 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9366565 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9366566 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9366567 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9366568 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9366569 who are open to doing something on the production side
9366570 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9366571 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9366572 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

9366579 financially im kind of scared most of the time because what should happen if my health and my body fail
9366580 we have people who are healthier who are living longer and have more economic reasons to stay in the work force
9366581 on the employer side you have greater demand for experienced older workers that all adds up to longer work lives
9366582 but after i retired before they called me i really didnt have anything to do so when they called i jumped on it
9366583 if theres some project to be done next year when they call ill just go do it
9366584 its always been a good idea but right now it can be an especially good idea
9366585 you really dont want to be pulling more money out of a portfolio thats already down
9366586 to me the ideal would be 70 because you get the biggest benefit possible and all those additional years of employment and it keeps you going mentally and physically too
9366587 i feel blessed with the good health that i have but im a little bit bitter because i dont think i should be scared financially at 68
9366588 i just want you to know that your husband is seeing my wife
9366589 if you love her and you want to make this work then you need to go home and be with her

9366611 i have to have the remote i have to and nobody can tell me where to change it im flipping between games and espns sportscenter trying to get scores and highlights
9366612 im the first guy in here i want to go out there and watch the rest of college football its a great time college football is back and im really excited im going to watch a bunch of games
9366613 ill check the highlights out but im not going to sit down and watch a game
9366614 id rather just play ill watch cartoons or something like that
9366615 ill watch a couple games but my family is coming up so ill probably get away
9366616 there are guys that i grew up with that are playing i have a couple of friends at usc that are playing ball right now a couple of guys at lsu ohio state all over
9366617 marcus gilbert is starting at left guard for florida and major wright is playing safety he returned an interception for a touchdown so ill have to hit those guys up later and congratulate them
9366618 but it doesnt matter who it is i like to watch college football whether its michigan or usc or even if its virginia tech and east carolina
9366619 a lot of guys that i know are playing around the country
9366620 friends from my high school we were watching the florida game and one of my high school teammates duke lemmens was playing defensive end
9366621 when i was younger i would watch it for enjoyment
9366622 but now i see myself looking at defenses and thinking if we were playing against that defense what would we do i try to watch them for enjoyment but it just takes over
9366623 if michigan is playing im definitely going to scout them but if its somebody like florida im just sitting down and watching
9366624 ill watch as a fan but ill watch the linebackers to see if i can take anything from that or do a little bit of film study of an opponent i just try to pick up anything i can because im a student of the game
9366625 you do become analytical at times because thats what you do as a player
9366626 but you try to be a fan and take yourself out of it step outside of that circle and spectate
9366627 being a player and watching michigan youre going to pick up on some little things but you really cant study them until you get in the film room
9366628 theyre on the outside looking in and they have no idea what goes on i sit back take it with a grain of salt and move on
9366629 it can get humorous at times people are going to say what theyre going to say let em be
9366630 the guys in the locker room were talking about it we wish we could play today but we have to wait one more week

9366635 the elixir of eternal youth is now not a utopian dream the discovery opens the door to the possibility that humans could live 125 years and without cancer
9366636 when activating p53 and p16 in mice the incidence of cancer is reduced to practically zero we dont think the mice lived longer because they had less cancer but because these genes also protected against ageing
9366637 the thing that makes this new is that its the first time anyone has succeeded in manipulating the interaction between cancer and aging in a manner that actually succeeds and produces a longer lifespan in mammals than would exist without intervention

9366661 a screw up on the part of our research team
9366662 our supporters our staff get overzealous they start saying things that i would not say
9366663 it is my responsibility to make sure that were setting a clear tone in our campaign
9366664 you lifted each other up you covered for each other
9366665 you made up for each others mistakes you didnt blame each other when things went wrong
9366666 that if people were willing to submerge their egos and just focus on bringing their particular gifts and passion and energy and vision to a common task that great things can be accomplished
9366667 i ask my staff never to hand me paper until two seconds before i need it because i will lose it
9366668 ive got to have somebody around me who is keeping track of that stuff and thats not trivial i need to have good people in place who can make sure that systems run thats what ive always done and thats why we run not only a good campaign but a good u s senate office
9366669 being president is not making sure that schedules are being run properly or the paperwork is being shuffled effectively it involves having a vision for where the country needs to go

9366675 we zien dit toch wel als een soort vakantie de dingen die we hier doen zijn leuke dingen ook de optredens dus daar word je niet moe van
9366676 het is wel een soort vakantie maar we zijn wel de hele dag bezig
9366677 je moet natuurlijk ook een programma maken maar we hebben voornamelijk lol we hebben gisteren gekart we gaan paintballen en heel veel varen natuurlijk ook
9366678 je wordt s ochtends gewekt door een camera en vervolgens word je gevolgd als je zit te ontbijten kijk de opnamen zijn wel spontaan maar er worden wel dingen ondernomen want als je op een strand blijft liggen tien dagen lang kun je geen tien afleveringen maken uiteindelijk ben je wel gewoon vijftien uur per dag aan het draaien
9366679 vooral nu we iets meer privacy hebben dan in de bus gaat het hartstikke goed

9366682 het is zelfs een beetje zo dat onze vriendinnen het niet leuk vinden dat wij het zo leuk hebben met zn allen

9366691 in the gay football championships the british teams have yet again shown themselves to be the best in the world
9366692 its great to see englands gay team bringing home the trophies
9366693 stonewall lions fc have avenged englands national team recent dismal performance against the czech republic
9366694 this championship has bought together gay football teams from across the world encouraging more gay people to get involved in football and through the spending power of visiting teams and spectators benefits the london economy
9366695 it challenges the machismo and homophobia that is often associated with football in many parts of the world
9366696 cohabiting with a sexual partner outside of a marriage which is valid under the constitution and laws of this state
9366697 this is such a heinous law for the children who need loving parents
9366698 we want to make sure that every i is dotted and t is crossed because this would be such a bad thing for children that we just cant leave any stone unturned
9366699 we need to be looking at ways to increase the number of foster homes and adoptive homes and not discriminate on sexual orientation or marital status
9366700 the need as is the consensus among other state child welfare agencies and the child welfare league of america that the division of children and family services arkansas department of human services should have the responsibility and flexibility to decide which foster and adoptive homes are most appropriate for each childs placement on a case by case basis
9366701 were going to work very hard to defeat this because it is just bad policy for children
9366702 there is no correlation between the health welfare and safety of foster children and the blanket exclusion of any individual who is a homosexual or who resides in a household with a homosexual
9366703 not to promote the health safety and welfare of foster children but rather was based upon the boards views of morality and its bias against homosexuals
9366704 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
9366705 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible
9366706 general feeling amongst the businesses and a vast number of attendees is that we no longer have a manchester pride that is an annual celebration of the lgbt community and the gay village
9366707 lets make no mistake that manchester pride is a hugely successful event and long may that continue but maybe its time to stop trying to turn it into a reading festival the v festival or a mini glastonbury
9366708 many of the businesses in the village have already told us how happy they are with this years event we consult with the village business association early in the planning process and we look forward to continuing that healthy dialogue
9366709 my concern is that the corporate face of it all has taken over at the expense of the gay people and organisations it was created to celebrate
9366710 the youth group are up in arms apparently gay businesses sidelined people were refused entry to the vigil to mourn and celebrate the memories of their lost and loved ones because they hadnt paid 18
9366711 to exclude people from the vigil because they have not paid for a wristband should not be acceptable to anyone and whether deliberate or not there is an assumption by many people that they are excluded from their vigil their opportunity to remember and celebrate the lives of their friends lovers family members and others in the community
9366712 hiv is not owned by any one individual or organisation why is the hiv vigil no longer the hiv vigil

9366718 hitler is doing much for germany his unification of the germans his destruction of communism his training of the young his creation of a spartan state animated by patriotism his curbing of parliamentary government so unsuited to the german character his protection of the right of private property are all good and after all what the germans do in their own territory is their own business except for one thing the persecution and practical expulsion of the jews

9366720 we need to stop creating buzzwords such as elearning and eteaching as they are no longer relevant in our schools computers and technology have been around long enough we need to move beyond this speciality paradigm and move into powerful learning and teaching i see a real danger in the titles such as elearning integrator and epotential whilst we still continue to view ourselves as a speciality with specific skills we will never have integration into our classrooms where it is needed to benefit students i was one of these people butting my head against the wall two years ago trying to understand why people did not integrate technology i had to change my tact and look at it from a student perspective i ran student roundtables and asked them what they would like in regards to powerful learning i never mentioned eteaching or elearning and our students wrote about how they learn best they wrote about the use of images multimedia web and how they can get answers but do not know how to distill or make sense of this information overload there was also a huge push for content creation instead of passive dictation and exercises these students never mentioned that they wanted more elearning in their classrooms and the teachers couldnt help but rub it in when it wasnt mentioned

9366734 its been a tough rally for us but fourth place is good after this weekend what an incredible finish the whaanga stage was like a scrap yard today the car felt the best it has this weekend so we are definitely making steps in the right direction but its taking a little time
9366735 of course we are here for winning though so we have some more steps to take but we have to lift our heads now and keep working so we can start to fight at the front
9366736 rally new zealand last year produced the closest wrc finish in recent years and this year we have seen yet again an incredible twist on the final day
9366737 basically we took the decision to put one lap on the race tyre in warm up this morning to get it scrubbed in weve done it before and not had a problem but today i could feel from the first lap that the grip wasnt right
9366738 after a few laps it started to feel better and i was gaining confidence but it let go
9366739 its a real shame but anyway we tried hard here and once again i think weve shown we are very fast we have a great bike and tyres that work fantastically this gives me confidence for next year and im looking forward to it already
9366740 today is a truly fantastic day and i cant believe that i have matched agostinis record
9366741 he was one of my heroes so its quite incredible to have made it to 68 wins
9366742 mugello has always been my track even though its further away from tavullia but here after the bad time last year when he suffered an engine failure on lap five we havent found it so easy
9366743 i got a good start but then dani came past me very fast and i then lost a lot of time getting past him and had to take some big risks i had a big slide
9366744 once i was past him i could see casey although i have to admit that today i wasnt as confident as i was in brno that i could win
9366745 were not looking to call an evacuation and havent issued a state of emergency
9366746 its not going to come this way and were on the dry side anyway we may experience tropical force winds by tuesday
9366747 but as it moves into a less favorable environment in the north central gulf of mexico where the water temperatures are cooler it could encounter wind shear
9366748 we could get some rain bands out of it and theres the possibility of tropical force winds depending on where it is
9366749 we got everybodys telephone number and would call with instructions
9366750 we have 600 in texas city and about 1 100 or 1 200 on the mainland and several thousand in galveston
9366751 during rita we sent out everybody on school buses with no restrooms
9366752 it wasnt that comfortable and they traveled a long distance but it worked and would have saved lives
9366753 it remains likely that gustav will prove to be a worst case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage
9366754 the industry is much more prepared and taking things much more seriously thats why so much has been shut down so quickly

9366765 some people stealing is part of their culture and part of their life
9366766 to them its a 24 hour a day job if they want it bad enough theyre going to get it you have to remain vigilant against that
9366767 we are pleased to have reached the upper end of our revenue guidance in spite of the challenging macroeconomic environment

9366771 expanding our technical sales relations with our sales team reaching our customers directly as well as enhancing our relationships with our broad base of customers

9366786 theyve said we need to mop up all the slippery suds
9366787 weve always stressed that people need to bring their own bedding
9366788 in a situation like a hurricane theres not time to bring hundreds of thousands of cots into one location
9366789 we will use it primarily for catastrophic storms as a way to safely evacuate in phases to get the galveston county population ahead of the regional population
9366790 at least we know weve got something and thats better than nothing when it comes to an orderly evacuation of the region
9366791 if some decide they cant live without air conditioning and theyre not in the danger zone and dont want to take a chance we have no control over that
9366792 people were more nervous than they had ever been for a hurricane when they saw the same storm on the same track over the course of five days anxiety levels were very high
9366793 money is power you ought to be reasonably ambitious to have it
9366794 kids even when theyre sick are resilient theyre upbeat and hopeful and we wanted to give them that kind of environment
9366795 hopefully news coverage will be heavy and tell people when the roads are clear or when grocery stores are open
9366796 who knows the university of texas medical branch or mainland medical center might not be fully operational you have to gauge what there is to come back to like a worst case scenario but i certainly hope we dont see that
9366797 theres not much good in coming back in town if there is no electricity or no grocery stores to provide food after the storm makes landfall well determine how quickly to allow people back in
9366798 i have an issue with you my boyfriend knows what an earthquake is and everyone has been laughing at him and hes upset and then you take the p out of my dad by saying hes thick and hes not hes like seriously clever
9366799 thats when i felt a hard slap to my right cheekbone i put my hand to my face while my friends looked on aghast

9366801 if she does not stop bad mouthing her she will have me to contend with
9366802 the staff will continue to monitor the hurricane as it makes its direct track
9366803 we may be experiencing winds on tuesday but we dont even have voluntary evacuations called on the west end for tides
9366804 with the hurricane predicted to stall in east texas there could be significant rain events
9366805 they need to get home and not get caught in rain events
9366806 i was looking at the parking and getting a feel for what the needs are for the court water district and library
9366807 were over the contingency and i dont know where the funding will come from beyond that
9366808 maybe it will come out of savings down the road or from general revenue
9366809 the decisions to use the moneys to supplement the city hall project occurred despite the repeated forecast of a softening economy
9366810 were on schedule with the structural steel foundation and metal deck
9366811 the city is doing site improvements paving parking lots and drives
9366812 for a number of us what we are calling anarchist studies no longer necessarily takes anarchism as its object of study but as a standpoint from which to study the world anarchist contributions to thought are making a reappearance in a number of fields challenging established orthodoxies perhaps against all odds we are witnessing the emergence of a new anarchist paradigm in academia
9366813 that critical grey area between independent anarchist scholarship and the academy
9366814 what we are doing when we research the history of anarchism and anarchists some recent scholarship appears to suggest that the lives of anarchists their hopes fears contradictions and yes moments of inspiration are no more than objects for intellectual experimentation
9366815 although this is a study primarily at the level of ideology and organization i have endeavored to avoid producing a history dealing solely with leaders or faceless organizations
9366816 increased distance both in terms of ideology and practice between anarchist communism and individualist anarchism

9366822 i hope to be able to get to louisiana as soon as conditions permit
9366823 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9366824 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9366825 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that and is done in a serious way
9366826 were going to have a convention we have to endorse a candidate but it may be a different convention than what we thought of a couple days ago
9366827 keep in mind those areas are under a mandatory evacuation so right now they couldnt go home anyway

9366851 we condemn the deployment of a massive police force and other state machinery to kuruman to keep the faction fighting within the anc under control
9366852 we also express our dismay over the alleged use of state property at the conference the land affairs and agriculture mec apparently instructed officials to move her office furniture to kuruman for networking purposes

9366866 but theyre also the same people who said they shouldnt have done that afterwards because he really was the son of god
9366867 we can never truly understand what jesus went through or compare our suffering to his i feel the coach has crossed the line this time
9366868 in his position needs the support of the country but as national coach he needs to expect criticism when his team is not performing well
9366869 de villiers seems focused on proving everyone wrong he is definitely crossing the line
9366870 it may be intimidating when you see your teens wildly pressing keys on their cell phones to send a text message also know as sms or short message service

9366991 we went through political hot water tons of it and not just nationally but internationally
9366992 we will continue to look for options for ketchikan to allow better access to the island
9366993 the concentration is not going to be on a 400 million bridge
9366994 for somebody who touts process and transparency in getting projects done im disappointed and taken aback
9366995 this is contrary to about every statement she has ever made
9366996 we worked 30 years to get funding for this priority project
9366997 the federal government is less and less interested in continuing to fund these projects she said
9366998 it cant be a state priority for dot when we have much needed road and bridge improvements our intention is to work with the community to find a sensible and efficient shuttle connection a better ferry service
9366999 ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport but the 398 million bridge is not the answer
9367000 despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project and its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9367001 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened
9367002 there is no question we desperately need to construct new roads in this state including in southeast alaska where skyrocketing costs for the alaska marine highway system present an impediment to the states budget and the regions economy
9367003 the original purpose of this project was to improve access to gravina island and we will continue to work with the community to help them attain that goal
9367004 the foundation is strictly non partisan and non political and takes no positions on pending legislation ballot measures or other policy proposals
9367005 ca needs more workers with college degrees ca needs more workers with math skills
9367006 all students should be treated the same all students need to be aware of what it takes to get into college students who enter college having taken math beyond alg ii do better in college
9367007 more students are likely to go to college and more likely to be successful once there if they take algebra i in the 8th grade

9367016 i woke up and my email was just going crazy
9367017 and then when it was announced it was like you couldnt breathe
9367018 its so satisfying as a conservative woman when she walked out on that stage there was just this moment it was really emotional for a lot of us
9367019 i was in the rules committee with about 150 people in the room they had tvs set up and we took a break to watch the announcement for a second after she came out it was silent then there was a gasp and everybody stood up and started cheering and clapping we stayed standing the whole speech
9367020 there were 10 or 12 women party stalwarts in tears using napkins and handkerchiefs
9367021 there is an electricity going through the social conservative crowd right now its unbelievable
9367022 especially given all the set ups and head fakes its amazing a lot of people were sure he was going to show his more moderate colors
9367023 my wife and i watched an msnbc special on her last night
9367024 my wife knew nothing about this woman but she was in tears listening to her articulate the views she had
9367025 dozens of emails and the phones have been ringing off the hook
9367026 they were taunting me saying mccains going to disappoint you
9367027 boy what kind of prayers have you been saying for mccain
9367028 he went and chose a pentecostal for his running mate
9367029 finally we can get 100 behind the republican ticket change we can believe in
9367030 you know ive had my problems with mccain but he has reached out a hand to us both at the nra annual meeting earlier this year and with the amazing selection of sarah palin as his running mate
9367031 while barack obama wants to ban ar 15s palin shoots ar 15s and apparently pretty well
9367032 every shooter every hunter every gun owner every competitor needs to understand that it is time to in the words of bruce willis cowboy the f
9367033 well be able to have some fun contrasting not just mccain and obama but biden and palin
9367034 shes great on our issues and bidens been terrible for 35 years
9367035 palin could play strong in the sporting states like michigan ohio and pennsylvania depending on how they use her
9367036 most pundits will underestimate her appeal in these key areas because they dont know her and they are unfamiliar with the sporting scene but among sportsmen authenticity counts and palins got that and then some
9367037 i can tell you that this pick tells millions in the base of the party that they can trust mccain more specifically that they can trust him with supreme court picks and other key appoitments
9367038 ive talked to two prominent social conservative leaders in the past 24 hours who told me they had previously not planned to attend the convention but were now coming to minneapolis after the palin pick
9367039 one scrambled to find a hotel room and is coming tomorrow the other re arranged his schedule and is flying in wednesday i got a call this afternoon from an evangelical business leader who told me he was contacting the mccain campaign and offering to host a fundraiser with his friends for mccain sans the candidate before the thursday deadline when mccain shifts to the public financing system i dont know if ive ever seen a veep pick energize the grassroots like this
9367040 contrast that to obamas bitter clingers obama just lost blue collar white democratic voters in pennsylvania and other states
9367041 the choice is to shore up the conservative pro drilling base
9367042 this is an aggressive on offense pick not a defensive pick
9367043 he floated the pro abortion running mate then there was his performance at the saddleback debate and then you had the lieberman headfake and now this

9367075 first time ko pa lang siyang makakasama at first time na makaka partner hindi pa talaga kami close natawa nga ako nang pagkatapos ng first take sa kissing scene sabi ni direk joel sa amin hindi ko sinabing magtukaan kayo sabi ko maghalikan kayo na take two kami and after that naging maayos na ang taping ng eksena namin
9367076 umaga na po kasi kami natapos ng taping this morning
9367077 sa monday september 1 na po kasi ang pilot telecast namin after ng vaklushi season ng daisy siete and we need to promote it
9367078 yes po kaya nga medyo kabado ako sa simula ng taping namin pinapanood po sa amin ang original story pero hindi ko po kailangang gayahin ang acting ni ms dawn siyempre po sarili ko po kung paano ko i tackle ang kanyang character dahil siguro po hindi namin kayang lampasan ang husay ng acting nina ate sharon cuneta at gabby concepcion at very supportive po naman si direk joel gagawin ko na lang kung ano ang best ko
9367079 hindi po totoo yon kasi noong nasa abs cbn pa ako ginawa ko ang
9367080 ano po ang dapat kong ireklamo samantalang kahit afternoon slot ang
9367081 at ano pa ang mahihiling mo kung si direk joel lamangan naman ang direktor mo siya rin ang direktor ko sa babangon akot dudurugin kita kaya natuwa ako nang siya muli ang magdidirek nito kaya kahit siguro sa madaling araw ipalalabas ang bago kong soap tatanggapin ko pa rin
9367082 saka may bago akong sisimulang dramedy sa primetime slot ang la lola next month september hindi ko pa lang alam ang exact date magsisimula na po kaming mag taping
9367083 medyo nga po nailang ako kasi first taping day pa lang namin ni wendell kissing scene na agad
9367084 first time ko pa lang siyang makakasama at first time na makaka partner hindi pa talaga kami close
9367085 sa ngayon kasi wala pa kaming chance ni wendell na mag bonding dahil after that wala pa kami ulit taping na magkasama mas madalas kong kasama sa eksena sina mel at tita gina si maxene hindi ko pa rin nakakasama sa taping ang madalas niya pang kasama ngayon si wendell sa mga taping nila sa morong bataan ako naman dito lang sa metro manila at saka sa subic
9367086 hindi po siya nagseselos hindi ko na rin dapat sabihin sa kanya kung ano ang gagawin ko given na po kasi na bilang artista kasama ang mga ganoong eksena sa shooting o taping naiintindihan po niya ang trabaho ko
9367087 sila na lang po ang uuwi at magbabakasyon dito ang buong family sa side ng mommy ko gusto po nilang magbakasyon sa boracay at sa january 2009 po sila uuwi rito
9367088 care about you worrying you dont let me worry me
9367089 oh poor child my dear poor one you cant do anything anything at all also nobody on earth can love you poor poor one
9367090 just as reality can blithely exhibit the most absurt coiincidences that no credible fiction could convince us of so only reality produced ultimately by matter can be so unthinkingly cruel
9367091 you can have hot showers and cold beer you have no water bill no sewer bill and no power bill why would you ever do anything else
9367092 i like being my own power company i wouldnt take their electricity if they brought it to my back door
9367093 at the moment there is a lot of interest from spurs its not resolved in one way or the other at the moment
9367094 those things need to be resolved and come to a conclusion at the end of the day we are still trying to build the club trying to bring good players to the club who will make us better
9367095 i need an update in fairness i need to speak to people in and around the club things may well have happened today if it doesnt happen it doesnt happen
9367096 he feels that he can still do a good job in the premier league
9367097 ive been asking since february to trade me to let me go
9367098 ive done my piece ive done my time ive done everything i can for this organization ive lived and breathed steeler football for nine years and gave them everything ive had and helped them win a super bowl in my mind ive earned the right to be treated fairly
9367099 to make me go out there this year and play football with no security just to go out there and play football for what ive done for this organization in my mind its not right
9367100 tony will serve as a tremendous asset in both the running and passing game as well as on special teams
9367101 with nearly 200 games of nfl experience he is a consummate professional who will serve as a great resource for our younger players
9367102 we have accomplished some of our goals over the past two seasons but there remains much left to be done
9367103 i am excited by the opportunity to meet those challenges and someday return another lombardi trophy home to green bay
9367104 mike brings tremendous passion work ethic and structure to his position
9367105 these are the traits we saw in him when he was hired and were very happy for the success we have had under his guidance
9367106 i think its great to have five years to continue to reach our goal
9367107 its only natural to say my goodness that should have been us
9367108 theyre a perfect example of playing their best football when it counts
9367109 thats something i did not desire at this point i think structure lines of responsibilities organization charts are very important to any successful operation
9367110 i think the fit between ted thompson and myself and the way were structured with our personnel department and coaching staff the way they work hand in hand i think its an extremely healthy situation
9367111 corey is a good young football player and has been a consistent performer for our team
9367112 i dont think it has anything to do with anything hes retired period point blank
9367113 in the middle of a large crowd throwing punches and again yelling obscenities
9367114 we are aware of the situation with bryant mckinnie we will respond further once we have collected the appropriate information
9367115 coming into this league to stay in this league one of the things they tell you when youre not a big time draft pick is youve got to be good on special teams
9367116 thats one of the biggest keys for me is special teams
9367117 thats how ive survived in this league off special teams
9367118 linebackers like myself dream about playing with guys like them two great defensive linemen right in front of you
9367119 romantic though it may sound phlebotomy in the back seat by the dashboard lights is in this humble trial judges opinion unconstitutional
9367120 now every dps blood draw can be subject to challenge on the same basis
9367121 what likely could happen is that prosecutors may have to dismiss a lot of cases that are pending
9367122 it could have ripples statewide until it gets sorted out until they improve the program or get the court of appeals to say fields ruling is wrong
9367123 carried out in roadside situations with poor lighting and in less than sanitary conditions
9367124 the goal of obtaining evidence cannot be allowed to wholly trump the goals of medical safety and human dignity if the intrusion is to pass fourth amendment muster
9367125 hes a big tall left sided defender who will bring physical attributes to our team due to his sheer size
9367126 jonas is comfortable on the ball can pick a pass and also has a real winners attitude
9367127 hes been brought in to increase competition at centre half and im looking forward to working with him and helping to develop his career in the premier league

9367302 stanley played very well it was a close decision we went with hilee because we think he will continue to improve
9367303 they both have pass rush abilities hilee is probably a little bit more raw but he continued to improve in training camp and had a pretty good preseason so we made the decision to keep him over stanley
9367304 we think that mackenzy is going to be a very good player
9367305 he improved the entire training camp we thought he played well the last preseason game against the steelers hes a guy who has good size and good movement we thought that he earned a spot
9367306 it was a difficult decision to left milford brown because came in and he did everything that was asked him and played well but we could only keep so many numbers there and it ended up we kept nine linemen and had to let milford go and that was a very hard decision

9367314 tutta lestate lon enrico letta ha sostenuto pi volte limportanza di un dialogo aperto con ludc per una possibile alleanza in futuro sostenendo che tale opportunit sia lunica che permetta al suo partito di poter tornare a governare il paese
9367315 legittime aspirazioni ed analisi politica ineccepibile dal suo punto di vista tenendo anche conto della sua provenienza e della sua storia personale che chiaramente lo rende molto pi propenso a guardare al centro piuttosto che verso la sinistra radicale la quale per gli ha permesso per ben due volte di essere un autorevole esponente del governo prosegue comunque le sue lusinghe possono essere apprezzabili anche se relativamente interessanti abbastanza sconcertante invece quando lo si sente denigrare la classe dirigente delludc toscano alla festa del suo partito a modena
9367316 le sue affermazioni sono chiare e precise ha addirittura utilizzato un aggettivo che ci risparmiamo di ripetere che non lascia spazio a fraintendimenti

9367347 in queste ultime settimane ha detto ratzinger al termine della recita dell angelus dal palazzo apostolico di castel gandolfo la cronaca ha registrato laumento degli episodi di immigrazione irregolare dallafrica
9367348 non di rado la traversata del mediterraneo verso il continente europeo visto come un approdo di speranza per sfuggire a situazioni avverse e spesso insostenibili si trasforma in tragedia quella avvenuta qualche giorno ha aggiunto il papa ricordando i recenti casi di sbarco di clandestini che hanno prodotto numerosi morti fa sembra aver superato le precedenti per lalto numero di vittime la migrazione fenomeno presente fin dagli albori della storia dellumanit che da sempre pertanto ha caratterizzato le relazioni tra popoli e nazioni
9367349 lemergenza in cui si trasformata nei nostri tempi tuttavia ci interpella e mentre sollecita la nostra solidariet impone nello stesso tempo efficaci risposte politiche so che molte istanze regionali nazionali e internazionali si stanno occupando della questione della migrazione irregolare ad esse va il mio plauso e il mio incoraggiamento affinch continuino la loro meritevole azione con senso di responsabilit e spirito umanitario
9367350 senso di responsabilit devono mostrare anche i paesi di origine non solo perch si tratta di loro concittadini ha aggiunto benedetto xvi ma anche per rimuovere le cause di migrazione irregolare come pure per stroncare alle radici tutte le forme di criminalit ad essa collegate dal canto loro i paesi europei e comunque quelli meta di immigrazione sono tra laltro chiamati a sviluppare di comune accordo iniziative e strutture sempre pi adeguate alle necessit dei migranti irregolari questi ultimi poi vanno pure sensibilizzati sul valore della propria vita che rappresenta un bene unico sempre prezioso da tutelare di fronte ai gravissimi rischi a cui si espongono nella ricerca di un miglioramento delle loro condizioni e sul dovere della legalit che si impone a tutti
9367351 come padre comune sento il profondo dovere di richiamare lattenzione di tutti sul problema e di chiedere la generosa collaborazione di singoli e di istituzioni per affrontarlo e trovare vie di soluzione il signore ha concluso benedetto xvi ci accompagni e renda fecondi i nostri sforzi

9367364 apprezzabili le sue lusinghe ma sconcertante le sue denigrazioni della classe dirigente delludc toscano
9367365 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9367366 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9367367 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9367368 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9367369 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9367370 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9367371 apprezzabili le sue lusinghe ma sconcertante le sue denigrazioni della classe dirigente delludc toscano
9367372 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9367373 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9367374 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9367375 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9367376 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9367377 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9367378 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9367379 apprezzabili le sue lusinghe ma sconcertante le sue denigrazioni della classe dirigente delludc toscano
9367380 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9367381 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9367382 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9367383 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9367384 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9367385 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9367386 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9367493 medford has been our rival for years but now that we have their coach its a big challenge
9367494 we have a really strong core of returning players which should help with the transition of a new coach
9367495 but its a very young team a lot of sophomores and juniors
9367496 its not a system where one or two players score the majority of the goals
9367497 and its the same on defense there will be 11 players on the field attacking the goal its not going to be one persons responsibility to mark one person

9367499 ive been running every morning keeping my mind focused and trying to do everything i can for my team

9367501 we cant think that high because this is the first year were focusing on starting the program even though winning is important we want to get a program fixed so next year can be even better and the year beyond
9367502 our first goal is to make the tournament our second is to win the gbl championship but i shoot for the stars so were going to look for the state championship

9367590 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
9367591 la verdad est de nuestra parte nos movemos en el marco del derecho internacional
9367592 las emociones se alteran pero nosotros no vemos ning n paso pr ctico que conduzca a un enfriamiento
9367593 ni mucho menos quieren todos los pa ses de la ue castigar a rusia por una supuesta agresi n contra georgia
9367594 maybe if people knew what was going on in here theyd make a move
9367595 albus severus mormor in modo che nessuno sentisse a parte ginny e lei con molto tatto finse di salutare rose gi sul treno tu porti il nome di due presidi di hogwarts uno di loro era un serpeverde e probabilmente luomo pi coraggioso che io abbia mai conosciuto
9367596 bella arriverei ad odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male
9367597 certo certo e ci che vuoi che io pensi e quando mi sveglie sar molto peggio se mi sveglier il che non avverr perch sono gi morta
9367598 capisco che tu possa avermi scambiato per un incubo ma non riesco a immaginare cosa potresti aver fatto di tanto brutto per finire allinferno ne hai ammazzati molti in mia assenza
9367599 i asked you a question do you suck dick simple question
9367600 los saqueadores ir n a parar directamente a la c rcel
9367601 no se pongan en situaciones de peligro ni hagan que los trabajadores de grupos de rescate tomen riesgos innecesarios
9367602 y sepan que el pueblo de estados unidos est con ustedes enfrentaremos la emergencia juntos
9367603 el mensaje al pueblo de la costa del golfo de m xico es el siguiente esta tormenta es peligrosa
9367604 most of us are carrying two three four tourniquets with us in our kit these poor guys didnt have any they had a rifle and there was no way for them to make an expedient tourniquet it just wasnt in their training
9367605 massive injuries like that it doesnt take long for someone to bleed out
9367606 nobody was going to come up with the money we decided to design our own and see if we could get them manufactured in kandahar city
9367607 it covers a lot of bases one it saves lives and two it pumps some money into the local economy
9367608 we wanted to make it very simple pictures work well for these guys because literacy is a huge issue
9367609 we actually put them on the clock and the goal is to get it done in 30 seconds or less to save the limb
9367610 its amazing what a bag of jolly ranchers will do
9367611 theres prizes for the top student of the morning theyre very competitive once you get them spooled up
9367612 its funny they try to emulate us if they see something that we think is cool they think its cool too
9367613 theres a lot of turmoil in their life and we keep switching up mentors
9367614 socialization is a huge part of being a mentor and it takes a couple of months to get into their head space and timing and for them to get into yours
9367615 for evil to conquer good men need only do nothing
9367616 anybody whos caught looting in the city of new orleans will go directly to angola louisiana state penitentiary you will not have a temporary stay in the city you go directly to the big house in general population
9367617 were just not seeing those kind of numbers in terms of people needing city assisted services
9367618 were the volunteer state and were stepping up to the plate
9367619 for evil to conquer good men need only do nothing
9367620 just watching them were jealous that we cant be playing right now i cant wait to hit somebody else i dont care who it is just somebody other than my own teams jersey
9367621 ive been ready to go just waiting to get on the field and perform for everybody
9367622 it gives us a chance to get out there and get the juices out and especially get the freshmen guys ready to feel what a gameday is like and not to go out there and not know what theyre doing
9367623 in pregame warm ups we have a lot going on
9367624 going against the first team defense day in and day out you get that speed of the game and get that confidence going
9367625 it was just a different mentality this year it didnt feel like camp if felt like we had a job to accomplish i think we had a really good camp now its just carrying that into the first game
9367626 i think its getting the speed of the game for both the offense and the defense
9367627 i think thats a huge thing if you dont practice against that youre going to be shell shocked going into the game its going to be a lot faster in the game
9367628 as a whole the offense and defense and even from freshmen to upperclassmen everybody is getting along real well and everybodys sticking together
9367629 as we become more united we have one goal one vision and thats to win guys will put the team before themselves
9367630 when i first heard the news it was one of those things that makes you step back and think what have i done since ive been here for the last three years thats gotten me to this position to have them recognize me as a leader and be able to look to me on special teams as someone that they can turn to and try to lead by example by just playing hard every day and do everything i can to help those guys be successful is something im going to look forward to
9367631 perch non lasciare una dedica nella firma della mia adorata gemel
9367632 grazie per aver incrociato il mio cammino ele amp ann

9367637 desde hace much simos a os no responde a un transporte de calidad
9367638 cuarenta minutos para llegar desde alicante al aeropuerto es mucho tiempo esto sumado a que una de las condiciones de tal concesi n es pasar por torrellano hace todav a mas eterno el trayecto
9367639 los autobuses que realizan este itinerario deber an renovarse el maletero resulta peque o y la indicaci n de las paradas no resulta clara sobre todo para los extranjeros
9367640 deber an establecerse unos m nimos en este servicio sobre todo en verano al ser una poca en que el volumen de pasajeros se incrementa por la temporada tur stica
9367641 desde el grupo socialista hemos propuesto un trayecto directo por la carretera de santa pola desvi ndose en la salida del aeropuerto con paradas estrat gicas en la oami ciudad de la luz estaci n de autobuses renfe mercado central y plaza del mar
9367642 roza el absurdo que no haya una parada en la estaci n de renfe qu ocurre con el pasajero que llega a renfe cargado con sus maletas y para desplazarse al aeropuerto tiene que irse hasta la estaci n de autobuses muchos de ellos no conocen nuestra ciudad y les resulta dif cil moverse
9367643 necesidad de que en los meses de julio y agosto se refuerce este servicio incrementando la frecuencia y estableciendo un servicio directo hasta el aeropuerto
9367644 no puede ser que sabiendo el volumen de pasajeros que tiene nuestro aeropuerto sobre todo en fines de semana como este fin de las vacaciones para muchos no se prevea esta situaci n y el visitante se encuentre con largas esperas e incomodidades es cierto que muchos de ellos no votan pero el turista que viene a alicante debe irse con la convicci n de que los servicios que se ofrecen son de calidad para que nos vuelva a visitar de nuevo
9367645 recientes reivindicaciones de los empresarios y hosteleros castellonenses que reclamaron inversiones para el sector tur stico

9367648 interesarse por algunas de esas obras pendientes como el encauzamiento del barrando de fraga el del barranco de las palmas o la prolongaci n del encauzamiento urbano en viver
9367649 por qu no le exige al consell que las ejecute

9367660 es especialmente importante la labor desarrollada en poca estival en este espacio natural puesto que es el momento en el que se producen las mayores agresiones al entorno con motivo del incremento del turismo
9367661 visitantes a la playa veraneantes familias que hacen incursiones a la pinada adem s de otros desaprensivos ponen en peligro este extraordinario ecosistema natural durante los meses de mayor calor y ello se traduce en la mayor regularidad a la hora de recoger basuras y residuos en colaboraci n con los servicios de limpieza del ayuntamiento de guardamar

9367681 palin said she has smoked marijuana remember it was legal under state law she said even if illegal under u s law but says she didnt like it and doesnt smoke it now
9367682 i cant claim a bill clinton and say that i never inhaled
9367683 governor palin is one of many millions of americans who have used marijuana and gone on to live productive wildly successful lives
9367684 that she used marijuana is no big deal but what is a big deal is that she thinks that the 100 million americans who have used marijuana including herself belong in jail that wouldnt be good for her kids
9367685 perhaps most importantly alaska is one of 12 states that allow the medical use of marijuana and one in five americans currently live in those states the heavy hand of the federal government has trampled state authority and tried to interfere with the implementation of these state level medical marijuana laws the gop ticket should embrace the time honored republican principle of local control by promising to end the federal governments war on sensible medical marijuana laws in both red and blue states

9367692 a screening study in 2002 included an assessment of the types of projects and activities most urgently needed by indigenous peoples
9367693 42 indigenous discussion groups were asked to list the top 5 indigenous priority needs here is the result of the bank commissioned assessment number in brackets indicates number of discussion groups who ranked the particular need among the top 5 priorities
9367694 significant negative socioeconomic impacts were identified only for one type of project road infrastructure a need prioritized by only a minority of groups as follows
9367695 the discussion groups did identify potential negative impacts associated with road projects these potential negative impacts can be listed as follows that some bad and clever outsiders may come after the road is built and exploit the assets of the village that outsiders may come and take their land that the road may lead to their forests being destroyed or degraded by sometimes armed outsiders and it will then be difficult to find forest food and forest products to sell possible land appropriation and deforestation following road construction is a major potential negative socioeconomic impact there are cases where such negative impacts particularly in terms of deforestation have occurred following road construction in forest dependent communities many forest areas have already been degraded in areas with poor road infrastructure however improved roads can accelerate that process and open new areas for exploitation by a larger number of logging interests
9367696 the small scale activities chosen by villagers and funded through rilgp will not affect land tenure or otherwise cause any direct adverse impacts

9367738 by taking responsibility for our own lives we begin to recognise that our happiness isnt contingent upon what others do or dont do
9367739 when we apply our slogan let it begin with me we stop waiting for others to meet our needs and instead look to ourselves this does not mean we have to do it all or that we cant count on anyone rather we learn to stop expecting our needs to be met by someone who is incapable of doing so we can feel disappointed and let down without our whole world falling to pieces

9367747 a week ago the iraqi army surrounded khanaqin this was illogical khanaqin is stable and there is no security breach
9367748 why are they treating the peshmerga like rebels my brother served in baghdad arabs and kurds are all brothers
9367749 the presence of peshmerga in diyala is just like the presence of an outlaw militia

9367792 it is true that that baroness holds an almost supernatural attraction for anna leopoldovna

9367826 ian is a very determined guy i love his attitude and what he did at the open that back nine he played with the intention to win and had that emotional feeling
9367827 ive been watching paul play and he has been playing absolutely the best through the summer he has an extremely good record in the ryder cup and going back the walker cup
9367828 if i was a wildcard then id possible feel like i dont really deserve to be there
9367829 but doing it without winning shows ive played pretty consistent i think it is maybe a bit more impressive
9367830 if friday had gone a little differently it could have been all over this has proved to people like nick faldo and lee westwood who i played with for the first two rounds that i can do it when i really need to

9367880 on average caregivers only slept about six and a half hours a night and took almost 23 minutes to fall asleep
9367881 using the sleep diary data that subjects kept at the same time however depression was the primary determinant of poor sleep with depressed subjects reporting less time asleep and more wake time over the week
9367882 these are missed opportunities for stroke prevention sadly we frequently see patients admitted to a hospital with a devastating stroke who are known to have atrial fibrillation yet were either not taking warfarin or were taking a dose that is not therapeutic we consider these to be potentially preventable strokes
9367883 patients hate taking warfarin and doctors hate prescribing it this is mainly because its a hassle however this study confirms that many strokes can be avoided if patients are adequately anti coagulated therefore both patients and doctors need to do a better job of overcoming the inconvenience of warfarin
9367884 before we conducted these analyses we knew based on evidence from previous studies that we might expect acceleration in decline on cognitive abilities before death
9367885 and our findings clearly showed there to be a pattern of terminal decline even among relatively healthy individuals that the brain changes that influence our cognitive abilities in old age occur over a relatively long period of time even among individuals who remain non demented until they die
9367886 typically when you ask the question how does mental function change with age the older you get its easy to mix up people who are merely old with people who are in fact dying
9367887 and this study illustrates very clearly that there is a certain period before death from so called natural causes where mental function declines at an accelerating pace and while most investigators had thought that this kind of decline begins between three to five years before death this study shows that it in fact can be traced back to a starting point that is a lot earlier than previously thought
9367888 they the fda were concentrating on the more severe forms of the condition but we felt it was important to get this information out there

9367893 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself as has been the case in other situations i would not rule anything out down the road
9367894 i have no regrets about my time thus far with the patriots the immense respect that ive long held for the organization has been only heightened over the past couple of weeks i am going to keep all options open and look forward with excitement to see what the future brings
9367895 in fact i have not received a single answer to a single e mail or letter sent to the minister since he was elected
9367896 under mr campbell we had some serious opposition to japanese outlaw whaling in the southern ocean
9367897 republicans i am listening to are just absolutely ecstatic said jerry buchanan a former tulsa county republican chairman
9367898 they are excited because the republicans are doing something a little different this time
9367899 we got to the point that there were about 20 of us having a celebration
9367900 it shows that our party is not just a bunch of elitists
9367901 she will be a fresh face for many he said adding that palins appearance at the convention will be the first time a number of oklahoma delegates will see her in person
9367902 its clear that sen obamas plans for the future of this country are sketchy and ambiguous at best
9367903 this is our chance for sen mccain to take the stage and outline his plans for prosperity and success for our nation
9367904 that will be a highlight for us holt said of the appearances
9367905 palin is not to be underestimated her real strength is that she is authentic a real mom an outdoors person a small town mayor hey she has dealt with a small town city council that alone could be preparation for staring down vladimir putin right she is also a reformer
9367906 a very important demographic in this election is going to be the politically independent woman 15 of whom in our latest survey are undecided
9367907 in the final analysis this election will be about obama vs
9367908 this contest is likely to be very close until the weekend before the election then the dam may break and support may flood one way or the other
9367909 finally we can get 100 percent behind the republican ticket
9367910 you know ive had my problems with mccain but he has reached out a hand to us both at the nra annual meeting earlier this year and with the amazing selection of sarah palin as his running mate
9367911 while barack obama wants to ban ar 15s palin shoots ar 15s and apparently pretty well
9367912 well be able to have some fun contrasting not just mccain and obama but biden and palin
9367913 shes great on our issues and bidens been terrible for 35 years
9367914 what do you want first the good news or the bad news
9367915 grande gara mi dispiace per il ritardo dei tifosi ma non dipende dal club
9367916 avremmo meritato qualcosa in pi nel finale loro cercavano la mischia in area
9367917 col benfica occorre unimpresa gargano ha qualit da trascinatore russotto potrebbe essere la sorpresa
9367918 grande gara mi dispiace per il ritardo dei tifosi ma non dipende dal club
9367919 the idea that women are going to race off to vote for any candidate with the same internal plumbing is both offensive and historically wrong hillary clinton didnt run for president as a symbol but as the best prepared candidate in the democratic pack palins nomination feels in comparison like a step back
9367920 waterboarding to me is torture okay and waterboarding was advocated by the administration and according to a published report was used
9367921 maybe devoting some of the activities to bringing the american peoples attention to trying to help the hurricanes victims
9367922 we dont want to appear in any way festive when you have that kind of tragedy possibly revisiting itself on the city of new orleans and areas around it
9367923 a partner and a soulmate a person who will help me reform washington and change the way they do business
9367924 john mccain was forced to come back and pick a sort of cheney esque social conservative whos going to satisfy the base
9367925 weve been warning against the third term of george bush with the choice of governor palin its now the third term of bush cheney
9367926 the people who supported hillary clinton are not going to be seduced just because john mccain has picked a woman
9367927 to prove to the american people that the person that youve chosen can fill in tomorrow
9367928 i think what he was looking for is a partner to tell a story about what he wants to do in washington
9367929 what has he done what has he done what has senator obama done in terms of managing a war
9367930 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9367931 i dont represent the government or anything but from the humanitarian aspect its very important that we continue to get aid in
9367932 im offended by barack obama saying that about my husband
9367933 my husband was a navy boy his father and mother were in the navy i mean theres nothing elitist about that
9367934 one of the objectives is to be able to relate to and meet and address the needs of average americans
9367935 if this is a change election its about changing washington so that it works again
9367936 so that this alliance of partisan political power brokers and special interests peddlers is broken
9367937 its respectful but first of all i also at that time asked senator obama to go to town hall meetings with me we could appear in front of the american people the way barry goldwater and jack kennedy had pledged to do
9367938 ill tell you that changes the tenor of a campaign i know because ive done them in the past
9367939 earlier this year mccain voted against making the cia subject to the act
9367940 we dont want to appear in any way festive when you have that kind of tragedy possibly revisiting itself on the city of new orleans and areas around it
9367941 question and comment to mr mccain why did you allow bush to get away with torture and essentially sanctioning it
9367942 people are hedging off their risk so they can protect themselves
9367943 with so much production being offline people are getting nervous
9367944 were not trading as high as some may have thought partly because the storm has weakened a bit and partly because it looks like people are prepared for this
9367945 in times of emergency it is very important to have the markets opened
9367946 people need to protect their positions if theyre exposed to market changes
9367947 that 15 looks small but bear in mind that the u s is a huge country
9367948 thats about 2 4 million barrels that have been lost which would normally go as far as the atlantic coast states and the midwest by tuesday places as far as chicago will feel the impact of this
9367949 most refiners are already operating at full capacity so the others wont be able to meet much of the shortfall
9367950 i was very happy to have everything right i thank the leaders of panathinaikos which have always been very professional and very fair with me because they released me
9367951 said dante who will be fighiting in russian superleague against his national teammate giba iskra odintsovo
9367952 an aging facility and a bad storm are not a good combination to say the least kirschner said
9367953 but the doctor also told me that more was being affected than should be with two discs pressing
9367954 when i reached the ninth floor it said the eleanor and lou gehrig mda als research center
9367955 in the last two years they raised more than 250 000 for research
9367956 gary comes from such an interesting career path and he took something in his life that was not great and made it something with a positive outcome
9367957 basically when i wake up every morning the fact that i can do whatever i want to do has made me appreciate my life so much more
9367958 it was definitely a tough day in fact a tough day for everybody it has been tough to avoid mistakes here and i think i did well to get four rounds under par
9367959 earlier the outflow was taking place only from the main course but now after flooding the areas under its changed course the river water is falling into the ganga at kursela from a new side as well
9367960 fifteen boats and 40 navy personnel joined the rescue operations
9367961 im not top fit but i need to do everything to be top fit fight every point
9367962 im really happy to win three rounds in three sets i hope i will be fit and feeling good for the fourth round

9367980 monty only managed to leave a voice message i could sense he was disappointed but he wished me well and wished the team well
9367981 ive been watching these guys through the summer ian is a very determined guy i love his attitude and what he did at the open that back nine he played with the intention to win and had that emotional feeling
9367982 maybe i should have gone to play gleneagles but i stuck by my word looking back at the time i made the right decision for me but it was so difficult to choose the right thing to do and its obviously been a very difficult decision to try to get across
9367983 i think i will bring my best game excitement flair and the passion that i always play golf with
9367984 i think i will be a strong asset to the team ive been looking at the points list every single week since the open and i thought the only scenario that would put a spanner in the works was darren playing well
9367985 ive been watching paul play and he has been playing absolutely the best through the summer
9367986 i was waiting for the putting to turn around that has been very important he has an extremely good record in the ryder cup and going back the walker cup
9367987 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9367988 there was a qualifying period and i didnt make it automatically so you will not hear any sour grapes from me i couldnt have tried any harder and i devoted myself to the european tour to give myself the best possible chance but although i have won twice this year it obviously wasnt enough
9367989 i fully respect the captains decision and i would like to wish him and his team all the very best for valhalla i will be supporting them from wherever i am

9367993 we can still have very regal looking guards who look fantastic
9367994 we felt doing this kind of thing was a way of keeping with the times and keeping that iconic status
9367995 most people think its fake fur and when they find out its real and it takes one bear to make a hat they are appalled
9367996 fur farming has been outlawed in britain but we are paying other people with taxpayers money

9368008 i wouldnt put microsoft as being the arbiter of what should and shouldnt be tracked
9368009 i think microsoft realizes we all realize that its a beta version and its sure to change before its finalized
9368010 i guess its just nice to play well pretty simple
9368011 it was one of my goals coming into this season next to trying to win wimbledon i missed that one oh well
9368012 we have won a stage and placed myself as leader just like we did in the tour de france which was my aim for the day
9368013 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight

9368016 i just got a bit more defensive i felt a little bit tired she took advantage of that
9368017 the amount of data measured is aggregate monthly usage of uploads and downloads
9368018 its no secret weve been evaluating a specific monthly data usage or bandwidth threshold for our comcast high speed internet residential customers for some time
9368019 we need to remember that the amount of usage we are talking about more than 250gb a month does not apply to more than 99 percent of our customers so the less than 1 percent who are notified today receive a phone call from comcast asking them to moderate their usage which the vast majority of them do voluntarily
9368020 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
9368021 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
9368022 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
9368023 while these concerns are understandable their actual impact likely is overstated although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise there are likely to be few in which a copyright owners determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation
9368024 considerable doubt that lenz will be able to prove that universal acted with subjective bad faith
9368025 while the court merely declined to throw the case out at this early pleadings stage
9368026 we remain confident that we will prevail in this matter
9368027 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9368028 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house

9368031 the army corps of engineers informs me that while the levees are stronger than theyve ever been people across the gulf coast especially in new orleans need to understand that in a storm of this size there are serious risks of significant flooding
9368032 my message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9368033 i sent my son out with a camera and said
9368034 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
9368035 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
9368036 adolf said that he wanted to kill obama on his inauguration
9368037 stated that he believed that gartrell was also present in denver co to assist adolf in killing obama
9368038 but we felt like this was a move we had to do
9368039 hes had a good preseason he played well the other night against new englands starters he can fit in the rotation and be a part of any third down package or second and long package we have were constantly trying to upgrade obviously in this situation some attention had to be spent on the defensive end spot we think this is going to be a real good investment for us
9368040 the problem is that real madrid did not manage to recruit
9368041 our thoughts and prayers are with the families in the region
9368042 like all americans were watching whats going on along the gulf coast and keeping the communities there in our thoughts and prayers were going to continue to monitor the convention but right now our top priority is the safety of the families along the gulf coast
9368043 if the hurricane reaches the proportions they believe that theyre going to reach and it becomes a three or greater i think it would not be a good idea for us to be here and breaking bread and having a convention
9368044 absolutely im disappointed i think the kind of convention we would have had this week would have been something that would have helped john mccain a great deal
9368045 by the way we aint counting on any recounts we aint counting on any overtimes
9368046 ohios got to make sure theres no overtime this time ok
9368047 because until barack obama puts some real people on the supreme court we cant count on its being fair

9368091 we have activated our emergency operations center as well as our reception center
9368092 they will walk through the scanner and it automatically loads into the computers we have a list of where they need to go
9368093 with hurricane katrina we had no system families were calling wanting to know where family members were and we had no way of finding out this way we have a better way of tracking where people are going

9368235 the shuttle is an inherently risky design we currently assess the per mission risk as about one in 75 of having a fatal accident
9368236 if one were to do as some have suggested fly the shuttle for an additional five years say two missions a year the risk would be about one in 12 that we would lose another crew
9368237 the shuttle programme in conjunction with constellation and space station have been asked by the administrator to put together some manifest options to assess extending shuttle flights to 2015
9368238 we want to focus on helping bridge the gap of us vehicles travelling to the space station as efficiently as possible
9368239 the parameters of the study have not yet been defined

9368270 there is no explanation for this performance of course you can always have a bad day but to display the lack of passion that we did today is something ive never experienced before i have seldom been so disappointed the way we played today hurt a lot more than the three points that we dropped
9368271 without disrespecting gladbach we should simply be the better team we knew that it wouldnt be easy here and that we would have to be determined and aggressive but all of that was missing you cant go away and play like that we just took everything as it came when you are 0 3 down and nothing is working then you have to start thinking about what needs to be done we collectively failed to fulfil the task in hand
9368272 gladbach played well they were energetic aggressive passionate up for the battle all things that we were missing if you dont give your all when the basic attitude towards the task is wrong and you think you can get things going just with an ability to play football then you wont win a single game
9368273 you couldnt have seen that coming we trained well everything worked out nothing worked out today
9368274 that is a botched start we only have ourselves to blame we certainly expected to be in a very different position in the table after three matches
9368275 we must acknowledge now that with the exception of the first half against schalke nothing has worked out this season so far the way we planned it if we are to achieve our targets then we cant allow for such blackouts that was a major shot across bows
9368276 we have plenty to talk about to ensure the healing process begins here and now we will again make it absolutely clear that no matter how good you may be if you dont put in the effort you wont have success
9368277 we wont be making any new signings before the transfer window closes but things are going to get a little uncomfortable for the players

9368394 palin is commander in chief of the alaskan national guard
9368395 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9368396 there are a lot of other republican women who could have filled this role if that is what he was looking for
9368397 maybe its my own background as a mayor and united states attorney but this whole idea of executive experience to me would really qualify her
9368398 you know why she had to make decisions all sen obama has had to do is talk thats all he does
9368399 no doubt the campaign staff have her hooked up to a fire hose on foreign policy issues
9368400 no doubt they fear a debate with joe biden that touches foreign affairs
9368401 my guess is graham and joe lieberman are doing a lot of tutoring

9368435 if you really believe that those towers came down because an airliner hit them then the joke really is on you larry silverstein is on tape saying we decided to pull it they decided to pull a building perfectly demolish it without prior planning are you sure this is all well documented and acknowledged bbc reported the tower collapsing before it happened i am not an idiot but i think that 911 was staged and no one will convince me otherwise my italics
9368436 when intelligent level headed people do entertain these theories you may be wiser to more closely examine the evidence rather than shut it down with youre a nutter thoughts someone gave the command to stand down the air force which effectively allowed the attack and if it was incompetence no one has ever been punished for it
9368437 these theories are fanned by the fact that there are so many dubious forces at work why is it that all the recent presidential candidates in the usa are all members of a highly secretive group that formed both the nsa and the cia skull and bones and that this group pledges loyalty to each other above all others bush 1 and 2 kerry and obama and mccain are all known members there are so many dirty aspects to the upper echelons of power and while they exist the flames of conspiracy theory will be fanned

9368463 there is no need to change the capital structure in ongc videsh despite its large takeover bid for imperial the entire funding will be provided as loan to them
9368464 we have already provided financial support to ongc videsh to the tune of rs 12 000 13 000 crore in the past as loan
9368465 we are a cash rich company and funding is not a problem ongc has reserves of about 4 3 billion and out which cash of 2 billion
9368466 we will go for 1 billion bridge funding and rest 1 8 billion would be from internal resources
9368467 the 45 days from the bid are very crucial i am deliberately not speaking much on details as it may create problems now if everything runs smoothly we expect to crystallise the deal in the next one and a half month of time
9368468 i have recently written to chief ministers to consider opening up educational institutions at high school level and above after class hours for those agencies and groups who are engaged in skill development for our youth
9368469 it our endeavour to achieve a target of five lakh persons per year by the end of the 11th five year plan under the skill development programme
9368470 around 37 lakh new employment opportunities would be created under the newly launched prime ministers employment generation programme pmegp in rural and urban areas for establishing micro enterprises with the assistance of rs 4 735 crores from the government of india and this would lead to an investment of about rs 15 000 crore
9368471 our merger and acquisition team has been mandated to look for iron ore and coal assets both abroad and in india for acquisition
9368472 however it is not in the race to acquire united coal the us based firm that is now on the block
9368473 energy constitutes one of the biggest components in the operating costs of a mobile operators and so it can cuts operating costs by about 35 per cent
9368474 the communication networks are reaching the rural areas with no electricity grids or other infrastructure considering that base station sites need to run autonomously the diesel generators are used traditionally and they are environmentally unfriendly so we are offering bts based on renewable energy like sun and wind
9368475 green power is already commercially viable in many instances the renewable energy system performs better with smaller loads that is the case of bts as well in all bts scenarios with a base load of one kilowatt green power pays back in about three years green power can also solve the issue of noise and safety of fuel transportation associated with the diesel
9368476 a huge number of subscribers in the rural areas are availing mobile services where energy cost plays an important role due to the lack of continuous power supply the telecom operators need to depend upon diesel that results in a high costs
9368477 my gut feeling is that inflation has peaked as food prices have stabilised or have started coming down
9368478 the demand for oil has already come down because developed countries have passed the high prices to the consumer
9368479 if what reliance is saying about its gas discovered in kg basin turns out to be true then our dependence on oil import will come down considerably in next few years
9368480 if inflation peaks i don t think the tightening is needed they are basically keeping an eye on the liquidity and essentially on credit expansions
9368481 so it can effect adversely certain sectors along essentially controlling inflation
9368482 we have no intention of reducing prices of our existing pizzas as we are already offering good value high quality pizzas
9368483 we have discontinued our rs 49 6 inch pizzas in tier ii and iii towns and have replaced it with an 8 inch pizza which costs rs 80 because people in these towns are willing to pay the price for a good product we do have 6 inch pizzas for rs 54 but they are available only in our express stores
9368484 we have done this to protect our topline on delivery but we offer single rs 35 pizzas on take away or dine in orders
9368485 it is impossible to sell pizzas for rs 35 without compromising on quality and taste and therefore we will not reduce our prices
9368486 we will fight competition every inch of the way on taste quality and presentation of pizzas but not on price
9368487 we have a captive customer base and very minimal marketing costs which is why we can accept lower margins in our captive outlets

9368536 this immunisation programme is another weapon in our fight against one of the most preventable cancers
9368537 every year approximately 160 women in new zealand are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 60 women die from it in the long term we expect this new programme to save more than 30 lives each year and thousands of abnormal smear results which means less stress for those women and their whanau
9368538 i encourage all eligible young women to access the ministry of health resources and information about the programme and to have a discussion with their families and health professionals about the issues
9368539 it appears to be a party trick that has gone wrong
9368540 this looks like a planned event there will be a reason for it and that is what we will work to establish

9368543 if they can become patriotic and believe in whats happening in south africa and not look for their honey outside of the borders and offer support rather than stomping on people who gave them hours and hours of joy last year and this year we as a nation will grow much better
9368544 we didnt go out there to show them that they were wrong we went out there to exactly showcase our talents and the belief that we do have in ourselves
9368545 the same people who threw their robes on the ground when jesus rode on a donkey were the same people who crowned him and hit him with sticks and stuff like that and were the same people who said afterwards how we shouldnt have done that hes the son of god
9368546 when you pick the wrong word your readers laugh at your amusing sentence its great to put them at ease with a joke or two but if theyre smiling at what you wrote in all seriousness thats not good other readers dont laugh they cringe and wince lament and vent some sticklers just stop reading
9368547 make a commitment to practice and rehearsal with the equipment that you will use during your presentation it will make your presenting life much easier
9368548 a common presenter mistake is to run out of time even when youve practiced you sometimes find yourself rushing the last five or ten minutes of your presentation wondering where the time went well heres an easy solution
9368549 ive kept both responses in mind over the years whenever considering a potential crisis and have asked what if this is one of those occasions when those students are correct
9368550 how do you keep track of everything how do you remember to send your introduction a week before the presentation do you even know who to send it to the easiest way to deliver powerful presentations every time is by creating a simple project plan of the work to be done and then working your plan in this podcast you can learn how to use project management principles to plan your next presentation
9368551 another very handy place to use this technique is in the practice of presentations its all very well to be prepared but if something goes awry a cell phone rings the wrong slide pops up its easy to panic anxiety and stress sweaty palms physical tremors accelerated heart rate and more when this happens we begin to focus on the feeling of anxiety and not whats happened to interrupt the presentation
9368552 this poor woman utterly lost her audience hers was the one subject of the day that any doctor should have been interested in but they were now going to remember her presentation for all the wrong reasons

9368566 we were very keen on the idea and we spent a lot of time researching it the idea was we were going to link in with pipe networks
9368567 then pipe did a beauty contest to see which was the best partner to have in new zealand and when the government announced it was making 15 million available it kind of pushed the thing into soe territory and us out the picture which was a real shame
9368568 we think there is a lot of demand out of wellington and it would be good for the region it is also good for the country to have a bit more physical diversity
9368569 until you sit down in front of customers and ask them to sign a contract you are never one hundred per cent sure

9368575 this looks like a planned event there will be a reason for it and that is what we will work to establish
9368576 with the information we currently have it appears this shooting is not random
9368577 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now
9368578 any country that has a potential separatist movement will view the events in georgia through its own unique prism

9368580 do not put yourselves in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9368581 and know that the american people stand with you well face this emergency together
9368582 shes got the right judgement she doesnt think like senator obama does that iran is a minor irritant
9368583 shes been a commander in chief of the alaska national guard
9368584 when people dont have much money they cut on big stuff and buy things that make their lives a little bit better like consumer electronics
9368585 i cant afford gas to go anywhere but this new gps is so bright and shiny
9368586 we used to cut down many trees for agricultural use which brought us a lot of hardship including windstorms decreased rainfall and increased solar intensity
9368587 palin 44 has been the joan of arc of alaska politics charging into battle against long odds on such big local issues as oil taxes and construction of a natural gas pipeline only to see her opposition crumble
9368588 palin 44 is a first term governor known for being a maverick whos willing to challenge her own party a key trait that mccain hopes will help him attract independent voters shes perceived as an ethics crusader and reformer within a state republican party thats been rocked by scandal credentials that also enhance mccains similar image
9368589 it is true as the statement said that palin has a record of bipartisan reform she has a growing reputation as a maverick for bucking her partys establishment and alaskas powerful oil industry
9368590 made her considerable alaska reputation by taking on establishment politicians
9368591 sen john mccains surprising choice for vice president alaska gov sarah palin appears to be every bit the maverick he is a dyed in the wool conservative palin nonetheless made her considerable alaska reputation by taking on establishment politicians even bringing ethics charges against fellow republicans
9368592 palin 44 a maverick governor and a staunch anti abortion pro gun rights conservative is a political outsider who has five children and a working class background
9368593 she has a reputation for rankling the gop hierarchy in the conservative state
9368594 she can get in there and compete with anybody i mean she was in a tough campaign she has been a hard nosed fighter not only for republican values but also in her state and she has been successful
9368595 took intense criticism from members of her own party for turning the spotlight on the failures of alaska republicans
9368596 but ms palin ran as a change agent when she was elected as governor of alaska in 2006 and in a move that might have appealed to mr mccain she took intense criticism from members of her own party for turning the spotlight on the failures of alaska republicans some of whom had been beset by corruption scandals
9368597 sen john mccain made an inspired choice in picking alaska gov sarah palin as his running mate
9368598 on the other hand the record shows that sarah palins political career is a case study in taking on the big boys we suspect her record of fighting the status quo was uppermost in john mccains decision
9368599 rose to the statehouse by challenging the corruption that has become endemic in alaska even if it meant taking on the republican establishment there
9368600 palin a 44 year old mother of five who hunts caribou and was once a beauty queen rose to the statehouse by challenging the corruption that has become endemic in alaska even if it meant taking on the republican establishment there including the former governor and the states congressional delegation
9368601 she was not only a surprise choice but also an electrifying choice
9368602 sarah palin changed all that she was not only a surprise choice but also an electrifying one and her selection has far reaching implications her entry will change the nature of the presidential race and if the mccain palin ticket wins it has the potential to carry republicans through a rough patch and even ensure conservative dominance of the party for years to come
9368603 she has been governor of the state while obama has been pretty much an absentee senator running for senate
9368604 obama has no experience obviously he was a state senator sarah palin has much more executive experience she has been governor of the state while obama has been pretty much an absentee senator running for senate
9368605 in selecting a washington outsider the original maverick opted to double down on his reform credentials while also making a pitch to undecided women voters
9368606 she was elected governor in 2006 and took office in 2007 her accomplishments reflect and even echo mccains reform agenda
9368607 but as a governor as an elected governor of a state an executive she has more experience than barack obama and joe biden do sarah palin is the only candidate who will appear on the presidential ballot who is able to say that she has executive experience and has run a government that is nothing that joe biden or barack obama can claim
9368608 by picking alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has wowed the public and enthused the right he has reinforced some of his winning themes that he has the mindset of an outsider and a fighter against corruption he has also reinforced his appeal as the candidate more in touch with traditional values on moral issues
9368609 it will go down in history as one of the boldest most deft and wonderfully strategic vice presidential picks ever palin has the same maverick reputation as sen mccain and has been a pull no punches reformer in the last frontier she even took on the ethically challenged hierarchy of her own state gop
9368610 if anything her zeal for busting pork barrel spending may outstrip mr mccains
9368611 she unseated a sitting republican governor in a primary by running against the republican establishment in alaska if anything her zeal for busting pork barrel spending may outstrip mr mccains and shes spent her time in office fighting for ethics reform
9368612 as a governor she has more executive experience than mr obama
9368613 are more likely to clash with special interest groups than are obama and biden
9368614 her reputation as a reformer in alaska dovetails with sen mccains image too
9368615 wed say governor palins credentials as an agent of reform exceed barack obamas
9368616 for starters wed say governor palins credentials as an agent of reform exceed barack obamas mr obama rose through the chicago democratic machine without a peep of push back alaskas politics are deeply inbred and backed by energy industry money mr obama slid past the kind of forces that mrs palin took head on
9368617 in choosing palin mccain also doubles down on the maverick argument palin is the face of reform in the republican party nationally and is clearly not of washington a key element of her biography given how negative voter sentiment toward the nations capital is currently
9368618 earned a reputation as a reformer taking on republican leaders on ethics issues
9368619 palin has earned a reputation as a reformer taking on republican leaders on ethics issues she opposed pork barrel projects backed by her party and helped kill the project known as the bridge to nowhere which had been promoted by alaskan republican leaders notably rep don young and sen ted stevens
9368620 its an out of washington breath of fresh air definitely a reformer
9368621 in turning to her mccain picked an independent figure in his own mold one who has taken on alaskas powerful oil industry and at age 44 is three years younger than democratic presidential nominee barack obama and a generation younger than mccain 72
9368622 in a state known of late for the corruption of its republican politicians palin has challenged corruption at all levels she knocked off an incumbent gop governor in the primary enacted ethics reforms and told congress thanks but no thanks on that infamous bridge to nowhere and as one of her first acts in office she sold off the jet the former governor used to get around the state
9368623 in choosing ms palin a 44 year old social conservative and mother of five who has been governor for less than two years the mccain campaign reached far outside the washington beltway in an election in which the democratic presidential nominee senator barack obama is running on a platform of change
9368624 rose to prominence as a whistle blower uncovering ethical misconduct in state government
9368625 ms palin a former mayor of the small town of wasilla an anchorage suburb and one time beauty pageant queen first rose to prominence as a whistle blower uncovering ethical misconduct in state government
9368626 in choosing an outsider like palin mccain has bolstered his case that he not obama is the real agent of change
9368627 palin former mayor of the town of wasilla built a reputation as a reformer in a state that recently has been hit with corruption scandals elected in 2006 she is alaskas first woman governor
9368628 and you know she is a reformer and she is doing great work in alaska for two years
9368629 mr mccains instinct clearly is to offer himself to voters as a reformer with sarah palin a genuine reformer mr mccain may have found the right idea and the right person to make his run
9368630 sarah palins reform resume would be remarkable in any political career
9368631 since entering politics she has shown independence and a clear moral compass
9368632 palin is a different kind of republican shes a conservative reformer who somewhat like mccain but more like ronald reagan is forever poised to challenge the sluggish or corrupt republican establishment and shake up the status quo
9368633 and she has a record of integrity matched by few elected officials
9368634 and she has a record of integrity matched by few elected officials mrs palin resigned in protest in 2004 as head of the alaska oil and gas commission over alleged ethical violations by the state republican chairman a commission member two years later she upset republican gov frank murkowski in the primary and defeated a democrat in the general election
9368635 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics governor palin has quickly become a leader on this issue she is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
9368636 but shes an expert on one of this years biggest issues energy
9368637 on the other hand sarah palin out of alaska would certainly know a thing or two about energy given the fact that alaska produces oil for the united states
9368638 shes already engaged in the energy debate boosting domestic supply with increased production from her resource rich state of alaska
9368639 arguably brings more credibility on the topic of energy than anyone else on the two major tickets
9368640 palin took on the oil producers there saying they had been dragging their feet on a gasline and she pushed the legislature to pass a bill authorizing an independent company to build the line
9368641 during her first year in office palin moved away from the powerful old guard of the state republican party and has refused to kowtow to the powerful oil industry instead presiding over a tax increase on oil company profits that now has the states treasury swelling
9368642 yet she also not shied from confronting exxon mobil bp and conocophillips
9368643 she has tangled with exxon mobil and other oil companies over their reluctance to develop gas fields on state land
9368644 gov palins interest in speeding up development of the states resources in part to boost revenues to the state and provide jobs is evident in her clash with exxon mobil earlier this year she attempted to revoke exxons license to the point thomson oil and gas field one of the largest undeveloped fields in the u s for failing to develop it quickly enough the company hasnt drilled a well there since 1982 on thursday exxon said it has brought in equipment and was preparing to drill a well this winter
9368645 palin has long experience dealing with big oil in home state
9368646 sarah palin has pushed oil companies to move faster with projects to expand oil and gas production
9368647 since becoming alaskas governor in 2006 sarah palin has pushed oil companies to move faster with projects to expand oil and gas production she is widely credited with reviving a long stalled effort to build a natural gas pipeline from alaskas prudhoe bay energy fields to the lower 48 states
9368648 palin has long experience dealing with big oil in home state
9368649 they dont have big color pictures of sarah palin in the board rooms of bp conocophillips or exxon
9368650 even if they didnt know much about her going in the capacity crowd at wright state universitys ervin j nutter center roared its approval of john mccains surprise selection of alaska gov sarah palin as his running mate
9368651 and when sarah palin delivered they seemed to instantly fall in love
9368652 ive been covering the gop presidential race since november of 2006 in those many months across many states i have never seen a crowd with the energy that i witnessed yesterday at the erwin nutter center in dayton ohio yes there was an inherent buzz owing to the pending veep announcement but even after the choice was proclaimed the crowd seemed to become more jacked and when sarah palin delivered they seemed to instantly fall in love
9368653 has just come off quite well in her national debut
9368654 she has just come off quite well i think in her national debut well in one fell swoop the republicans also have something to talk about in terms of history potentially the first woman vice president the first republican woman nominated for vice president i think this is a fascinating package
9368655 thats why palins spectacular performance in her introduction in dayton was so important her remarks were cogent and compelling her presentation of herself was shrewd and savvy i heard from many who watched palin many of them not predisposed to support her about how moved they were by her remarks her composure and her story
9368656 a spectre is haunting the liberal elites of new york and washington the spectre of a young attractive unapologetic conservatism rising out of the american countryside free of the taint fair or unfair of the bush administration and the recent republican congress able to invigorate a mccain administration and to govern beyond it
9368657 i have to tell you i got a phone call from my family too and my daughter the immediate thing was wow mccain picked a woman i thought it was stunning when it happened because it is so historic the other thing i must say this is the first time that anybody who is in a national position has publicly thanked me in 24 years
9368658 well first the john mccain campaign definitely served notice that they intend to compete hard for the support of women voters of course i appreciate the reference to hillary clinton who did such a magnificent job in her campaign
9368659 you are going to have a lot of women voters wondering why senator obama didnt tap senator clinton as his running mate
9368660 to that end consider the immediate reaction of clinton adviser howard wolfson who writes today in a short piece titled ill see your biden and raise you a palin that you are going to have a lot of women voters wondering why senator obama didnt tap senator clinton as his running mate
9368661 this is a day that will go down as a turning point most likely within evangelical circles they are now fervently on board for john mccain i think weve seen a dramatic shift today
9368662 among conservatives one hears nothing but praise for governor sarah palin she is strongly pro life a long time member of the nra a fiscal hawk and an interesting combination of charm and toughness she helps to bring the party back to its conservative roots
9368663 the announcement of her elevation to the republican ticket brought an outpouring of enthusiasm from the right flank of the gop and will assure a more energized convention next week in st paul minn
9368664 evangelicals who are practically giddy at sen john mccains vice presidential pick have spent the day heaping praise on gov sarah palin
9368665 seemed to distance himself from his campaigns first harshly critical response
9368666 the obama campaigns first response was to attack not congratulate gov palin or acknowledge the historic nature of her selection
9368667 republicans say its note worthy that on the week commemorating the 88th anniversary of women getting the right to vote with mccain making a ground breaking vp pick the obama campaigns first response was to attack not congratulate gov palin or acknowledge the historic nature of her selection
9368668 obama reacted to his rivals pick of alaska gov sarah palin as a running mate and walked back a statement put out by his campaign that called the governor inexperienced
9368669 obama however declined to join such attacks and even distanced himself from his campaigns rhetoric
9368670 one of the things that the mccain campaign is suggesting is that in their reaction so negative and dismissive of sarah palin that the obama campaign may have made a tactical error in part downplaying and appearing to sound dismissive of middle american small town voters
9368671 barack obama has run a very smart campaign but made one of its dumbest moves yet in response to john mccains pick of sarah palin for veep this insider washington drivel from a campaign calling for change this from the campaign of a guy whose foreign policy experience amounts to little more than a choreographed trip with reporters in the first place inexperience is one thing in the second slot palin while its an entirely more serious concern in the top slot obama also to dismiss palins executive service as governor is completely out of touch governor has always been a tremendous plus for presidential candidates in america while there really is no category for community organizer whats amazing about this statement is not just that it was so stupid but that it was part of a prepared statement
9368672 team obama cannot even say congratulations governor palin we look forward to a spirited race nope first thing they do is attack attack attack
9368673 the high resolution images of these villages show no impact craters from incoming shelling or rocket fire or aerial bombardment
9368674 well after active hostilities ended in the area on august 10
9368675 at tomorrows european summit in brussels we will first unite to
9368676 the uk has already pledged 2m and i will urge partners to meet not only georgias immediate needs but its long term reconstruction and development needs we will deploy peace monitors to better judge violations of the ceasefire appoint a senior figure to drive the humanitarian and political effort and support the nato georgia commission with a nato team sent to georgia
9368677 there can be no return to business as usual unless and until russia commits fully to georgias territorial integrity and withdraws to its previous positions
9368678 i will argue tomorrow that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9368679 i will also be pressing european leaders to increase funding for
9368680 es contrario a una pol tica inteligente para un pueblo libre mantener grandes establecimientos militares y ej rcitos en tiempos de paz tanto por los enormes gastos que requieren como por el hecho de que sirven como medios aptos en manos de gobernantes ambiciosos y sin principios para subvertir el gobierno o pisotear los derechos del pueblo

9368715 pub charity stuff has decreased quite substantially and more people are wanting a slice of a diminishing pie
9368716 people have to decide whether they fill their car up or pay the school donation
9368717 the overall amount of money has declined and in inflation adjusted terms it has declined significantly
9368718 my first reaction to this is i told you so
9368719 weve got less money and its going off in other directions
9368720 we add some numbers to our flock and when our flock goes to the freezing works we say 20 of those need to be allocated back to the school account
9368721 its another mechanism by which you can use the resources of your community
9368722 where does that leave us running fairs to pay for it
9368723 fundraising sometimes can be really hard and a lot of the parents just end up putting in extra money
9368724 just to put a different drive on the fundraising one of the mothers had access to make up brand mary kay and its been the best fundraiser weve ever had

9368726 my dad says if you touch the tiger then we take the photo
9368727 we know from previous scientific research that boys who have active and involved fathers are more likely to do better academically socially and emotionally
9368728 given that many dads of today credit their father as being their most important teacher of life skills underscores just how important male role models can be for young boys
9368729 the language of fathering is all about doing things sometimes its kicking a football around other times it might be helping to tinker around with the car
9368730 this is still a big ugly storm still strong and i encourage everyone to leave
9368731 i cant take a chance because so many people died in katrina
9368732 i was here for katrina and i was going to stay but this ones coming really bad and i decided to get out
9368733 the wind looks to be stronger this time im scared it will rip the roof off
9368734 it remains likely that gustav will prove to become a worse case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage
9368735 if they can become patriotic and believe in whats happening in south africa and not look for their honey outside of the borders and offer support rather than stomping on people who gave them hours and hours of joy last year and this year we as a nation will grow much better
9368736 we didnt go out there to show them that they were wrong we went out there to exactly showcase our talents and the belief that we do have in ourselves
9368737 the same people who threw their robes on the ground when jesus rode on a donkey were the same people who crowned him and hit him with sticks and stuff like that and were the same people who said afterwards how we shouldnt have done that hes the son of god
9368738 the second series seems to me like it would be a good end to the show i feel like another 10 that will be enough
9368739 there are quite a few things in the wind i think they want to put a few more things under their belts
9368740 theyve done a huge amount of touring its just got out of control theyre definitely developing a show thats going to play big spaces
9368741 the group expects to be able to advise the market of specifics in this regard by late september
9368742 it was a well equipped racing yacht for whatever reason it just tipped over
9368743 the pricing wasnt right it took too long but the tour was wonderful
9368744 there are a lot of wine tours with a food component but not many the other way round
9368745 its just fun to be able to start the ball on line and read it right and then to be hitting the shots where youre looking
9368746 these are the days you look for when you play golf because its just kind of coming out just always the way you want it to and just a spectacular day
9368747 i was really struggling coming into this week and i was just having a hard time sleeping after friday night after the first round just because i wanted to play well again so bad
9368748 i read this scripture in mark 11 where it says cast your burden on me and i will give you rest
9368749 i just felt an incredible amount of peace and confidence as i played and it was just a really fun day
9368750 the thing my caddie and i brett were able to talk about is that you know what you might hit some great shots that might not work out at all you might catch the wrong gust here and there or whatever so just make the stroke do the best you can and let the results be the results
9368751 things just kind of kept going the right direction i was able to capitalize on the putts and turn it into a great day in the midst of some tougher conditions
9368752 in front of her are a blackberry and a cell phone devices that rarely leave her side
9368753 hes on that blackberry and his phones constantly i wont let him drive the car because everythings ringing i say pull over its too dangerous
9368754 one of the things that happens is that the public is coming to grips with how to deal with this instant unfiltered information that may be deliberately mis edited but i think and this is naive maybe i have confidence that the american people will put this in perspective like when one of the bloggers said were going to take back the democratic party they dont own the democratic party what are they talking about
9368755 there were rumours around but i think it was when i saw the e mail referring to the donation in the new zealand herald
9368756 three hulled wonder yacht designed to crush its competitors in the next americas cup
9368757 this is obviously the last thing we wanted but having said that i think these are really important issues
9368758 winning the americas cup in my view is not only about money and numbers
9368759 its like winning no matter what and that i cant respect
9368760 i think that location based services are game changing at the same time lbs is still at version 5 not even 1 0 yet the main one phweet conversation over aircell

9368775 hes a big tall left sided defender who will bring physical attributes to our team due to his sheer size

9368777 hes been brought in to increase competition at centre half and im looking forward to working with him and helping to develop his career in the premier league
9368778 at the moment there is a lot of interest from spurs its not resolved in one way or the other at the moment
9368779 those things need to be resolved and come to a conclusion at the end of the day we are still trying to build the club trying to bring good players to the club who will make us better
9368780 i need an update in fairness i need to speak to people in and around the club things may well have happened today if it doesnt happen it doesnt happen
9368781 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of the president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans

9368784 russias military hostility against the small state of georgia could have a domino effect in other countries of the region like ukraine
9368785 when the weapons fall silent it is time for diplomacy
9368786 for as long as the russian federation has not left georgia and does not fully apply the ceasefire
9368787 for us european sanctions against russia are not a priority
9368788 russias military hostility against the small state of georgia could have a domino effect in other countries of the region like ukraine
9368789 the solidity of iron is actually 99 9999999999999 percent startlingly vacuous space made to feel solid by ethereal fields of force having no material reality at all
9368790 we have no intention of limiting energy exports in any way we will abide strictly by our contractual obligations
9368791 but we are going to enlarge and diversify our export possibilities for these products which are so essential to the global economy
9368792 we have no intention of limiting energy exports in any way we will abide strictly by our contractual obligations

9368796 the shrine board will now exclusively use the land during the pilgrimage period
9368797 we are suspending the agitation for now as our main demand has been met
9368798 the proprietary status ownership and title of the land shall not undergo any change
9368799 we reject this deal but it is not a major issue for us as we are preoccupied with our freedom struggle
9368800 the death toll has risen to six and eight others are injured

9368804 ono and john saw what was happening to the world we live in almost 40 years ago and gave us this beautiful song
9368805 now when we need it the most i have been given the chance to serve it back up with a modern slant and that is exactly what i did the reason why it sounds a bit dark is because the world we now live in is a bit dark and it simply had to reflect that if john was here to see what we have done to new york and the rest of this country he would cry his eyes right out
9368806 im sore this morning but it was an amazing adventure and im glad we got to do it
9368807 this was such an extreme swim it started out cold and just got colder but this beautiful canal the guys up here with me and all the people following the journey online made me want to keep going
9368808 just spoke with jason his endurance was up and he said he would have kept swimming but the water temperature dropped to a risky 55 degrees after 10 hours and 17 miles jason was forced to give in to the elements he sounded strong but said he was looking forward to a good nights sleep
9368809 it was like somebody put the freezer on and he just got slower and slower he had the best attitude and was even on track to make it but we had to take him out it was just too risky
9368810 we wanted a family center not just for children but for adults and gatherings as well
9368811 have the courage to disconnect yourself from your material things you cannot protect yourself against what mother nature is going to throw at us
9368812 we are going to see storm surge on the west bank like we have never seen before
9368813 new orleans evacuated 10 000 people saturday local time and the estimate is 30 000 people needed to leave
9368814 the challenge seems to be that people arent listening or they are listening and deciding to stay all the coastal parishes are in very significant harms way while you can it is critical to move
9368815 if people are scared they should be scared this is not a drill we just need you to move now
9368816 an extremely dangerous storm surge of 18 to 25 feet between six and seven metres above normal tidal levels is expected near and to the east of where the centre of gustav crosses the northern gulf coast
9368817 if one major deep water production platform is destroyed youre talking about a billion dollar or more loss
9368818 if its multiple rigs and platforms in a variety of water depths then were talking billions of dollars
9368819 we are looking at different options when we have any information we will let you know
9368820 the goal is to make sure that you take the conservative approach that were not seen to be out of touch with people who could have everything they worked for lost
9368821 and no one here no one in senator mccains inner circle wants to do anything to be insensitive to what is coming and i think what is coming is a major blow to the gulf coast
9368822 shes got the right judgement she doesnt think like senator obama does that iran is a minor irritant
9368823 shes been a commander in chief of the alaska national guard
9368824 and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9368825 john mccains judgment is once again put at issue because hes chosen somebody who clearly doesnt meet the national security threshold who is not ready to be president tomorrow
9368826 if we take another hit like katrina i dont think there is any way we could rebuild again
9368827 if what happened during katrina happens again im never coming back you just get tired of it
9368828 ragged storm structure will likely prevent gustav from rapidly intensifying according to forecasters at the national hurricane center
9368829 it will lose that window for picking up some real potent high octane energy
9368830 this is not the one to play with you need to be scared
9368831 last resort shelter as there was during katrina when thousands suffered inside a squalid superdome
9368832 even if it falls just west of new orleans people in that whole neighborhood are going to feel the effects of a major major hurricane
9368833 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9368834 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9368835 we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action
9368836 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9368837 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9368838 i think we can activate an email list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9368839 we got a large plane because we needed it well take any delegate that would like to go back
9368840 we should start to see tornado threats starting tonight and in the morning
9368841 this is still a big ugly storm its still strong and i strongly encourage everyone to leave
9368842 this is the mother of all storms and im not sure weve seen anything like it
9368843 this is the real deal this is not a test for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9368844 we have double the police force double the national guard force that we had for katrina and looters will go directly to jail
9368845 you will not have a temporary stay in the city youll go directly to the big house
9368846 these numbers which are way too far apart right now
9368847 we regret the loss of civilian life but the numbers that we find on this target area are nowhere near the number reported in the media and we believe there was a very deliberate information operation orchestrated by the insurgency by the taliban
9368848 we will commit the resources if they cant we will if the bicycle teeters put our hand back on it
9368849 we can start to get into the black and still be ahead
9368850 these are investments in the future so it doesnt necessarily mean pain
9368851 we can turn those investments around into profits and still be cleaning up our act
9368852 we are looking at different options when we have any information we will let you know
9368853 the goal is to make sure that you take the conservative approach that were not seen to be out of touch with people who could have everything they worked for lost
9368854 and no one here no one in senator mccains inner circle wants to do anything to be insensitive to what is coming and i think what is coming is a major blow to the gulf coast

9368859 we are suspending the agitation for now as our main demand has been met
9368860 the proprietary status ownership and title of the land shall not undergo any change
9368861 we reject this deal but it is not a major issue for us as we are preoccupied with our freedom struggle
9368862 we remain cautiously optimistic that the dialogue is going to be successfully concluded
9368863 this is why we feel as mdc we have to be committed to the success of the dialogue
9368864 the meeting was convened because the facilitator wanted to search for a way forward
9368865 of course the talks continue there isnt a timeframe and we are not going to be obliged to impose timeframes
9368866 for us the most important thing is that these talks must continue and we must find a solution its not a pr exercise we are not going to walk like beauty queens on a catwalk we have never done that its not in our nature
9368867 zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9368868 there is nothing coming out of those discussions they are just wasting time they should just go public and say that the talks have collapsed
9368869 we have no intention of limiting energy exports in any way we will abide strictly by our contractual obligations
9368870 but we are going to enlarge and diversify our export possibilities for these products which are so essential to the global economy
9368871 russias military hostility against the small state of georgia could have a domino effect in other countries of the region like ukraine

9368882 if its multiple rigs and platforms in a variety of water depths then were talking billions of dollars
9368883 i am immensely worried about the ultimate destiny of a lot of food manufacturers in this country
9368884 globally we are seeing the growth of the majors and unless we are able to build a food manufacturing business in australia that is sustainable then ultimately the global manufacturers will take the power base
9368885 my reading is that many of the smaller suppliers have been probably been squeezed out of the industry and that leads me to a concern over the next 10 or 15 years in that its a cycle that comes and goes
9368886 who knows in 10 or 15 years time there may be a handful of global manufacturers that win back that power base and thats a frightening thought
9368887 as they drove he was shot in the temple they threw him out of the car near the hospital
9368888 he was discovered there and they quickly put him on the operating table which is where he died
9368889 a preliminary investigation is being carried out into the incident as a result of which m yevloyev was killed
9368890 this is still a big ugly storm its still strong and its still heading our way
9368891 the forecasters are saying this is going to be worse than anything they have ever seen and they absolutely do not want people taking chances
9368892 this hurricane wont just affect new orleans but that city still hasnt recovered from katrina and the levees will never be able to take gustavs storm surge of over 20ft no way
9368893 vladimir putin not only managed to see the giant predator up close but also saved our television crew too
9368894 first of all we must thank our colleagues americans european colleagues for being involved with this during a difficult time for russia when no one was paying any attention to this
9368895 these last few days i saw that agostini was a little unhappy today though i saw him smile he came to greet me wished me well and i won
9368896 we have a 75 point lead which means that up to now weve been very strong weve never let up and more than everything weve kept our heads held high even during difficulties said rossi who has finished runner up in each of the past two seasons
9368897 this year i told myself that to beat stoner we needed the best valentino i tried to bring him out although youre never sure to find him i think ive found him and im happy
9368898 russia does not want confrontation with any country russia does not plan to isolate itself
9368899 everyone should understand that if someone launches an aggressive sortie he will receive a response
9368900 europe can do a lot starting with sending a mission of civilian monitors which would lead to an international peacekeeping mechanism that would replace the presence of russian troops
9368901 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9368902 europe would only be hurting itself if we were to get full of emotion and slam all the doors shut to the rooms that we will want to enter afterwards
9368903 stop well short of any action that might escalate into a damaging tit for tat sequence of
9368904 what happened in georgia shows even more why it is crucial that europe begins to move more quickly to diversify its supply of gas
9368905 i look forward to each of them making a positive contribution to the law in their new capacity
9368906 i sought expressions of interest and nominations undertook extensive consultations and i appointed a high level panel to assess candidates and recommend suitable candidates to me

9368909 dont you just hate ackward silences why do we always need to speak alot of crap to make ourselves feel good
9368910 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9368911 to just have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9368912 i demand an immediate apology from michael moore to the people of south louisiana for his offensive and inappropriate comments

9368924 he knew that even though hed been shot he had to continue to protect the public
9368925 this person had shot him an obvious disregard for a law enforcement officer which indicates he has no regard for the public either

9368930 russias military hostility against the small state of georgia could have a domino effect in other countries of the region like ukraine
9368931 when the weapons fall silent it is time for diplomacy
9368932 for as long as the russian federation has not left georgia and does not fully apply the ceasefire
9368933 for us european sanctions against russia are not a priority

9368940 we have no intention of limiting energy exports in any way we will abide strictly by our contractual obligations
9368941 we remain cautiously optimistic that the dialogue is going to be successfully concluded
9368942 this is why we feel as mdc we have to be committed to the success of the dialogue
9368943 the meeting was convened because the facilitator wanted to search for a way forward
9368944 of course the talks continue there isnt a timeframe and we are not going to be obliged to impose timeframes
9368945 for us the most important thing is that these talks must continue and we must find a solution its not a pr exercise we are not going to walk like beauty queens on a catwalk we have never done that its not in our nature
9368946 zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9368947 there is nothing coming out of those discussions they are just wasting time they should just go public and say that the talks have collapsed
9368948 have the courage to disconnect yourself from your material things you cannot protect yourself against what mother nature is going to throw at us
9368949 we are going to see storm surge on the west bank like we have never seen before
9368950 new orleans evacuated 10 000 people saturday local time and the estimate is 30 000 people needed to leave
9368951 the challenge seems to be that people arent listening or they are listening and deciding to stay all the coastal parishes are in very significant harms way while you can it is critical to move
9368952 if people are scared they should be scared this is not a drill we just need you to move now
9368953 an extremely dangerous storm surge of 18 to 25 feet between six and seven metres above normal tidal levels is expected near and to the east of where the centre of gustav crosses the northern gulf coast
9368954 if one major deep water production platform is destroyed youre talking about a billion dollar or more loss

9368960 it is doubtful that there will be any kind of program tomorrow night
9368961 the convention is going to be handled on a day to day basis
9368962 and the best way we honor that is to help americans who are in need
9368963 there will be efforts to engage the delegates alternates and our friends in relief efforts
9368964 bush is fully committed to throw all the assets of the federal government into this fight
9368965 we are looking at different options when we have any information we will let you know
9368966 the goal is to make sure that you take the conservative approach that were not seen to be out of touch with people who could have everything they worked for lost
9368967 and no one here no one in senator mccains inner circle wants to do anything to be insensitive to what is coming and i think what is coming is a major blow to the gulf coast
9368968 shes got the right judgement she doesnt think like senator obama does that iran is a minor irritant
9368969 shes been a commander in chief of the alaska national guard
9368970 and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9368971 john mccains judgment is once again put at issue because hes chosen somebody who clearly doesnt meet the national security threshold who is not ready to be president tomorrow
9368972 this is the guy to have do your templates hes professional quick and creative he worked with me until the template looked exactly how i wanted to look bottom line is he does great work i will be using him in the future

9368977 because you cant you cant say that sort of thing

9368981 god i wanna see this please put this stuff out that was a great show and it influenced me so much and it was so cool
9368982 the censor sits somewhere between the scenes to be seen and the television sets with his scissor purpose poised watching the human stuff that will sizzle through the magic wires and light up like welding shops the ho hum rooms of america and with a kindergarten arts and crafts concept of moral responsibility snips out the rough talk the unpopular opinion or anything with teeth and renders a pattern of ideas full of holes a doily for your mind
9368983 the 60s were a magical time and the drug scene then was a positive scene we thought we were going to change the world and we were looking for answers today people are trying to get away from life and hide from it but in the 60s we were trying to levitate the pentagon
9368984 uh a friend of mine was playing it earlier he must have left it there

9369001 we reject this deal but it is not a major issue for us as we are preoccupied with our freedom struggle
9369002 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy they are thus part of the market failure that is climate change
9369003 there are now less than 500 days before the crucial climate change convention meeting in copenhagen in late 2009 governments should urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones that contribute to the wasteful use of finite resources and delay the introduction of renewables or more efficient forms of generation while creating disincentives and barriers to public transport up to energy saving appliances
9369004 we have no intention of limiting energy exports in any way we will abide strictly by our contractual obligations
9369005 but we are going to enlarge and diversify our export possibilities for these products which are so essential to the global economy
9369006 de spelen zouden helemaal anders geweest zijn als ik daar had gelopen zoals hier
9369007 als ik volgend jaar geen blessures krijg kan ik misschien weer aansluiten bij usain bolt
9369008 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven moore said with a chuckle in a televised interview
9369009 that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river moore said in an interview with msmbcs keith olbermann on
9369010 certainly i hope nobody gets hurt i hope everybodys taking cover
9369011 plus they think the hurricanes going to hit starts laughing new orleans about the time they start the timing at least it appears now that itll be there monday that just demonstrates gods on our side
9369012 the freshman stepped up and gave themselves a great base to work with for the rest of the season
9369013 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress
9369014 in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9369015 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9369016 the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9369017 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9369018 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9369019 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9369020 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9369021 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development
9369022 ive just got one thing to remind you of the prayer of faith avails much
9369023 she has experience not only in politics but in life
9369024 shes a mother of five children and she has more experience than barack obama
9369025 governor palin took on ted stevens if she can take him on she can take on the russians
9369026 palin is commander in chief of the alaskan national guard
9369027 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9369028 there are a lot of other republican women who could have filled this role if that is what he was looking for
9369029 maybe its my own background as a mayor and united states attorney but this whole idea of executive experience to me would really qualify her
9369030 you know why she had to make decisions all sen obama has had to do is talk thats all he does
9369031 no doubt the campaign staff have her hooked up to a fire hose on foreign policy issues
9369032 no doubt they fear a debate with joe biden that touches foreign affairs
9369033 my guess is graham and joe lieberman are doing a lot of tutoring
9369034 the experience issue is on the other side the no 1 guy there is the guy without the experience
9369035 interpret the trends of the season while keeping in mind the pocket crunching effects of the ongoing global economic recession
9369036 it does not make sense to sell now as the monthly installments that i pay is much less than what i am getting as rent
9369037 i am getting a rental income of rs 40 000 this is why i have preferred to wait till the property appreciates further rather than selling at a discount now
9369038 in delhi a similar pattern is emerging the upcoming metro rail services and the construction of the commonwealth games village have pushed up house rentals in east delhi almost at par with those in more elite south delhi colonies
9369039 rentals in the mayur vihar area have hit the roof

9369041 anshuman magazine managing director of cb richard ellis said improvement in infrastructure gives confidence to real estate investors
9369042 both for residential and commercial real estate prices are a function of demand and supply and the overall market sentiment
9369043 we are passing the full benefits of the reduced solvency margin requirement to the customer
9369044 we have seen that the mortality rate is much better than what we had predicted and so we are passing that benefit as well
9369045 term is an area that we will focus more on
9369046 the effect of reduction in solvency requirement will eventually lead to the reduction of the pricing of the term product and most of the companies will bring down with time
9369047 when the capital requirement falls the actual weighted average impact on the overall cost is not very much
9369048 we dont mind being photographed but not with those boys
9369049 if your confidence level is high and you have patience passion and stamina you will succeed in making a girlfriend in this place
9369050 jamia isnt a place where you can find dashing boys
9369051 since the caf and 233 is far from the departments teachers dont come here and thats always good
9369052 well yes and 8230 when vikramji bhatt first narrated the script to me i couldnt help but accept it and all those who have seen the film so far including few critics are very positive about it
9369053 it felt great when i was told that no one else could have done that role better than me it mattered more as it came from my director
9369054 girish has written films like gangster aitbaar and zakhm the shooting for phir will take place in london and rajasthan its about what goes around comes around
9369055 i was shooting for a raymonds ad and suddenly three girls came from nowhere one of them actually tried to kiss me on the lips and 8230 she would have succeeded had i not pushed her
9369056 but its not just girls who chase him men have also been chasing him for
9369057 well all this is part of the package abhi toh aur hoga
9369058 on the contrary my clean and devoted image will draw more attention and i would rather have people love me for my work rather than my looks
9369059 in fact playing safe is what i didnt want to do even with my first film
9369060 as indians move up the value chain large format retail combined with themed luxury environments will drive indian retailing
9369061 indians not only want to shop but want to be entertained this is the need that orchid ozone seeks to fulfill
9369062 though they are very big names and also very busy to catch hold of but my film is just 105 minutes so they could spare some time out to see it
9369063 since his film revolves around terrorism politics police and the public pandey feels
9369064 husbands come and sit quietly they just want doctors to prescribe something and get it over with they do not acknowledge it as a real condition not even the new generation of husbands in their 20s
9369065 two to five per cent of my patients come in with pms a number that has gone up by three times in the past couple of years
9369066 my boss hates it if i call in and say pms her attitude is that every woman goes through it and still works so i must be faking it
9369067 its still not taken as seriously as it needs to be but it is changing
9369068 many people ask me why i left a high paying job to do this no amount of money can make up for the joy of serving humanity when i started working in tihar the children there called any insect or animal they saw a rat they did not know what a dog or an elephant was they are oblivious to things we take for granted
9369069 i felt that i had achieved something when a 17 year old girl told me that she could never do without a chauffeur driven car but after looking at the way underprivileged kids take buses and go about the city on their own she felt liberated and now can go around the city on her own in the metro by bus or even walk
9369070 vivek sharma worked with a leading national magazine a few it companies and then quit it all four years ago to join pratham an organisation that works in rural areas for the upliftment of children he is the programme director there and feels hes become a better person now
9369071 i i feel more positive about myself in a corporate set up one is always insecure
9369072 in my previous job i travelled across the globe here i travel through remote villages and it is all so fulfilling i work at the lowest end of the pyramid and see kids become well educated observe women who were submissive become self assured and decide whom they will marry
9369073 working on an excel sheet and having a coffee vending machine
9369074 within four months i left my job and started dhriiti with my husband anirban and friend arindam
9369075 this job is extremely satisfying as there is no bureaucracy
9369076 i want to give traditional crime novel readers a more immersive experience
9369077 i personally dont have the attention economy to read a 250 page crime novel from start to finish
9369078 i realized that the way id like to consume a novel is to be rewarded every couple of chapters by seeing something visual that enhances the narrative
9369079 for instance youll watch a live snuff film that figures in the plot youll give the killer your phone number and hell call you back and youll see an analysis of photographic forensic evidence
9369080 another 6 0 magnitude earthquake is not expected in the area in the next two weeks
9369081 i have never seen something like this in my entire career they played very badly and i cannot be satisfied with this kind of effort
9369082 odafas success on the field in the past couple of years has a lot to do with his developing a inflated ego
9369083 he odafa is the best in the country so he thinks that nobody can teach him anything now
9369084 he is the kind of a player who will not pay heed to instructions he thinks he has achieved everything but if a player wants to do well he will always have to be a student of the game
9369085 a footballer should always remember that he is learning something new everyday he is learning till the day he quits
9369086 i have played the game at the highest level and they should understand that im trying to help them out
9369087 i feel whatever i say falls on deaf ears they listen to my instructions and then prompltly forget it
9369088 airlines cannot keep the base fare at rs 2 900
9369089 but the airlines dont seem keen on passing the benefit to flyers
9369090 for the time being we do not want to change our pricing strategy
9369091 we want to see the medium term development of atf prices before taking the call even with this decrease atf prices are significantly above what they were six months ago
9369092 the countrys national carrier air india is not in a mood to reduce fares either
9369093 the downward revision would help reduce losses being incurred by airlines
9369094 but seeing their cost and losses it looks difficult that they would reduce fares
9369095 we struggled to find good books as there was no library system here unlike in the us thats what inspired us we wanted to make availability of books easier for the indian reader
9369096 the books will all be like brand new therell be no pirated books
9369097 barely two days into the launch friends of books already started making its first deliveries
9369098 people have called or mailed with compliments and really valuable suggestions
9369099 but therell be a security deposit and once people realise that they are getting a good value for money service we hope theyll have the kind of respect for books and this enterprise as the metro has achieved
9369100 the big plan is to reach all over india we especially want to go to tier ii cities like chandigarh dehradun and bhopal
9369101 when you get to a certain stage you have to follow your heart youre not working for that additional one rupee but for creative and personal freedom
9369102 daylight photography was always seen as very easy in our house
9369103 night photography is where you can achieve something more than just an image you can convey a mystery and mystique its about doing something technically and creatively thats not run off the mill
9369104 from an optical point of view delhi has a range of colours sodium paper yellow whites and greens mumbai on the other hand is entirely sodium paper yellow
9369105 russias commitment to a relationship of understanding and cooperation with the rest of europe is in doubt
9369106 its up to russia today to make a fundamental choice
9369107 russia today has found itself more isolated than the soviet union ever was
9369108 what we are calling for is sanctions addressing those individuals business and officials who by their actions current or future seek to somehow continue to violate our territorial integrity
9369109 to assume a presence on the ground in support of all efforts toward a peaceful and lasting solution to conflicts in georgia
9369110 dissolving parliament is a way for the government to show responsibility if you dont want to take the responsibility on your own by resigning take all of parliament members with you by dissolving it
9369111 i will not resign or dissolve parliament i will not be defeated by those protesters
9369112 dont you feel ashamed our image as far as the rest of the world sees us will be destroyed i am the one who has taken the helm of the country the decision should be mine
9369113 one among millions of people who can drive out this corrupt government
9369114 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9369115 theres a real possibility of flooding storm surge and high winds do not put yourself in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9369116 theres a lot of preparations that have gone in in anticipation of this storm
9369117 i think we are showing that we are ready for this storm i cant stop the damage from happening and we cant stop the storm from coming in what we can do is be ready as possible making sure were ready the states are ready and the local communities are ready
9369118 everything they need from the federal government to prepare for what all anticipate will be a difficult situation
9369119 theyve made it through great challenges in the past and theyre going to make it through this one
9369120 need to understand that in a storm of this size there is serious risk of significant flooding
9369121 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9369122 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9369123 avevo promesso che sarei venuto a reclamare ci che mio e ormai dovresti sapere che io mantengo sempre le promesse
9369124 cucciolo se avessi voluto ucciderti a questora saresti gi morto

9369130 non hai proprio capito nulla non voglio trasformarti n tanto meno nutrirmi di te non mi sarei scomodato per cos poco
9369131 non aver paura non ti far del male anzi credo che ti piacer parecchio
9369132 cordelia s una cheerleader e molto pi attraente di te
9369133 devo ritenermi miracolato se ha accettato di uscire con me sapessi quello che ho passato a causa sua lincantesimo le donne impazzite tutto a causa sua
9369134 non io una mia compagna di classe una strega ma glielo avevo chiesto io
9369135 mi vuole brama di essere posseduto da me vedrai che non sar brutale come angelus
9369136 angelus ti ha offerto a me ti ho protetto da lui quando voleva venire a cercarti e ora mi sei debitore
9369137 tu avresti fatto cosa senti non raccontare storie eri terrorizzato sentivo lodore della tua paura ma sentivo anche desiderio lussuria tu ci volevi desideravi che ti scopassimo non vero

9369147 spike vai via ti prego non so come reagirebbe se ti trovasse qui capirebbe e mi ucciderebbe di botte
9369148 i think morale in the team could be a bit lower for picking poulter ahead of darren clarke
9369149 he will think about that decision for a long time
9369150 he was absolutely totally relieved it was the first time i havent heard poulter if you know what i mean he was speechless
9369151 nick faldo is his own man always has been always will be and certainly was in selecting ian poulter for a wildcard pick recent results past ryder cup performances the opinions of leading players in this team and a past
9369152 padraig harringtons successful defence of the open capped a riveting and at times tempestuous championship at royal birkdale all the talk in the build up was about the absence of tiger woods through injury and if i am honest he was
9369153 do you want me to use any other language ive just said yes there wont be a leadership challenge from me or from anybody else and im clear about that
9369154 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
9369155 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
9369156 i picked ian because he is obviously a very determined guy and i love his attitude and obviously what he did at the british open
9369157 the back nine he played there was with the intention to win he had the emotional feeling and was not playing to finish second
9369158 maybe i should have gone to play gleneagles but i stuck by my word
9369159 looking back at the time i made the right decision for me but it was so difficult to choose the right thing to do and its obviously been a very difficult decision to try to get across
9369160 nick rang me after my last round at gleneagles to say that i wasnt going to be one of his picks and i simply wished him all the best
9369161 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9369162 i fully respect the captains decision and i will be supporting the team from wherever i am
9369163 i thought it was between casey and poulter i thought clarke was a lock
9369164 but the guys he picked are really good his dilemma is a nice one to have you look at all the guys he had to choose i dont have that its not like i have a bunch of veterans with monster records at the ryder cup
9369165 tee to green paul has been playing absolutely the best through the summer and through the majors and i was kind of waiting for his putting to turn around
9369166 in the last few weeks hes been very close to being no 1 in putting averages each week so thats been very important

9369168 in a climate of funding shortfalls for education corporate sponsors are stepping up to the plate offering promotions sponsorships and even free curriculum there is no stopping the flow of advertising in covert forms its called trojan horse marketing and its designed to create life long brand name consumers not life long learners
9369169 she caught a cold her tonsils swelled up terribly and her throat hurt so much she couldnt so much as touch it since we had to administer her medicine there was nothing for it but to try it as a suppository instead
9369170 what will you give me for this lovely sharp looking colt with royal ascot written all over him
9369171 i knew before the ambulance got to me that id broken it although it was a strange sensation because i could move my ankle and toes unfortunately they couldnt find a vein so i had to go without painkillers until i got to hospital its a real kick in the balls
9369172 the boss sir mark prescott spoke to me on saturday night and said i shouldnt base my life on one horse but ill be very disappointed not to ride look here and im praying for her to win
9369173 i was hoping to be transferred back to a bury hospital by monday morning so the delay in operating means the whole thing will drag on
9369174 in circumstances such as sebs on saturday our doctor would have been on the case from 3
9369175 on saturday it was left to sebs agent and his driver with kevin darley trying to help out but none of them or us are doctors with any medical influence
9369176 pauls injury has taken some of the gloss ofthe victory
9369177 youll never meet a more down to earth level headed guy who is always there to offer help i know how much rugby league means to him
9369178 he has worked so hard to get back to fitness over the last couple of years and you wouldnt wish this on anyone
9369179 it is very disappointing for paul and a horrible injury so early in the game he was shattered
9369180 i was hoping to lift the trophy with him but unfortunately he was in too much pain to be there
9369181 youve got to feel for the guy he missed out on wembley last year and i thought he was going to have a big push and today was going to be his day
9369182 we dont know what scully is doing next year but it would have been nice for him to have put in a good performance and i was hoping it would have been the lance todd man of the match trophy for him its sad really
9369183 were all upset for him because hes a friend as well as a team mate its hard to come out with the right words and scully knows the situation
9369184 wigans was an incredible achievement but in those days they were the best club side by a mile now the competition is much stronger all round and i cannot see anyone winning three in a row again
9369185 this was my favourite challenge cup win for that reason especially scoring a try at wembley which i have dreamed about since i was a 10 year old i will savour this for the rest of my life
9369186 it was a brave effort but not a day for the purists the hot conditions ensured it was never going to be a classic and it came down to a battle of wills at the end
9369187 we almost found a way to lose and missed ample opportunities i had a bad feeling early in the second half and thought they were going to bite us
9369188 but wellens put his body on the line and is mentally strong meli was a beast and maurie faasavalu was tremendous off the bench
9369189 we want to try to avoid a repeat this time
9369190 he will go a scan and so we should know tomorrow how bad it is hopefully it will be seven to 10 days and he may only miss one game like gerrard
9369191 it was a tough game we could win or lose
9369192 having no gerrard and then torres it was a problem so credit to the players the only positive to come out of this is the fact that we have an international break so that could help
9369193 i saw a tv programme recently that said the birmingham accent was the hardest so i couldnt understand what they were singing
9369194 liverpool set out from the start with their full back alvaro arbeloa to get as close as possible to ashley young he is down and disappointed we didnt get more out of the game but that is the biggest complement he could be paid today
9369195 note zodttds repository is getting a large amount of traffic right now which is whats causes the posix connection times out refresh error
9369196 every time he was in possession he looked a threat
9369197 he will be a better player now than when he was first here and we will reap the benefits of that when you dont play regularly you doubt your own ability but a start like this will calm him down
9369198 i cannot think of one player who performed to his level
9369199 ive just read and reviewed machado de assis great 1899 novel dom casmurro for my book around the world selection for brazil my review is here for anyone interested

9369204 important the ansi c libraries are not part of the palm development platform in many cases you can perform the same function using a palm os api call as you can with a call to a ansi c function for example the palm os provides a string manager that performs many of the string functions youd expect to be able to perform in an ansi c program if you do use a standard c function the code for the function is linked into your application and results in a bigger executable

9369212 borrowing against your 401 k is a very dumb idea
9369213 number one is the opportunity costs of borrowing you end up losing the tax deferred growth potential when you take the money out of your 401 k and the interest you pay back on the loan is unlikely to earn as much of a return as your 401 k investment
9369214 im seeing a lot of people touch upon their retirement accounts for down payment money
9369215 right now real estate is a depressed market i think its a great investment
9369216 there are some clear risks of using a 401 k as a funding source for a down payment on a house you have to assess those risks and weigh them against the particular economic opportunity you have to buy a home under normal circumstances i think borrowing from a 401 k to purchase a home is ill advised but because of whats going on in the real estate market special and exceptional opportunities do arise
9369217 you cannot stop saving toward retirement just because you bought a house
9369218 my advice if you cannot afford the home without the 401 k loan dont buy the home
9369219 whether its getting a raise or a new assignment or a simple request for more office supplies asking a boss for anything can be nerve wracking

9369222 she is really just a mayor from a small town outside anchorage who has been a governor for only 1 5 years and has zero national and international experience i shudder to think that she could be the person taking that 3am call on the white house hotline and the one who could potentially be charged with leading the us in the volatile international scene that exists today
9369223 she is very very conservative and far from perfect shes a hunter and fisherwoman but votes against the environment again and again she ran on ethics reform but is currently under investigation for several charges involving hiring and firing of state officials she has no experience beyond alaska
9369224 as an alaskan and a feminist i am beyond words at this announcement palin is not a feminist and she is not the reformer she claims to be
9369225 alaskans collectively are just as stunned as the rest of the nation she is doing well running our state but is totally inexperienced on the national level and very much unequipped to run the nation if it came to that she is as far right as one can get which has already been communicated on the news in our office of thirty employees dems republicans and nonpartisans not one person feels she is ready for the v p position
9369226 shes vehemently anti choice and doesnt care about protecting our natural resources even though she has worked as a fisherman mccain chose her to pick up the hillary voters but palin is no hillary
9369227 i think shes far too inexperienced to be in this position
9369228 its as though we are balanced on the head of a pin but we dont know which way we will fall off

9369253 how water fits into the overall ecosystem is more complicated than it seems
9369254 i deeply grieve that we have to pay for what is essentially a public resource
9369255 im not sure its in our long range best interest to kick people off the land
9369256 that collaboration fosters positive relationships which are more effective over the long run
9369257 thats why we work with partners like the forest service and fish and wildlife service
9369258 that we have to cooperate with other folks to be able to do the comprehensive restoration thats needed

9369269 were going to go with the biggest story of the day tomorrow
9369270 and right now the biggest story of the day is the storm
9369271 the republican national committee has done a good job at being sensitive to not wanting to throw a party at a time the gulf coast is under siege
9369272 were trying to approach the convention with the same degree of sensitivity
9369273 is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human cancer tumors but inactive in most normal cells

9369275 magomed yevloyev was arrested today in ingushetia and was killed
9369276 along the way a shot was involuntarily fired from a policemans gun and the bullet hit yevloyevs head
9369277 explorers dont leave fellow explorers lost we want to find out what happened to our friend and colleague no more and no less
9369278 while i feel hes under our nose here hes in an area thats extremely hard to get to its the vertical terrain its the dark terrain and its the trees the vegetation
9369279 if that aircraft didnt go straight down and kind of angled in under a stand of pine trees its going to take someone physically walking upon that scene to find it
9369280 its hard to believe in this day and age that someone could disappear like this until you go up in an aircraft and look at how rough the terrain is its absolutely amazing
9369281 if we dont find steve fossett people are going to be coming out here for the next 50 years until he is found
9369282 a window unit air conditioner or the size of a shopping cart or a washing machine it could just be scattered debris

9369286 if youre good at dressing 7 to 14 year old girls it doesnt necessarily make you good at dressing teenage girl or a 25 year old
9369287 its tough to wait it out if youre not outperforming in this environment
9369288 theres no question abercrombie has figured out the teen segment pretty darn well
9369289 but theyve clearly missed on young adult segment with ruehl
9369290 its fair to say that well be watching the sales trend in ruehl very closely as we get to the end of the year and beginning of next year
9369291 so far im greatly encouraged but i recognize headwinds remain challenging
9369292 you have to give their management team a ton of credit for their discipline and focus
9369293 its tough to be in an early stage of growth in this environment its very touch and go
9369294 i wouldnt be a bit surprised if we see more fall out
9369295 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9369296 i asked her how do you feel about this this is two things you have to do is not only possibly be a vice presidential candidate but also you know listen to worry about your son
9369297 and she looked me square in the eye and she said you know something
9369298 we cant let it go we cant let a country come back in and take it back down to a soviet style government this is democracy and thats what were all about
9369299 the united states is the best at what we do were the ones that give the most and give the earliest every time something happens and id like to continue that and also encourage others to get involved you dont have to cross an ocean to be of help
9369300 my husband was a navy boy his father and mother were in the navy i mean theres nothing elitist about that
9369301 im offended by barack obama saying that about my husband
9369302 the parties are both working hard to reach out beyond their stables to offer more descriptive representation on the ticket than weve seen in a long time
9369303 who are the best possible candidates but dont really connect with the average american and this year it seems like theyre going for people who for whatever reason could make that kind of connection
9369304 i dont think were going to go back to 1900 where everybody has to be white and male to run for national office
9369305 the fact that there are all these entry points to a candidate isnt really a solution to the question can i relate enough to that candidate
9369306 what i think youre going to see in this election is a much more accurate reflection of the voting population those who actually go out and vote than perhaps any other time in america
9369307 one way or another were either going to have a president who grew up in hawaii or a vice president who grew up in alaska in the white house how much broader can you get than that
9369308 hes still influential in congress he still has supporters in congress and in the district
9369309 its really the great unknown in terms of whether people will rally around jefferson or whether they just say weve had enough
9369310 as a result of a physical exam on april 5 1968 joe biden was classified 1 y and disqualified from service because of asthma as a teenager
9369311 ive watched him under very adverse situations be as strong as steel in what he believes in holding up well and taking torture to not reveal things he believes in
9369312 hanging out with this lean good looking guy is making me feel pretty old you know what i mean
9369313 i thought i was in pretty good shape until i started hanging out with this guy you know what i mean
9369314 who said that would you say that again for my wife
9369315 would you make sure jill hears that i havent heard that in a long long long time
9369316 we dont want to build a giant factory that the market doesnt need or want
9369317 investors like to know what tax policies apply when they are putting millions of dollars down on a project theres a pretty clear history that these projects are less likely to go forward without a credit
9369318 these companies are shutting down projects firing people and its congresss fault
9369319 singulair is a really effective drug that has been on the market 10 years and has been taken by millions of patients
9369320 in over 40 placebo controlled trials no reports of suicide in singulair treated groups have been found
9369321 the evidence is good but we couldnt call it perfect
9369322 when you dont know what to look for its pretty sad
9369323 he began talking about losing the desire to practice medicine even though it was a great passion of his
9369324 for a guy who was such a family man to do that in a way that would basically ensure his family would be the first to find him was completely baffling
9369325 neurontin is an important medicine that has helped millions of patients with serious conditions
9369326 based on an extensive review of our clinical trial data for neurontin we see no evidence to support the claim that neurontin causes an increased risk of suicide related events
9369327 even though a drug is identified as a drug for weight control or smoking cessation or asthma these drugs often also get into the brain so there is always the potential for having psychiatric side effects
9369328 but we dont have any unifying hypothesis as to why very different classes of drugs have psychiatric side effects
9369329 i cant see any reason why it should not be widely and regularly used during drug development
9369330 it has been validated and appears to be a technique that is not expensive
9369331 there is no compelling reason to think that more than a few are associated with suicidality
9369332 whether or not any of these drugs cause suicidal thoughts and behavior is the critical question we need to answer up to now we have not answered that
9369333 debunking false notions of risk is just as important to the public health as knowing about risks that exist
9369334 the convention process had left them marginalized as more centrist views on issues like offshore drilling took hold

9369353 nerve impingement in his neck that has affected his shoulder and could threaten his career i had a nasty orioles flashback
9369354 i guess its just nice to play well pretty simple
9369355 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9369356 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9369357 it was one of my goals coming into this season next to trying to win wimbledon i missed that one oh well
9369358 its a goal but i want to win a grand slam
9369359 i just got a bit more defensive i felt a little bit tired she took advantage of that
9369360 why are residential rate payers paying more than their fair share if this is all about them paying their fair share
9369361 many folks like to look at elements of the package in a micro sense but looking at it from a macro sense the costs of doing nothing are going to be much more
9369362 if you look at the type of use how many hours per day the energy is taken some difference might be justified but not a factor of two
9369363 all i can say is the amounts paid by various rate classes vary in a number of complex ways the general thrust has been to try to have rate parity
9369364 were looking at all aspects and trying to make it as fair as possible
9369365 it would be difficult to make a movie about this war

9369375 he has not missed any time and he was a guy who created interest among the guys who were cut
9369376 the disconnect between the reality of this campaign and how it is perceived and presented by the mainstream media is now a major part of the years story the press dysfunction is itself a window into the unstable dynamics of election 2008
9369377 you can if you wish class all science fiction together but it is
9369378 and we were trying different things making love out by the lake to our favorite song sipping whiskey out the bottle not thinking bout tomorrow singing sweet home alabama all summer long singing sweet home alabama all summer long

9369381 this is the first real sign the tide is turning
9369382 if you are coming into university with not very good qualifications and do an arts degree at a low ranked university you are not really doing yourself any favours
9369383 having a workforce with graduate level skills has never been more important to economic success
9369384 there are also nonfinancial benefits for graduates who tend to have better jobs and healthier lifestyles be more involved in their childrens education and be more tolerant and active citizens
9369385 there are certainly young people who currently go to university who would have been better off on an advanced apprenticeship
9369386 we expect schools to be on top of the quality of teaching
9369387 i think there is still too much satisfactory teaching when you look at the attainment gap between the haves and have notes you are not going to get real success in those really difficult areas with satisfactory teaching it wasnt my phrase but satisfactory is not good enough especially in poor areas
9369388 i believe in compulsory cannibalism if people were forced to eat what they killed there would be no more wars
9369389 but that particular area of our province has been hit particularly hard
9369390 its not just crop damage the fields are flooded and its caused plants to die because of the lack of oxygen
9369391 im hoping we can get the go ahead in principle to proceed with the program and hopefully give the farmers some comfort
9369392 my goal is to offset the costs as much as we can
9369393 its an opportunity to meet with the federal minister to see where we can go to get some assistance for the farmers
9369394 he would be a good boyfriend but hes not for me
9369395 he already puts up with so much from me i couldnt possibly ask him out

9369397 he doesnt know how to play any of the songs we dont like playing
9369398 you take your clothes off so dont ask for something you cant give you cant play intensify either
9369399 me amp giuliani down by the schoolyard a true story

9369401 our country is on the cusp of a beautiful possibility lets make it a reality
9369402 we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action
9369403 on thursday at 12 21 pm we filmed the movements of a live being and it was not a pike nor a perch were sure of that
9369404 a highly advanced system on one of the cameras detected heat produced by the cells
9369405 og efter at have talt i cirka 50 minutter sad en bunke forvirrede mennesker tilbage med en lige s stor bunke sp rgsm l is r fordi lars l kke rasmussen fortsatte med at beskrive sin finanslov med forskellige ord han n ede b de at kalde den ekspansiv hvilket vil sige at den er offensiv og lukker flere penge ud til forbrug senere l d det at den var neutral
9369406 l kkes gennemgang af hovedtallene var liges kr llet som hans skjorte
9369407 ogs tallene i finanslovsforslaget s d rligere ud end de foreg ende r og det pr vede finansministeren at skjule ved at kalde forslaget for neutral finanspolitik
9369408 han pr ver at skjule at regeringen for 2009 agter at f re en ekspansiv finanspolitik ved at kalde den neutral men det er en meget ekspansiv finanspolitik regeringen l gger op til og det pr ver han med forskellige fiksfakserier at g re mindre end det egentlig er
9369409 men lars l kke rasmussen fik aldrig svaret alle de inviterede til at holde styr p dem havde han to mikrofonvogtere som gik rundt og holdt mikrofonen foran sp rgeren normalt holder journalisterne selv mikrofonen og sp rger s l s til de er f rdige s dan er det ikke l ngere hos l kke rasmussen knap var journalisten f rdig f r mikrofonvogteren sagde vupti og v k var den
9369410 et andet tegn p at finansministeren var under pres var de f sp rgsm l som journalisterne fik lov til at stille og at han ikke gik i clinch med journalisterne
9369411 we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action
9369412 we can still have very regal looking guards who look fantastic
9369413 we felt doing this kind of thing was a way of keeping with the times and keeping that iconic status
9369414 most people think its fake fur and when they find out its real and it takes one bear to make a hat they are appalled
9369415 we think we are a modern nation but the queens guards are walking round with an entire dead bear on their heads
9369416 the mod is not opposed to the use of synthetic materials as an alternative to bearskins provided such materials meet the requirement for a high quality product that performs adequately in all weather conditions
9369417 baroness taylor will be meeting representatives from peta this week
9369418 we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action
9369419 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9369420 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9369421 we dont want to solicit a bunch of canned goods that cant get there or you know bottles of water where they already have water
9369422 the thing that i am always concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether we are drawing resources away from folks on the ground
9369423 im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue
9369424 we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action
9369425 we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action

9369427 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9369428 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9369429 we got a large plane because we needed it well take any delegate that would like to go back
9369430 the mccain campaign has assured me this is the first priority
9369431 para que papa si con eso no la voy a revivir
9369432 no yo prefiero recordarla en vida como ella era cuando jugabamos cartas y tomabamos cafe con unos cigarritos si la veo muerta ese va a ser el ultimo recuerdo que tenga de ella ahi toda fria en esa caja prefiero tener lindos recuerdos de ella
9369433 amarse es mirar los dos en la misma direcci n
9369434 aquello que dijiste de que s lo se vive una vez me dej pensando mucho
9369435 all the countries in the international community are looking for more and greater leadership from the united states
9369436 i am really proud of this team and how it competed
9369437 it was a great win for our team im happy for our team but we got to learn how to play with consistency
9369438 i dont think weve been beat that bad physically probably in three years
9369439 maybe we can cover that no 88 by next week sometime
9369440 we told ourselves that nobody is going to be more physical than us nobody is going to beat us off the ball nobody is going to touch our quarterback thats pretty much what we accomplished tonight
9369441 that maybe we would melt down on the past maybe something bad would happen people would flatten out when you respond to adversity like we did tonight thats the sign of being a good competitor
9369442 i would say our team played well for an opening game
9369443 its getting harder to stumble across that quirky made in your garage stuff but its still really an amazing place
9369444 it feels more like a festival and less like an experiment in community to me
9369445 its not a let down just something you have to adjust to
9369446 dear brother so very sorry you are gone and about the squirrel monster thing miss you and your daughter still havent found the cards love rob
9369447 i had him since i was 19 i went through a lot and he was the one who kept me sane
9369448 when he died i promised i would keep his spirit alive somehow
9369449 reminds me of a petulant child with a long stick that likes to stir up ant beds just for the sake of agitating and stressing the ants
9369450 its sad how you think yourself superior to others and think of other denominations inferior to yours
9369451 you sound like an exceptionally angry kid and im sorry for you
9369452 there is an increase in contractors devising schemes to hide the violations
9369453 weve heard about folks floating around china giving courses on how to beat the inspection programs
9369454 i am happy here we get along with our boss he is very nice to us and treats us well
9369455 workers were regularly coached by contractors that if they revealed violations everyone would get into trouble the brand would pull the work they would close down and no one would get paid anyway
9369456 its a double edged sword and its either your co workers or your family
9369457 some of us are much stronger than others i know several officers who were fired they were damned good officers
9369458 the superintendent has done everything possible to ensure the officers will stay in and hes confident none of them will leave
9369459 short of another katrina our community is confident the force will take care of our needs
9369460 those problems are not indicative or reflective of the force as a whole
9369461 the force as a whole is doing a good job
9369462 i have a lot of admiration for the police that stayed
9369463 i couldnt tell you what i would do in that scenario not knowing where my family is
9369464 you cant perform your job if youre worried about where your family is regardless of your occupation
9369465 i think the city of new orleans has learned the lessons of katrina
9369466 now the old king is dead long live the king
9369467 some local law enforcement agencies and educators are asking how safe is this virtual world for teenagers
9369468 its hard to fathom there is such stuff out there for children to access so freely
9369469 if you engage in something that normalizes behavior in a way that you just couldnt teach it any better
9369470 we dont really set out to objectify anyone the pictorials glorify the women and they are always accompanied by a very fhm style interview which in a way showcases the girls personalities
9369471 despu s de dos derrotas necesit bamos empezar a hacer puntos
9369472 los muchachos se dieron cuenta de que si nos concentramos y creemos en nosotros mismos podemos jugar de la forma como lo hicimos y conseguir un punto lo cual es muy importante para nosotros
9369473 pienso que debemos respetar la calidad del tottenham ellos pusieron ocho o nueve jugadores atr s y as es dif cil crear
9369474 le dije a los jugadores que un empate est bien pero que necesitamos trabajar m s con el bal n
9369475 en la primera parte ambos equipos tuvieron m s o menos las mismas oportunidades y en el segundo tiempo creo que empezamos bien

9369500 the idea of sending an arab force to gaza is unjustified and unbalanced and it could not happen without the agreement of all palestinian factions since hamas rejects the idea it will never be implemented
9369501 the presence of arab forces on the ground in gaza can help in preventing the fighting and stopping the israeli palestinian conflict
9369502 any agreement with them will be the basis for more terror it is clear to everyone that jerusalems fate cannot be negotiated like it was a currency and certainly not with international participation
9369503 in an eventual agreement detailed expression must be given of israel interests
9369504 we must not let the pressures of time force us to make the mistakes of trying to bridge the gaps in way that will lead to a collapse or of making critical concessions just to get to a result
9369505 when people continue to die and the outbreak continues to spread then officials undertake late fire fighting measures to combat the outbreak
9369506 afterwards the officials forget what occurred and eventually wait for the next report of cholera due to the lack of a comprehensive control program such a pattern repeats itself time after time
9369507 in principle we will not discuss any list presented by the israeli occupation it must implement the list composed by us it is not fathomable that a live hostage will be released in exchange for a handful of prisoners

9369525 mccain has to pick a pro choicer to assure this or that group if he wants to win
9369526 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
9369527 i do not get into debates with the pope that is not a good idea
9369528 i dont agree with my church on abortion i understand that the church has taught abortion is a sin since its earliest days and i respect their commitment to life by not taking communion i am working to understand the churchs position better maybe i will understand and agree with the church in the future
9369529 yes i believe its a baby but that doesnt mean it shouldnt be executed for its fathers sin in the case of rape or incest
9369530 i believe we need to fund this this is a tough issue for those of us in the pro life community
9369531 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
9369532 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out

9369660 the patient is now recovering and we hope to discharge him today sunday
9369661 peace co operation and mutual assistance with abkhazia and south ossetia
9369662 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9369663 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9369664 a step towards further escalation of tensions with russia and the desire to drive the situation into an even worse deadlock
9369665 we hope that common sense will prevail over emotions and that eu leaders will find the strength to reject a one sided assessment of the conflict neither party needs the confrontation towards which some countries are being energetically pushed by the eu
9369666 further sliding to confrontation with russia and attempts to put pressure on us are unacceptable as they can entail irreversible consequences in the military political climate and in stability on the continent
9369667 how can i say no to any request from osama bin laden or mullah omar under tribal traditions if they approach me to get shelter
9369668 there would be no more powerful way of making them feel part of the olympics would there
9369669 theres no more money none from the taxpayer none from the lottery none from the government
9369670 my ambition is to see seats filled every londoner having the opportunity to see some event and people being able to come from around the country its not simple but we are determined to crack this
9369671 it was a great injustice that was done in removing competition from schools and school sports kids learn an enormous amount from the brutality of competition
9369672 like most firefights the battle was quite confused i was assessing the situation when we started taking some fire from our left flank
9369673 my men were in cover so we were quite safe the bullets were above us and close to our position so i was convinced that whoever was firing in our direction knew we were there
9369674 by that stage i thought we were going to run into a group of ana then there they were four taliban
9369675 we managed to creep up on the taliban and got quite close before they spotted us and started shooting we attacked them and cleared the position using close quarter battle skills i shot dead the first taliban fighter
9369676 he was hiding further up the ditch i saw him crawling away and thought the f ers trying to outflank us but he wasnt quick enough i broke cover and fired two shots into his chest he slumped and i could see that i had killed him i felt nothing
9369677 i looked back checked that pte carey was ok then prepared to go after the others
9369678 so i put a fresh magazine on my weapon fixed my bayonet and threw a grenade into the enemy position i moved forward with the other lad a few metres behind me we were now in the thick of it there was no going back only forward
9369679 we almost bumped into each other and that wouldnt have been the first time that has happened in the green zone i fired two shots a double tap in quick succession
9369680 i hit him twice he staggered and went down but i could see that he wasnt dead he was still a threat i was moving forward so i charged at him i was screaming my blood was up and i rammed my bayonet into his chest that finished him off
9369681 i stared into his face and i saw that i had killed him it was either him or me but i got there first he would have killed me if i had given him the chance or if he had been quicker of that i have no doubt it sounds callous i know but you dont go out on to the battlefield to make friends
9369682 so we moved on and i got another one of them in my sights and i shot and killed him and i have to say i was knackered at that stage really knackered it was at that stage i sat down and thought f ing hell but in that situation you just have to keep going forward
9369683 the guy had obviously returned he must have been very brave or stupid i had the whole section with me so we returned fire
9369684 he wouldnt have lasted long with that lot coming at him ive often wondered why he came back he had just seen three of his mates die and he legged it and then came back maybe he thought he was going to die anyway so he would take some of us with him i think thats what i would have done
9369685 ive killed men before but not that close not so that you can see the mans face when you take his life that makes it very personal
9369686 i was lucky that day we all were we were in the right place at the right time
9369687 vladimir putin not only managed to see the giant predator up close but also saved our television crew too
9369688 first of all we must thank our colleagues americans european colleagues for being involved with this during a difficult time for russia when no one was paying any attention to this
9369689 we have agreed with north korean authorities to hold a friendly golf competition between the two koreas from july 30 to aug 5 at a golf course in pyongyang
9369690 they will compete in a 36 hole competition for the prize money of 100 million won 86 000
9369691 the course is not bad north koreans seemed to keep it well managed
9369692 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9369693 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9369694 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
9369695 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9369696 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board

9369698 the welcoming committee is a criminal enterprise made up of 35 anarchists who are intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9369699 these acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses breaching venue security and injuring police officers they have recruited assistance in their criminal conspiracy from other anarchists groups throughout the country through their plans and actions they have exhibited a blatant disregard for the law and the safety of others
9369700 conspiracy to riot was the charge used against the chicago eight in 1968 as part of a politically motivated prosecution
9369701 it is a charge that is essentially used for preventive detention
9369702 we have worked very very hard to make sure weve protected peoples right to exercise free speech
9369703 to pick up a protest sign thats fine if youre here to pick up a brick or some other instrument theres a problem
9369704 i dont know what happened with the boarding but theyve corrected it and im grateful to our folks at dsi department of safety and inspections for seeing the mistake
9369705 its what my father fought in the war for to me this smacks of preemptive strike against free speech
9369706 derail rnc protest organizing efforts and to intimidate and terrorize individuals and groups converging in the twin cities to exercise what are supposed to be their basic civil rights
9369707 we just like the republicans have the right to free speech

9369763 as the game went along and i got the jitters out the game just came to me coach offensive coordintator chip kelly makes it so easy for us it took a series or two the first series i had a couple overthrown balls and you know some miscues with the receivers but a couple series is all it took to get back on our feet
9369764 we were just trying to mix it up and give them a different look when
9369765 you saw what he did he scrambled a lot and did a lot of things with his legs coach defensive coordinator nick allioti wanted to put pressure on them and make them throw the ball and i think we did that
9369766 it was like a dream when i came out of the tunnel ive been doing this since i was seven so i knew what i was going to do when i got out there i wasnt nervous just anxious to get out there and play
9369767 shutting down locker was our goal we that he was their big threat and he was he did well but the defense just did better we contained him and flew around and played fast like were suppose to it was a great game
9369768 i dont know he didnt get as many yards this time i dont think but i saw him making passes i dont think he would have made last year
9369769 we wouldve liked to hold them to zero but 10 is not too bad
9369770 with the choice of governor palin its now the third term of dick cheney because what hes done is hes chosen somebody who actually doesnt believe that climate change is manmade
9369771 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location
9369772 im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9369773 for us against hawaii we have to attack better i was impressed by hawaiis intensity on defense and its always a great opportunity for us to start the season out here in this atmosphere we relish the opportunity to play here
9369774 i think we have room for improvement we have a lot of potential
9369775 if hawaii handles the first contact like they did against us they have good odds
9369776 i wish i could have played against penn state because theyre such a good team but im happy coach dave shoji wanted me to play tonight
9369777 i think we have room for improvement a lot of people came in and did a nice job we have a lot of potential
9369778 theyre a great team we need to do what we did tonight stay composed and focused
9369779 with the choice of governor palin its now the third term of dick cheney because what hes done is hes chosen somebody who actually doesnt believe that climate change is manmade
9369780 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location
9369781 im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9369782 the first quarter we were shaking the world we had everybody sitting on their hands
9369783 speed wasnt the issue it was the fact that we didnt execute defensively special teams and offensively
9369784 ahora es el momento de irse queda tiempo tomen en serio esto no se conformen con que algunos pron sticos dicen que es un hurac n de categor a 3 puede ser mucho mucho peor

9369788 the government is closely monitoring the situation in kurram agency and has reiterated that any violence will be effectively dealt with
9369789 yeah were lucky to have a table i think we have that asteroid to thank
9369790 okay ill get the chow till you burst lobster feast we can split it all up for variety
9369791 okay so two sam adams and an infinite supply of lobster and shrimp i think i can fit that into my budget
9369792 yea now we just have to wait for our swamped waiter to arrive
9369793 were gonna have the all you can eat shrimp and lobster meals and two sam adams ales in the bottles please
9369794 one order of mozzarella sticks and could you bring us two waters as well
9369795 itll probably take about thirty minutes to prepare the first servings of the meals but the mozzarella sticks will be ready in five
9369796 so were swimming around not a care in the world when james spots these lights in the sky
9369797 its hard to say there were three bright green lights spinning each on their own axis intersecting each other and forming a point they spun so fast that you could only see the trails but the point was brighter than any star in the sky
9369798 if there was a craft it was too high to spot in the dark sky we watched the lights zoom across the heavens in a very erratic flight path
9369799 why would they fly something top secret through public airspace
9369800 yea i figured after you sharing that wicked dream you had last night with me i had to share one of the strangest events of my past with you
9369801 i remembered the girls face from the dream last night
9369802 it was you desiree theres not a doubt in my mind
9369803 no joke im not sure what it means yet this has never happened to me before im not a psychic im not even religious
9369804 i dont know what to say but my instincts tell me to trust you and i trust my instincts
9369805 you dont have to say anything just have dinner with me
9369806 okay i guess if i really did see aliens that night then anythings possible right even premonitions
9369807 i wouldnt call it a premonition perhaps it was just a sign or a friendly suggestion from fate
9369808 so is this the first time youve experienced the strange
9369809 well ive never seen a ufo but i wouldnt exactly label my past as anything close to normal
9369810 my dad died of a heroine overdose i was twelve years old i had to see him in his last wretched moments here on earth he told me never be like me best advice ive ever gotten my mom went insane in the years following she was a hard drug abuser too but managed to kick the heroine for some less deadly pleasures
9369811 it was i can only bear to sum it up getting into the heart of the details is a dangerous journey we lived off my dads million dollar life insurance policy for six years it ran out shortly after i moved out when i turned eighteen she squandered it all on pills pot booze and elaborate parties when the money ran out her mental illnesses became too severe for society to ignore her any longer she was institutionalized
9369812 no brothers or sisters no grand parents i have an aunt and uncle in
9369813 i have my cat spiderman i love him to death
9369814 im not they used to be american im not sure what my ancestry is im just a mutt like everyone else
9369815 my father leads a scientific research team there they do a lot of studies in areas the government wouldnt approve funding for
9369816 we dont talk much even if i told him he wouldnt believe me hed just think i was strung out on drugs he calls once a year to get an update on my life my mom talks to me even less
9369817 it is but at least ive got my brother charlie hell never ditch me for he loves it here hes a stereotypical surfer dude he smokes pot doesnt have a real job but hes an excellent writer hes my inspiration he makes his living selling short stories to magazines e zines and to anyone else who will pay him what hes worth
9369818 i wish i could live it but im too self conscious for it i thrive on order stability and the sanity in the universe
9369819 that one was a first i mostly dream about the past the doctor calls them night terrors ive tried lots of pills but nothing seems to help
9369820 well id like to go there with you tomorrow and help you find what you need
9369821 thats very thoughtful of you i wouldnt wanna encroach into your schedule though
9369822 oh dont worry about that i get summers off work i pretty much spend the days entertaining myself and just hanging out with friends
9369823 no but you can give me yours and if tomorrows date goes well ill give you my number and maybe even a kiss on the cheek
9369824 that sounds lovely but what if you miss and hit my lips
9369825 no i think thats going to be fine serenity check back in 5 to 10 minutes we might need some drink refills by then
9369826 they always say its going to take longer than it really will it creates a sense of appreciation in the customer for the speedy service
9369827 so youre going to leave her a good tip arent you i kinda like her
9369828 i always tip well if they do the job well i was a waiter for three years at dennys diner about 20 miles south down the coast it was my first real job before i mastered my talents well enough to teach guitar
9369829 i couldnt run it as well as sylvia does she has a gift
9369830 indeed she does these grilled shrimp never tasted so scrumptious before
9369831 so do you really wanna have our first date tomorrow
9369832 may be a path out of writers block a zero draft is what you write before you write the rough draft its a no structure no holds barred no one is gonna see this brain dump that lets you exorcise the demons or angels of this particular story so you can see what you have and begin structuring your material its the functional equivalent to dumping a box of legos out on a table to see how many pieces and what kind you have before you begin building something coaching writers
9369833 dear liz i went to report at the democratic national convention but got stuck in a five hour traffic jam i stepped out of my car and talked to denver commuters about how the convention is impacting their city some people loved it and the money it was bringing in some people hated how it brought the traffic and city services to a screeching halt but everyone had an opinion about what a mega event like this one does to a city the size of denver by the time i got to the convention i felt as if this was the story and not what was going on at the convention center sincerely a writer
9369834 when i found out about kccs rock the vote event bringing pizza toppings into the discussion seemed like a natural fit
9369835 or ice cream thats what the ferndale mirror used as an example when that city was considering a charter amendment on irv
9369836 this trial cant cover them all but i invite people to come try these five methods and talk about others like proportional representation and range voting
9369837 some we may recognize from other areas of decision making and ranking preferences like sports polls or hall of fame voting some we may see used in other parts of the world and some we may decide we like and want to use more often state law lets cities decide to use preferential balloting and ferndale did that when it adopted irv
9369838 the more we know about these different voting methods and how they affect the result the better prepared we will be to think of and apply the best decision making tools in our governments and our lives
9369839 ah meu o meu personal trainner disse que estou com os gl teos bem em forma e que nunca vou precisar de pl stica

9369844 this is the first real sign the tide is turning
9369845 if you are coming into university with not very good qualifications and do an arts degree at a low ranked university you are not really doing yourself any favours
9369846 having a workforce with graduate level skills has never been more important to economic success
9369847 there are also nonfinancial benefits for graduates who tend to have better jobs and healthier lifestyles be more involved in their childrens education and be more tolerant and active citizens
9369848 there are certainly young people who currently go to university who would have been better off on an advanced apprenticeship
9369849 we expect schools to be on top of the quality of teaching
9369850 i think there is still too much satisfactory teaching when you look at the attainment gap between the haves and have notes you are not going to get real success in those really difficult areas with satisfactory teaching it wasnt my phrase but satisfactory is not good enough especially in poor areas
9369851 sure we dont like you today well be over it tomorrow
9369852 choice of aim is clearly a matter of clarification of values especially on the choice between possible options
9369853 a recep o foi impressionante venho para dar o melhor estou aqui para ficar

9369857 ich betrachtete im mondlicht diese blasse stirn diese geschlossenen augen diese im winde zitternde haarstr hne und ich sagte mir was ich da sehe ist nur eine h lle das eigentliche ist unsichtbar

9369937 state senate president lyda green a republican who has often feuded with palin remarked shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9369938 im offended by barack obama saying that about my husband
9369939 my father had nothing he and my mother sold everything they had to raise 10 000
9369940 im proud of what my dad and my mother did and what they built and left me and i intend to carry their legacy as long as i can
9369941 as for your immediate support of the excuse it amazes me that you would dismiss the pregnancy allegations in the manner that you did
9369942 and then rush to support her on ethics abuse we dont know if that was the case for now all we know is power was abused
9369943 she is more of the same and if you talk to alaskans especially the alaskan press youll actually see what people think
9369944 why do you think the mccain campaign announced on a friday before the convention
9369945 thankfully we have obama who seems to be more diligent and thoughtful with his decision making a vp vetting committee working for several months assembling groups of experts together in common purpose and listening to them international trips to get the real word on the ground outlining exactly what policies we can expect to see with him as president etc this is the kind of deliberate judgment we need going forward
9369946 yes obama being the reasonable man that he is choose someone who would bring reinforcement to one of his weaker attributes experience biden has 36 years in the senate and the vice president is the president of the senate tiebreaker
9369947 so what exactly is wrong with being a woman and supporting a woman to become president
9369948 he was looking for someone who was well prepared to fight against international islamic extremism
9369949 the idea that women are going to race off to vote for any candidate with the same internal plumbing is both offensive and historically wrong
9369950 hillary clinton didn t run for president as a symbol but as the best prepared candidate in the democratic pack
9369951 if palin were a man would she have been selected by mccain

9369957 they aim at pushing georgians out of their villages to make sure they have no place to return to

9369959 we will not leave georgian houses orchards nothing we will erase them from the face of earth
9369960 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now no matter what we are republican or democratic america needs us to do what all americans have always done in times of disaster and challenge
9369961 shes had 12 years of elected office experience including traveling to kuwait including being involved in these issues
9369962 im so proud that she has displayed the kind of judgment and she has the experience and judgment as an executive

9369970 ele tocou a vida inteira o piaba de ouro um bloco tradicional pernambucano elevou muito as tradi es e teve o prazer de viver de sua arte assim como lia de itamarac e dona selma
9369971 salu foi muito respeitado por tudo o que ele fez e com certeza vai fazer muita falta ele era como um cone um ponto de refer ncia musical e filos fico
9369972 mestre salu foi muito importante em pernambuco porque ele foi um dos primeiros a estabelecer uma ponte entre a cultura da mata norte e os rg os do poder p blico
9369973 salu esteve presente nos anos 90 e fez um link com os m sicos da minha gera o e a de chico science
9369974 a aten o deveria estar toda na importante partida desta noite contra o la coru a esse crit rio foi completamente ignorado por robinho com seu pronunciamento poucas horas antes do jogo quanto aos coment rios de robinho o clube reitera o conte do de comunicados oficiais anteriores em que disse que n o teria outra escolha a n o ser aceitar um rompimento unilateral por parte do atleta se assim ele quiser
9369975 apesar de saber da rejei o do real madrid tranfer ncia do jogador continuou a fazer gestos e an ncios que chegaram ao pice com a venda de camisas do chelsea com o nome de robinho no site oficial do clube tudo isso complicou a situa o e confundiu o p blico
9369976 n o h nada errado em confirmar publicamente o interesse em um jogador quando o outro clube envolvido est totalmente ciente do fato recebeu duas propostas e est negociando a venda desse atleta portanto n s refutamos qualquer cr tica do real madrid
9369977 it was no more status quo no more politics as usual it was all about change so then to see that obama literally part of his campaign uses those themes even new energy change all that i think o k well we were a little bit ahead on that
9369978 somethings kind of changing here in alaska too for being such a red state on the presidential level
9369979 what is it exactly that the v p does every day
9369980 the g o p leader of the state we havent spoken since i got elected
9369981 i guess if you take the individual issues two that i believe would be benchmarks showing whether youre a hard core republican conservative or not would be im a lifetime member of the n r a but this is alaska who isnt and i am pro life absolutely
9369982 i guess that puts me in a box of being hard core republican
9369983 the democrats also preach individual freedoms and individual rights capitalism free market let it do its thing best let people keep as much of their money that they earn as possible and when it comes to like the party machine no one will accuse me of being partisan
9369984 turning maybe purple in the state means to me its more independent its not the obsessive partisanship that gets in the way of doing whats right for this state and i think on a national level thats what were gonna see
9369985 thats why mccain is the candidate for the g o p because hes been known as the maverick as the conduit for some change
9369986 i always looked at senator mccain just as a joe blow public member looking from the outside in
9369987 hes been buttin heads with republicans for years and thats a healthy place to be
9369988 im a mom and my son is going to get deployed in september and we better have a real clear plan for this war and it better not have to do with oil and dependence on foreign energy
9369989 ele chegou nesta madrugada dourados com a sa de normal depois do susto toda fam lia est a seu lado
9369990 foi meu sobrinho quem tomou a frente nas negocia es n o sei nem como foi feita a entrega do dinheiro
9369991 las partes desean alcanzar un acuerdo completo antes de que acabe 2008 y creen que es posible
9369992 pero como es imposible arreglar la cuesti n de jerusal n en ese plazo tienen que llegar a un acuerdo para aplazar la soluci n a este tema y acordar un mecanismo y un calendario para jerusal n
9369993 el objetivo sigue siendo llegar al final del proceso iniciado en la conferencia de annapolis en estados unidos del pasado noviembre y conseguir un acuerdo israelo palestino hist rico
9369994 decidido a lograr un acuerdo completo sobre todos los asuntos en debate pero ello depender de la seriedad israel
9369995 el factor tiempo no debe forzarnos a cometer graves errores
9369996 este gobierno no tiene el poder ni la legitimidad popular para alcanzar un acuerdo con los palestinos en especial sobre jerusal n
9369997 juntos sociedad y gobierno pondremos fin a este c ncer que da a lastima a nuestro m xico
9369998 es tarea urgente que todas las autoridades y todos los ciudadanos hagamos la parte que nos corresponde para limpiar a m xico de la delincuencia
9369999 el gobierno federal refrenda su compromiso con la ciudadan a y redoblar esfuerzos para erradicar este mal
