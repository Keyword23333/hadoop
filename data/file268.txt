2680001 okej i redaktionell text p din blogg som vi nu inser inte r kommersiell
2680002 ich wollte 4 03 schwimmen aber um ehrlich zu sein ich habe mich nicht so gut gef hlt
2680003 nachher aber habe ich aufgeschaut und gesehen dass pr sident bush den daumen nach oben und die us flagge hoch gehalten hat das war ziemlich cool
2680004 ich bin aufgeregt das war wirklich ein guter beginn f r mich
2680005 ich habe bob anm sein trainer bob bowman gesagt dass das meine letzten 400 m lagen sein w rden also musste ich da raus gehen und eine gute zeit schwimmen und das war eine gute zeit
2680006 das n chste mal m chte ich ihn aber erwischen
2680007 ich habe gesehen dass ryan langsamer wurde also habe ich alles gegeben um an ihm vorbeizugehen
2680008 ich dachte es w re eine 4 31 dass es eine 4 29 wurde habe ich noch nicht realisiert
2680009 es ist nicht meine fitness daran habe ich gearbeitet es ist die fehlende geschwindigkeit
2680010 im just excited to be among the best in the world and to race my best
2680011 its going to take a lot of hard work from everyone on the team
2680012 that win at sonoma wasnt easy at all once the green flag falls youve just got to stick to your strategy and hope everything works out in your favour
2680013 you go out there and run as hard as you can to see what youve got
2680014 whether we win or whether we run out of gas just doesnt matter at this point weve got to win
2680015 its important especially for the first two or three races of the chase when everybody is so worried about the points and where youre at
2680016 it really buys you some sleep and peace of mind at the start of the chase
2680017 weve got to get at least two weeks in a row to get good finishes to solidify our place its not like were getting caught up in wrecks its just dumb stuff that we get caught up in were inconsistent right now we run top 10 and then run in the 40s
2680018 right now i feel like theres five races left we can have no more than two bad races
2680019 if we finish 25th or worse were going to have to have some help
2680020 as an activist i think i probably made my legacy because now women are competing in trap and skeet
2680021 i think this increased the opportunities for women and participation of women hopefully that will go on for generations
2680022 as long as you have your passion age does not matter
2680023 shooting is a big part of my life i love to compete
2680024 ill shoot for sure for another year and then it will be 40 years that i have competed at a world level after that i may still shoot or i may turn to coaching
2680025 we are in a tough pool and we will be happy to finish in the top eight
2680026 the past 11 months for me have been hard and the biggest challenge of my life
2680027 it felt phenomenal to be out there competing because i know i worked my ass off to earn my spot on that team its been my everything for 11 months
2680028 i just really wanted to show this team is here to compete
2680029 were going to come out here with undying canadian pride and honour were just going to throw it down
2680030 playing that well with the crowd behind china quieting them its a great feeling
2680031 they seemed very unaffected by the crowd they seemed to feed off the energy in the stands and it didnt bother them at all
2680032 i think this was one of the better performances i have seen from a focused effort from tactical discipline from goal scoring chances consistency and also we seemed to be by far the fitter team out there and that surprised me a little bit
2680033 it was like nothing ive never experienced and it was eye opening to our team to see that because its going to be like this more and more as we progress through the tournament
2680034 we did a great job we didnt listen to the crowd we talked to each other on the field
2680035 we were driving to the stadium today and were like oh look the sun and it was this faint little yellow dot in the sky obviously the conditions arent ideal but i think whats harder to play in is the heat and humidity its not the smog that gets to you its the fact that youre drenched by the end of the game
2680036 everyone was absolutely exhausted theyre exhausted were exhausted wed attack and there was no midfield and then theyd attack just leaving everything out on the field trying for that last goal
2680037 they had some chances we had some chances it got to the point where ref just blow the whistle let it end
2680038 ive been out of the hospital for about a week now
2680039 im on heavy antibiotics to get rid of the stomach infection so ill now in probably two weeks when i go back in for a cat scan whether the antibiotics have been able to get rid of the infection if they have obviously thats great news
2680040 i went downhill pretty fast in kingston after they took me off some antibiotics and put me back on food i didnt react very well and from there i developed the infection thats the main focus of what theyre trying to deal with
2680041 its not a big deal with paddy and doug there but my intention would be to be back maybe thats a little anxious or overzealous if i need the surgery i still think i would be back in time i just might not be on the ice with the guys right away while i recover
2680042 as i get a little stronger ill be able to go in a little bit more
2680043 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2680044 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2680045 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2680046 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2680047 i guess the course is going to change quite a bit
2680048 its still going to be playing difficult but probably not to the extreme it was playing the last couple of days
2680049 hai orang orang yang beriman apabila diseru untuk menunaikan shalat pada hari jumat maka bersegeralah kamu kepada mengingat allah dan tinggalkanlah jual beli yang demikian itu lebih baik bagimu jika kamu mengetahui apabila telah ditunaikan shalat maka bertebaranlah kamu di muka bumi dan carilah karunia allah dan ingatlah allah banyak banyak supaya kamu beruntung
2680050 dan bagi masing masing mereka derajat menurut apa yang meraka kerjakan dan agar allah mencukupkan bagi mereka balasan pekerjaan pekerjaan mereka sadangkan mereka tidak dirugikan
2680051 dan barang siapa datang kepada tuhannya dalam keadaan beriman lagi bersungguh sungguh telah beramal shalilh maka mereka itulah orang orang yang memperoleh derajat yang tinggi
2680052 sesungguhnya orang orang yang beriman dan beramal yang baik mereka itu adalah sebaik baiknya makhluk
2680053 maka adapun orang orang yang beriman dan baramal yang baik akan dimasukkan allah ke dalam rahmat nya yang demikian itu adalah kejayaan yang nyata
2680054 dan orang orang yang beriman kepada allah serta beramal shalih niscaya allah akan menghapuskan dosa dosa mereka
2680055 dan allah telah berjanji kepada orang orang yang beriman dan beramal shalilh untuk mengampuni mereka dan memberi mereka ganjaran yang besar
2680056 dan itulah surga yang akan diberikan kepadamu karena karya karya yang telah kamu kerjakan
2680057 dia allah telah menciptakan kamu dari bumi tanah dan meminta kepada kamu untuk memakmurkannya
2680058 dan janganlah kamu membuat kerusakkan di muka bumi sesudah tuhan memperbaikinya
2680059 tidakkah kamu perhatikan bahwa allah telah menyerahkan kepada kamu apa saja yang ada di langit dan apa saja yang ada di bumi dan dia telah menyempurnakan untuk kamu nikmat nikmat nya baik yang lahir maupun yang batin
2680060 survei itu kan bukan tuhan tidak sepenuhnya benar tapi saya menilai itu sah sah saja sebagai bagian dari sistem demokrasi
2680061 i had my first open mic in august the next month after that i met my manager the next month after that my label was at the gig
2680062 put your music into a format people can relate to get out there with your instrument and just do your thing
2680063 oro valley police officers noticed an alarming trend more and more of the addicts they encountered were teens and young adults hooked on heroin
2680064 in the wake of oregons crackdown on methamphetamine police say heroin has become a cheaper more plentiful alternative
2680065 heroin is among several narcotic opiates including some prescription drugs that seem to be rising in popularity
2680066 no one starts off saying i want to be a heroin addict
2680067 these kids might be at a party and someone convinces them to try it
2680068 one of the reasons cited for the surge in heroin use is its relatively cheap cost
2680069 its very easy for someone to go from a ten dollar chance at escape to a 400 a day habit
2680070 unfortunately because it can be snorted kids think the stigma of being a drug addict is removed
2680071 theres not the same stigma as when a hard core drug user injects it
2680072 most heroin users i knew didnt hit rock bottom until after they started using
2680073 i sat at her wake and what broke my heart was that so many confident parents walked up to me and ive seen their kids with my daughter and if they were with my daughter they shouldnt be so confident
2680074 i said many times we are one body short in midfield and if you ask me who i cannot answer the question because i dont know more than you
2680075 we missed nasri tonight who has a little knock we missed diaby and we missed song whos at the olympics
2680076 i dont know if our midfield tonight was ideal but its certainly not far from the midfield well play on wednesday night
2680077 im not concerned about that but i would have been very concerned tonight if we had one or two injuries in midfield
2680078 we cant afford that at the moment with nasri and diaby out its very positive for us that we have no injuries tonight
2680079 im not too much concerned about the defence because i think we played against a good attack as long as we score more
2680080 we were not well positioned on the pitch thats why we were sometimes in trouble
2680081 kolo is ok its his first game since he had malaria and i felt in the second half he was much better than in the first
2680082 its an amazing achievement it hasnt really kicked in yet ive really given it my all
2680083 i was really focused on my own race i wasnt really thinking about the end of the race
2680084 to be honest i didnt really feel that great before the race
2680085 going into the ready room i started getting chills on my body i knew i was starting to get more and more excited i was pretty emotional after that race im pretty excited to get that first one under my belt
2680086 seeing everyone so close together after the first 200m that is not how it is after the first 200m its normally the 300m mark so i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger then coming home on freestyle is always adrenalin
2680087 i guess you can say i went out too fast i knew i had to get out fast
2680088 i guess it wasnt what i was looking for it would have been nice to be on the medal podium
2680089 making it into the final was the only thing i was after so ive achieved that i went faster than last night and thats always a good sign
2680090 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2680091 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2680092 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2680093 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2680094 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2680095 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2680096 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2680097 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2680098 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2680099 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2680100 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2680101 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2680102 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2680103 advertisers are really only interested in women as their consumers meaning they really dont care if men buy their food or not
2680104 all their messages even if they feature a man are still directed towards women towards motivating women to believe that this is the job they should do to feed their men and women and if they dont do it they are unloving alternatively they flatter her skills as a homemaker and prey on her insecurities suggesting using their products will give women sexual allure a happy marriage and healthy kids
2680105 research supports the premise that the majority of domestic tasks are still undertaken by women
2680106 advertising is not a social pioneering phenomenon it works by being a mirror to the way things are even if people sometimes wish it was different
2680107 most advertising is mainly about getting on with the day to day grind you dont go to advertising for inspiration it would be commercially risky for an ad campaign to position itself ahead of change
2680108 if i still have to worry about my weight and body image when i get to heaven im not going
2680109 not because i have to but because i want to
2680110 stop what youre doing and step away from any sharp objects
2680111 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2680112 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2680113 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2680114 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2680115 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2680116 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2680117 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2680118 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2680119 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2680120 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2680121 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2680122 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2680123 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2680124 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2680125 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2680126 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2680127 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2680128 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2680129 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2680130 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2680131 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2680132 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2680133 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2680134 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2680135 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2680136 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2680137 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2680138 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2680139 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2680140 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2680141 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2680142 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2680143 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2680144 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2680145 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2680146 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2680147 man developed many things and became so advanced that it lost its own roots
2680148 a strategy of low carbon economy had been adopted 12 13 years back by state government
2680149 with the launching of organic farming along with a green mission and now the world is following it
2680150 you people should avoid such anti people elements who blackmail you by exploiting your emotion
2680151 the three day festival includes something for everyone with concerts ceilidhs outdoor events and sessions across durham with a wealth of talent drawn from the folkworks summer schools and beyond
2680152 we are travelling without a political religious or social agenda
2680153 the whole thing started nearly four years ago as students at cambridge there was a bunch of us wanting to do this journey and write a book about it
2680154 then a producer became involved and the idea of a television series came about it is going really well and is proving to be a real experience
2680155 if it was found that government officials were hiring private vehicles the gjm would chase the vehicles carrying government officials and ask them to change the number plate to gl
2680156 we have also asked the private vehicle owners to change the number plates but it was not not mandatory
2680157 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2680158 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2680159 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2680160 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2680161 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2680162 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2680163 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2680164 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2680165 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2680166 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2680167 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2680168 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2680169 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2680170 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2680171 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2680172 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2680173 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2680174 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2680175 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2680176 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2680177 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2680178 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2680179 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2680180 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2680181 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2680182 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2680183 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2680184 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2680185 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2680186 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2680187 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2680188 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2680189 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2680190 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2680191 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2680192 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2680193 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2680194 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2680195 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2680196 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2680197 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2680198 who are open to doing something on the production side
2680199 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2680200 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2680201 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2680202 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2680203 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2680204 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

2680209 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2680210 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2680211 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2680212 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2680213 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2680214 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2680215 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2680216 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2680217 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province brigadier dawson said
2680218 shadow governor responsible for authorising bomb attacks across the province
2680219 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan brigadier dawson said
2680220 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province brigadier dawson said
2680221 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12 people

2680239 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2680240 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2680241 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2680242 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2680243 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2680244 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2680245 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2680246 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2680247 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2680248 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2680249 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2680250 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2680251 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2680252 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2680253 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2680254 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2680255 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2680256 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2680257 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2680258 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2680259 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2680260 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2680261 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

2680266 how many times do you get to tell your kids and grandkids you played in the olympics
2680267 georgian forces have temporarily left tskhinvali as part of a tactical manoeuvre they are in positions on the outskirts of tskhinvali
2680268 there have been eyewitness reports that georgian troop columns have been moving out of tskhinvali and moving back into georgian territory
2680269 five people have been injured in what appears to be a russian air raid
2680270 when you speak to people here they have no idea why this place would be targeted while there are military parts housed here it is not a military base some say that perhaps there may have been confusion on the russian side
2680271 fired on tskhinvali methodically all night but for now a relative calm has settled in the city
2680272 the city is almost fully destroyed civilians left in the city are hiding in bomb shelters and basements
2680273 the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2680274 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on non use of force with south ossetians
2680275 russian planes have not stopped bombing the kodori gorge since yesterday and now they are also bombing zugdidi
2680276 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2680277 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2680278 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2680279 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2680280 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2680281 this continuation of their participation very much reflects the olympic spirit and the values of the games
2680282 the ioc believes this is absolutely the right decision most of all for the athletes who have trained so hard and for whom this a once in a lifetime possibly opportunity
2680283 theyve confirmed their participation very much in the light of respect friendship athlete to athlete so we have no reason to have any concerns on that today with regards to any other measures to be taken we dont at this time have any reason to believe thats necessary
2680284 its very difficult for us georgians because of everything thats going on at home
2680285 it was nice that natalia paderina came up to me after and gave me a handshake
2680286 participation in the olympic games athlete to athlete is under the spirit of respect and fair play
2680287 should it be confirmed that there was someone refusing on that basis this would be something the ioc would take seriously but this particular case that you raise hasnt been brought to our attention
2680288 if the shock of the lightning sounds instant and compelling its because it was written and recorded dead fast
2680289 its basically a demo and has retained its energy theres a lot to be said for that the first time you record something is always the best
2680290 on the album i wanted a sound that was more hypnotic more driving songs you would maybe have to connect to to feel

2680292 if he could be bothered to finish some of the songs he started theyre amazing
2680293 it black money is as its name suggests tainted money money which is not clean or which has a stigma attached to it black is a color which is generally associated with evil while it symbolizes something which violates normal social or legal norms it also suggests a veil of secrecy shrouding it the term black money consequently has both these implications it not only stands for money earned by violating legal provisions even social conscience but also suggests that such money is kept secret and not accounted for today concealed income and or undisclosed wealth as well as money involved in transactions wholly or partly suppressed
2680294 it existed for thousands of years it was only with the advent of sewers and fast moving vehicles horses and trolleys and cars where you start seeing curbs and really defining where uses go
2680295 weve extended that curb 10 feet out were forcing drivers to pay attention and were forcing them to slow down even just a little bit because their field of vision has changed
2680296 one of the pieces that monderman talked about is that you have to give responsibility back to the drivers and pedestrians to behave rationally
2680297 if you treat drivers like idiots they act as idiots
2680298 when you walk down one of these european streets and see people walking entire families riding bicycles together people sitting outside having an evening drink you think this is the way a city should be
2680299 and you feel astounded that america hasnt caught on to that effect
2680300 if you manage peoples expectations for the duration of the queue people will behave
2680301 when you ride the subway in london theres a little display that tells you how long until the next train arrives
2680302 most of the time its safe if youre a rational person thats when people jaywalk but a car can come out of a driveway and thats when trouble happens
2680303 we have these clocks that show you how much time you have to cross the street until youre in grave danger
2680304 look at this guy right here in the suit boom desire line
2680305 he went on a straight beeline from the train to canal street hes trying to get to the financial district and psychologically he thinks the fastest way to cross is diagonally at the middle of the block thats his desire line but you cant always put a crosswalk where that desire line is because it might not be safe you have to look at pedestrian mentality and then balance it against other modes of transportation
2680306 to get pedestrians to take the extra four seconds to walk to the crosswalk
2680307 we live in an environment where everybody is in a rush
2680308 our job is to look at it as if everybody plays by the rules how best to move everybody through the system it would always baffle me to drive through the financial district and see someone who just closed a billion dollar deal walking through the cars without looking
2680309 transportation commissioners of the past have always been about move the car move the car the world is so different now its cars and bikes and wheelchairs
2680310 push buttons are stupid because cars dont have to push a button
2680311 bicyclists and pedestrians are not fighting for space in the system he says theyre fighting for scraps
2680312 when the system is laid out such that it works for everybody people will behave if a pedestrian has to push a button the system isnt working
2680313 part of the problem is that the study of traffic engineering is so numerical its easy to quantify but how do you value something like a bike lane when you start talking about value thats when it becomes sticky
2680314 its more of an art than a science which makes it difficult for people to handle because they want numbers they want proof

2680316 jan is al 22 jaar mijn buurjongen ik ken hem al zijn hele leven naast visboer ben ik ook voetbal en schaatstrainer en zodoende sporten jan en ik geregeld samen laatst waren we aan het skeeleren toen ik hem vroeg of het klopte dat zijn stemgeluid wat hoger was geworden de laatste tijd dat klopt bevestigde hij waarop ik beweerde dat hij toch vast nog niet zo hoog kon zingen als ik bij thuiskomst vertelde jan dat aan yolanthe die spontaan riep dat ze me zou komen helpen in mijn kraam als ik jan zou verslaan en zo geschiedde
2680317 ze konden er wel om lachen yolanthe wilde graag komen helpen en jan komt gezellig mee inmiddels hebben we de planning zover dat ze f de 23e f de 30e naar raamsdonksveer komen daar sta ik op zaterdag altijd met mijn viskraam de precieze datum hangt af van de agenda van jan
2680318 het is gewoon leuk daar doen we het voor ze komen geen hele dag natuurlijk maar dat hoeft ook niet ik denk dat ze een uurtje blijven maar dat is prima hoe laat precies is nog niet bekend ik verwacht rond een uur of n

2680327 obama has criticized bush for his fiscal irresponsibility and now hes using bushs baseline as a yardstick by which to measure fiscal responsibility
2680328 congress hasnt agreed to extend the bush tax cuts because they dont have the money to pay for it
2680329 its not unreasonable to say were inheriting a budget thats going to have substantial deficits into the future
2680330 said a democratic congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity so he could speak candidly
2680331 leaving some of the tax cuts in place would cost us a small fortune
2680332 i dont know that any blue dog has a good way to pay for that
2680333 president bush created this problem we would put in place rules so it never happens again
2680334 but a sound budget is based on making realistic promises and sticking to them
2680335 das konzept des damals noch nicht fertig gestellten burj al arab als das luxuri seste hotel der welt hat mich sehr gereizt
2680336 1999 habe ich in der hotellerie in london gearbeitet und einer meiner engsten freunde hat london damals verlassen um in dubai den bereich information technology f r eine neue und wachsende hotelgruppe aufzubauen und f r mich war es zeit f r eine neue berufliche herausforderung nachdem ich nach dem abitur in deutschland in london business amp finance studiert und vier jahre in der hotellerie gearbeitet hatte
2680337 zu diesem zeitpunkt wusste ich mit dubai nicht viel anzufangen aber das konzept des damals noch nicht fertig gestellten burj al arab als das luxuri seste hotel der welt hat mich sehr gereizt

2680340 he might look innocent but hes a proper little blighter that one is if he was a human he would a criminal
2680341 right now my hairy friend im taking you out for a very special treat
2680342 now just stand back and watch what he does if he finds it hell get a banana
2680343 give me the diamonds and ill give you the banana thats a good swap now isnt it
2680344 its just like a i thought you cant trust a monkey to keep a deal
2680345 there i told you this monkey could do the business
2680346 i expect that they are taking me to play that game again i bet that this time ill have to compete against some other monkeys and if i win the prize will be even bigger and even tastier yummeee
2680347 now theo you want a chocie banana dont you well you see that open window up there all you have to do is to climb up the drainpipe and in through that window and find something nice and shiny like you did before bring it back to us and well do a swap with you
2680348 i bet these are worth a whole crate of chocolate bananas
2680349 i fear that mr grabber and his friends are up to no good in the human world bananas are cheap and diamonds are expensive
2680350 in the monkey world bananas are beautiful and diamonds are useless so it is a good swap for me
2680351 and you must not forget too that it is wrong to steal the owner of the diamonds will be very sad to lose her beautiful things
2680352 i told you to check that the windows were closed before we left and the blighters even ate my chocolates look at my curtain and the bed clothes they are covered in strange chocolaty marks like like paw prints and see these thick black hairs on my pillow disgusting
2680353 we have reason to believe that one of your monkeys has broken into a house and stolen some valuables including diamonds and chocolates
2680354 we checked our files and the name of one of your monkeys came up young theodore seems like he has form he was nicked last year for stealing chocolate
2680355 i cant say will be too sad to see the back of him
2680356 if there is right and wrong in the world how come mr grabber has bought himself new sports car and the lady is still missing her jewels and is very sad about what happened why didnt the police find out that it was mr grabber who stole the jewels
2680357 that is indeed the hardest question of all to answer even after one has lived and seen the world for many a long year i too often wonder why it is that bad people get away with doing wrong things but believe me young monkey this story is not yet at an end one day mr grabber will grow too bold with his success at wrong doing and then he will be caught
2680358 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2680359 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2680364 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2680365 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2680593 why do limited partners continue to flock to the asset class
2680594 heres where it gets dicey for the masses though and ill make some gross simplifying assumptions if youre an lp and investing in an run of the mill 500 million fund hoping to get a 3x net return that fund has to generate 1 75 billion in returns 1 25b in profit less 20 carry equals two turns of profit of course thats just the capital that accrues to the firms ownership stake since a lot of firms end up owning only 10 15 of their companies at exit youve typically got to gross the 1 75 billion up by a factor of between 6 67 and 10 that suggests that those firms need to create between 12 and 17 billion of market cap just to get a 3x fund level net return to their lps caliente lets unpack that box a bit more at the 15 billion midpoint of the exit range above a firm that invests in 25 early stage companies will have to get on average 600 million exit valuations for each and every one of them thats a pretty daunting number when you consider that the typical m amp a valuation has hovered in the high double digit millions for quite some time

2680596 we used to think that chronic kidney disease was just an issue of getting older
2680597 but when we took age out of the equation we found that kidney disease can affect even young adults
2680598 the vast majority of these people were in the prime of their life
2680599 this is a call to action that americans need to improve their health

2680603 we are best at discriminating the facial features that are typical of our neighbors and if they happen to be parrots we become very good at recognizing individual birds
2680604 ultimately we are interested in what happens in a natural environment
2680605 but some questions require more control over the properties of visual stimuli than a picture of a natural scene would allow
2680606 the response of individual neurons can be strongly influenced by simple stimuli in the surround of the receptive field a phenomenon known as contextual modulation
2680607 context is an important part of how we perceive visual stimuli
2680608 and these results show how individual neurons might adjust their properties in different natural environments such as on a beach or in a forest
2680609 this is an excellent opportunity to learn and practice these new behaviors in a virtual environment and in real life
2680610 its also a great place to meet other avatars and share information and experiences
2680611 we hope to develop multi national collaborations in sl to increase awareness knowledge skills and support for healthy living

2680613 living with diabetes creates an opportunity to take a challenge and turn it into something positive
2680614 this resource will help healthcare professionals lead people with diabetes on a journey to becoming confident and empowered about diabetes management
2680615 we received over 10 000 requests last year for the 7 habits of highly effective people with diabetes booklet indicating the strong demand for us to create additional resources
2680616 with dr coveys help we have designed this new guide to provide a valuable tool that addresses the challenges that healthcare professionals and people with diabetes face in managing the disease we are always looking for innovative partners like fit4d who share our commitment to simplifying life with diabetes and look forward to collaborating with them on upcoming efforts
2680617 we could not be more excited about our partnership with bayer diabetes care
2680618 bayer is a company with a strong commitment to the diabetes community and fit4d is honored to help them spread the message about the importance of diet and exercise in the successful management of diabetes
2680619 the classic example of a fingerprint is an ink imprint showing the unique swirls and loops used for identification but fingerprints also leave behind a unique distribution of molecular compounds
2680620 some of the residues left behind are from naturally occurring compounds in the skin and some are from other surfaces or materials a person has touched
2680621 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
2680622 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint the image could then be used with fingerprint recognition software to identify an individual
2680623 i saw how parthiv was hit on his nose during the third and final test against sri lanka it was surprising to see him without a helmet maybe he was confident but parthiv was fortunate to have hit on the nose
2680624 the ball came off the pad and him hard but my injury was very serious im glad that parthiv could come and keep again he needs to put on some ice and he would be fine
2680625 in modern days cricket a helmet is a must i had told him parthiv during the camp in fact i had quoted my example how the injury to my right eye ended my career
2680626 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
2680627 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2680628 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
2680629 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
2680630 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2680631 congress as the major party in the upa has to take a call on the leadership issue it should decide and discuss with the allies but if we want someone who is non controversial then manmohan singh is there

2680640 we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kak will only talk about that when they do a deal he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea
2680641 normally milan do not sell their best players we think they like the proposal but it is not so easy for them to accept it for now we must just wait and see
2680642 living through the war was really hard its a shocking experience when you live without energy without water without food

2680688 the lack of public on the roadside is a concern we share and we had discussed it with the organising committee before the games started
2680689 the subject was even raised at an ioc meeting this morning
2680690 im on the womens race right now and there are huge crowds in the city itself like there were yesterday with the men
2680691 but it all changes when we reach the final circuit and the roads have been closed to the public
2680692 we did not expect huge crowds like in the mountain stages of the tour de france but certainly people should have more access to the circuit
2680693 we have asked the organising committee to take measures to improve the situation and were confident it will improve by wednesday for the time trial
2680694 every olympic event like the beach volleyball yesterday deserves a full house i was very surprised
2680695 as a tradition sponsors and media have seats reserved at the preliminaries sometimes they may come up
2680696 also some sports they have one ticket for the whole morning or evening

2680730 it was sort of cool because i actually grew up shy by nature

2680754 sejak tahun 1998 kegiatan plg tidak lagi mendapat perhatian pemerintah pusat sehingga plg ini menjadi lahan sejuta sengsara bila musim hujan tiba akan terjadi musibah banjir dan bila musim kemarau tiba akan terjadi musibah kebakaran

2680819 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2680820 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2680821 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2680822 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2680823 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2680824 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2680825 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2680845 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2680846 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2680847 openly saying we are ready for a cease fire and withdrawal of forces
2680848 their version of a cease fire is for the other side to withdraw
2680849 we had to decide are we a state or are we not a state

2680877 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2680878 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2680879 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation
2680880 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2680881 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2680882 he was one of those comics that was unique because of his approach his look his voice and the content of his material
2680883 bernie fell into that category of people who were inherently different like when you saw them you knew they were different and when they spoke you knew they were different
2680884 as comics were all brothers and ill miss him a lot he was a good friend of mine
2680885 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
2680886 when i showed up to work he said something to me that had never been said to me on a set before
2680887 he said baby girl the script here is not the bible do you and ill follow i got mine you get yours when he said that i knew everything was going to be all right i was happy to have the freedom to make up some funny with him it was simply delicious

2680901 we won some games that we played well in and we won some games where we didnt do so well
2680902 we understand we could have played better we know that once we move the ball on offense and all play together then were an unbelievable team when we dont we become just as good as anyone else thats the most important thing we figured out
2680903 teams are not in awe of us as much as they were with the dream team
2680904 theyve seen us they know us they want to play us they feel they can beat us and thats ok we have to get it done
2680905 thats the point were trying to get across if we can run offense like were playing against ourselves thats much better
2680906 all these guys would rather play in big games theyre ready to play olympic basketball games for the u s

2680908 the north koreans dont like to hear the term human rights but that does not mean that we shouldnt raise it
2680909 is abysmal and every day that the people of north korea continue to suffer represents an unacceptable continuation of oppression

2680912 generally speaking in colorado the markets are relatively flat to declining slightly particularly in april may and june
2680913 its the economy slowing down oil and gas prices going up and a feeling of economic uncertainty among people
2680914 it does seem like its down over the whole state but it does not shock me that greeley is growing that much
2680915 its just been the trend weve seen since weve been opened i think theres a lot more business there than any of us really anticipated
2680916 people are so loyal to the hilton brand and the hampton inn is the first hilton product into the greeley market
2680917 maybe people who would have normally stayed in loveland because of a hilton product there perhaps theyve come to stay in greeley its due in part to the hilton central reservation system
2680918 as ive talked with lodgers month by month theyve noticed an increase in their business activity
2680919 we went to a lot of trouble to get this deal done and we structured it in a way where there is very little chance that we ever get these c d o s back or take the same risk back
2680920 we would not have needed to raise more capital unless we completed the c d o sale
2680921 i aint ashamed that i said it and aint nobody gonna make me take it back
2680922 sometimes when you win you lose sometimes when you lose you win
2680923 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2680924 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2680925 people dont give comedians credit for being great actors but were the best
2680926 comedians are great actors because of their imaginations they know how to go into character and hold the audiences attention
2680927 i can put my own shoes on can you tell ivan to saddle sky and bring her around
2680928 you know im going to tell him to put on a side saddle

2680931 she had to let me come dessika i told her yesterday we were going to wessils because you ladies were missing my birthday
2680932 why do you always choose the table in the back it makes us look suspicious
2680933 shalie i know youre shy but you can at least say hello
2680934 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2680935 we thought it would be better for him to get on the bus because its a far drive
2680936 now he keeps saying that he should have driven himself
2680937 we think we are misperceived they invented that term whole paycheck and they continue to repeat it
2680938 so were endeavoring to educate our customers through our value tours through our education and signage in the stores through our merchandising to make sure that our customers understand the compelling values that whole foods already has

2680949 we dont censor our speakers or tell them what they should say particularly as a journalism organization i appreciate the point he was trying to make but could his speech have been in better taste i would say so
2680950 upon reflection it was a tasteless remark that i now bitterly regret
2680951 i am grateful to you for the opportunity to address those present and hope that the continuing work of the organization will not be harmed or undermined by my moment of stupidity
2680952 this kind of remark has no place in any setting and martin knows that and is truly sorry for his serious error in judgment
2680953 consider how liberal government authorities like mayor gavin newsom have corrupted the men in blue by stipulating that police not prosecute public nudity and indecency at homosexual festivals
2680954 what honor can there be in protecting the public practice of heinous perversions and nudity in the citys streets the shame of pandering politicians is transferred to the cops who were intended to be guardians of the law and public order
2680955 walked around baring their genitals with no fear of being arrested
2680956 one of the citys two open air celebrations of sadomasochism euphemistically called the leather lifestyle by practitioners
2680957 it is telling to us that the same city whose mayor gavin newsom d ignited the same sex marriage crusade in california by illegally issuing gay marriage licenses openly tolerates and celebrates gross perversions nudity and sexual lawlessness on its streets
2680958 ill go even further and call the images depraved and disgusting
2680959 remember this is on the public streets of san francisco
2680960 these photos do not fit in with the slick national gay marketing plan to be sure
2680961 nevertheless the pathetic and debased spectacle is as much an offspring of the glbt movement as the current quest for homosexual marriage the latter radically redefines and corrupts an ancient institution created by god to order relations between man and woman as the basis for family life perverse events like up your alley mock any notion of right and wrong as the reckless pursuit of anything goes tolerance leads governmental authorities to enable and promote evil turning freedom into sexual anarchy while causing a breakdown in law and order
2680962 one san francisco policeman told our volunteers that the police were instructed not to make arrests for indecency on the city streets at
2680963 san franciscos extreme political correctness has turned cops into impotent perversion protectors
2680964 homosexual activists mock and deride americans for truth relentlessly for exposing sordid realities like up your alley and showing you what happens when sexual radicals come to dominate a major city
2680965 they dont want americans to see this side of their agenda but we must face reality and come to grips with the truth that rights based on aberrant sex are not genuine civil rights
2680966 this type of painting is about 1 thousand years old one of chinas oldest art forms
2680967 for the life of me i cant image that being a proportionate response to the charge that georgia has attacked russian peacekeepers
2680968 its hard for us to understand what russias plan is here
2680969 i do sense an emerging unified view among our key allies
2680970 towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict
2680971 we think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction
2680972 the next thing i know were at his apartment still talking its like were a dialogue machine or something i tell him about my old boyfriends and that ive slept with thirty six guys and i go how about you
2680973 it was about seven oclock and i hadnt had any breakfast
2680974 id eaten about half of it when there was a nasty crunch at my back teeth i spat it out and when i realised what it was i was physically sick out the van although my mate thought it was hilarious
2680975 it appears that the object came in with a delivery of fresh mushrooms and had not been removed by our rigorous washing process which is an extremely rare occurrence
2680976 when i first asked for help at the va i got kind of a bad attitude from one person so i ended up leaving and not registering
2680977 the resident homoeopath katie jermine quizzed me about my diet stress levels and lifestyle she then strapped on a wristband and plugged me into an electronic device called the quantum qxci which scanned my system for vitamins minerals food intolerances toxicity organ function hormone balance parasites digestive disorders and stress levels
2680978 the most advanced medical assessment and therapy device in the world today
2680979 then i started getting these kinds of chills on my body right then and there i knew i was starting to get more and more excited

2680982 remember its a long time until we play a game that counts
2680983 it wasnt by design for him to have so few attempts but we knew he was not going to play very much hell play more next week so hell throw more in general
2680984 the situation of the game coach felt like that was enough for me
2680985 i dont know yet that we can all of a sudden be a pass heavy team and throw the ball all over the place
2680986 theres no part of me right now that could tell you we would be able to change right now from where we were last year
2680987 anytime someone plays that well especially at that position it builds your confidence in him

2680992 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2680993 it was what was to be expected it was hot and humid it was a little like iowa you can see in iowa though
2680994 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
2680995 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
2680996 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
2680997 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines

2681023 let me ask you tim a rhetorical question he cheney sat on your program in the fall before the war and said saddam hussein has reconstituted his nuclear weapons i simultaneously said there is simply no evidence to sustain that none zero none i said it then i said it again i say it now i demand anyone put forward for me classified or in any other form any evidence to sustain the assertion the vice president of the united states made that saddam hussein said to tim russert he saddam has reconstituted his nuclear weapons that is a flat misrepresentation of the facts

2681047 he aqu no pod is tener ventanas pues ser an hechas pedazos ni llevar is fuego con vosotros porque no os dirigir is por la luz del fuego
2681048 pues he aqu ser is como una ballena en medio del mar porque las inmensas olas estallar n contra vosotros
2681049 por tanto qu deseas que prepare para vosotros a fin de que teng is luz cuando se is sumergidos en las profundidades del mar
2681050 he aqu oh se or no te enojes con tu siervo a causa de su debilidad delante de ti oh se or ten piedad de m y aparta tu ira de este pueblo y no permitas que atraviese este furioso abismo en la obscuridad sino mira estas cosas que he fundido de la roca
2681051 y s oh se or que t tienes todo poder y que puedes hacer cuanto quieras para el beneficio del hombre
2681052 he aqu oh se or t puedes hacer esto sabemos que puedes manifestar gran poder que parece peque o al entendimiento de los hombres
2681053 he aqu oh se or estoy seguro de que puedes hacer esto
2681054 he aqu oh se or t has hecho muchas cosas mayores que sta
2681055 fue quitado el velo de ante los ojos del hermano de jared y vio el dedo del se or y era como el dedo de un hombre a semejanza de carne y sangre y el hermano de jared cay delante del se or porque fue herido de temor
2681056 vi el dedo del se or y tuve miedo de que me hiriese porque no sab a que el se or tuviese carne y sangre
2681057 a causa de tu fe has visto que tomar sobre m carne y sangre y jam s ha venido a m hombre alguno con tan grande fe como la que t tienes porque de no haber sido as no hubieras podido ver mi dedo viste m s que esto
2681058 he aqu yo soy el que fue preparado desde la fundaci n del mundo para redimir a mi pueblo
2681059 y nunca me he mostrado al hombre a quien he creado porque jam s ha cre do en m el hombre como t lo has hecho ves que eres creado a mi propia imagen s en el principio todos los hombres fueron creados a mi propia imagen
2681060 he aqu este cuerpo que ves ahora es el cuerpo de mi esp ritu y he creado al hombre a semejanza del cuerpo de mi esp ritu y as como me aparezco a ti en esp ritu aparecer a mi pueblo en la carne
2681061 sabe todas las cosas y no existe nada sin que l lo sepa
2681062 y jam s ha venido a m hombre alguno con tan grande fe como la que t tienes porque de no haber sido as no hubieras podido ver mi dedo
2681063 y nunca me he mostrado al hombre a quien he creado porque jam s ha cre do en m el hombre como t lo has hecho
2681064 al resto de los de su posteridad que eran justos
2681065 y vi al se or y estaba ante mi faz y habl conmigo as como un hombre habla con otro cara a cara
2681066 y nunca me he mostrado como jesucristo al hombre a quien he creado
2681067 por lo que teniendo este conocimiento perfecto de dios fue imposible impedirle ver dentro del velo por tanto vio a jes s
2681068 a causa de tu fe has visto que tomar sobre m carne y sangre
2681069 seg n la manera y a semejanza del mismo cuerpo con que se mostr a los nefitas
2681070 este cuerpo que ves ahora es el cuerpo de mi esp ritu y as como me aparezco a ti en el esp ritu aparecer a mi pueblo en la carne
2681071 jes s se mostr a este hombre en el esp ritu
2681072 nunca me he mostrado al hombre de esta manera sin mi voluntad movido nicamente por la fe del que contempla
2681073 jam s ha venido a m hombre alguno con tan grande fe como la que t tienes porque de no haber sido as no hubieras podido ver mi dedo jam s ha cre do en m el hombre como t lo has hecho
2681074 y debido al conocimiento el cual vino como resultado de la fe de este hombre no se le pudo impedir que viera dentro del velo por lo que teniendo este conocimiento perfecto de dios fue imposible impedirle ver dentro del velo por tanto vio a jes s
2681075 puede dios crear una roca tan pesada que l mismo no pueda levantar
2681076 puede dios esconder algo de tal forma que no pueda encontrarlo
2681077 es posible tener una fe tan grande que ni siquiera dios pueda resistirse a ella
2681078 a este hombre no se le pudo impedir que viera dentro del velo fue imposible impedirle ver dentro del velo
2681079 todos los habitantes de la tierra que hab a habido y tambi n todos los que hab a de haber y no los ocult de su vista aun hasta los cabos de la tierra
2681080 el se or no pod a ocultarle nada porque sab a que el se or pod a mostrarle todas las cosas
2681081 todos los habitantes de la tierra que hab a habido y tambi n todos los que hab a de haber aun hasta los cabos de la tierra
2681082 jam s se manifestaron cosas mayores que las que le fueron mostradas al hermano de jared
2681083 ejerzan la fe en m dice el se or as como lo hizo el hermano de jared para que se santifiquen en m entonces les manifestar las cosas que vio el hermano de jared aun hasta desplegar ante ellos todas mis revelaciones
2681084 fue preparado desde la fundaci n del mundo para redimir a su pueblo
2681085 yo soy el que fue preparado desde la fundaci n del mundo para redimir a mi pueblo
2681086 en m todo el g nero humano tendr vida y la tendr eternamente s aun cuantos crean en mi nombre y llegar n a ser mis hijos y mis hijas
2681087 porque sabes estas cosas eres redimido de la ca da
2681088 por tanto eres tra do de nuevo a mi presencia por consiguiente yo me manifiesto a ti
2681089 y cualquier cosa que persuada a los hombres a hacer lo bueno
2681090 con un coraz n quebrantado y un esp ritu contrito
2681091 que el padre se ha acordado del convenio que hizo
2681092 ser n manifestadas a los ojos de todo el pueblo
2681093 ser enaltecido para morar en el reino preparado para l desde la fundaci n del mundo
2681094 venid a m oh gentiles y os mostrar las cosas mayores el conocimiento que se ha ocultado a causa de la incredulidad
2681095 venid a m oh casa de israel y os ser manifestado cu n grandes cosas el padre ha reservado para vosotros desde la fundaci n del mundo y no han llegado a vosotros por motivo de la incredulidad
2681096 he aqu cuando rasgu is ese velo de incredulidad que os hace permanecer en vuestro espantoso estado de iniquidad y dureza de coraz n y ceguedad de mente entonces las slide 25 cosas grandes y maravillosas que han estado ocultas de vosotros desde el principio del mundo s cuando invoqu is al padre en mi nombre con un coraz n quebrantado y un esp ritu contrito entonces sabr is que el padre se ha acordado del convenio que hizo con vuestros padres oh casa de israel
2681097 y s oh se or que t tienes todo poder y que puedes hacer cuanto quieras para el beneficio del hombre
2681098 por boca de dos o tres testigos se decidir todo asunto
2681099 por el poder de dios se mostrar n las planchas y en boca de tres testigos se establecer n estas cosas y el testimonio de tres y esta obra en la cual se mostrar el poder de dios y tambi n su palabra de la cual el padre y el hijo y el esp ritu santo dan testimonio y todo esto se levantar como testimonio contra el mundo en el postrer d a
2681100 he aqu hay muchas cosas grabadas en las planchas menores de nefi que dan mayor claridad a mi evangelio
2681101 y ahora yo nefi escribo m s de las palabras de isa as porque mi alma se deleita en sus palabras
2681102 y mi hermano jacob tambi n lo ha visto por tanto transmitir las palabras de ellos a mis hijos para probarles que mis palabras son verdaderas por tanto ha dicho dios por las palabras de tres establecer mi obra
2681103 mi alma y podr a haber dicho las almas de los tres se deleita en comprobar a nuestro pueblo la verdad de la venida de cristo que salvo que cristo venga todos los hombres deben perecer
2681104 uno que descend a del cielo y vio que su slide 29 resplandor era mayor que el del sol al mediod a
2681105 la venida de un mes as y tambi n la redenci n del mundo
2681106 un mes as o en otras palabras un salvador del mundo
2681107 y tambi n habl concerniente a los profetas del gran n mero que hab a testificado de estas cosas referentes a este mes as de quien l hab a hablado o sea de este redentor del mundo
2681108 por lo tanto todo el g nero humano se hallaba en un estado perdido y ca do y lo estar a para siempre a menos que confiase en este redentor
2681109 bautizar a en bet bara del otro lado del jord n
2681110 y despu s de haber bautizado al mes as con agua ver a y dar a testimonio de haber bautizado al cordero de dios quien quitar a los pecados del mundo
2681111 resucitar a de entre los muertos y se manifestar a a los gentiles
2681112 que recibi por la fe que ten a en el hijo de dios
2681113 pero he aqu el se or ha redimido a mi alma del infierno he visto su gloria y estoy para siempre envuelto en los brazos de su amor
2681114 un hombre que desciende del cielo el hijo de dios
2681115 una virgen m s hermosa y pura que toda otra virgen
2681116 el cordero de dios s el hijo del padre eterno
2681117 ampliamente en el coraz n de los hijos de los hombres
2681118 m s deseable que todas las cosas el de mayor gozo para el alma el m s grande de todos los dones de dios
2681119 afligidas con toda clase de males y con demonios y con esp ritus impuros
2681120 levantado sobre la cruz e inmolado por los pecados del mundo
2681121 doctrina y convenios y la perla de gran precio establecer an junto con el libro de morm n la veracidad del primero la biblia todo lo cual manifestar a
2681122 reunidos en uno solo porque hay un dios y un pastor sobre toda la tierra
2681123 los ltimos sean los primeros y los primeros sean los ltimos
2681124 tanto en palabra como tambi n en poder real y verdaderamente para quitar sus tropiezos
2681125 contados entre los de la casa de israel y ser n para siempre un pueblo bendito sobre la tierra prometida y
2681126 una obra grande y maravillosa entre los hijos de los hombres
2681127 su rectitud y el poder de dios en gran gloria
2681128 la v a para el cumplimiento de sus convenios que l ha hecho con su pueblo que es de la casa de israel
2681129 a causa de su iniquidad juzgar a a cristo como cosa de ning n valor por tanto lo azotan y l lo soporta lo hieren y l lo soporta s escupen sobre l y l lo soporta por motivo de su amorosa bondad y su longanimidad para con los hijos de los hombres
2681130 el se or su dios su redentor yendo delante de ellos conduci ndolos de d a y d ndoles luz de noche
2681131 y el dios de nuestros padres que fueron llevados fuera de egipto fuera de la servidumbre y a quienes tambi n preserv en l desierto s el dios de abraham y de isaac y el dios de jacob se entrega a s mismo como hombre
2681132 ciertamente el se or dios visitar a toda la casa de israel en ese d a a algunos con su voz a causa de su rectitud para su inmensa alegr a y salvaci n y a otros con los truenos y rel mpagos de su poder por tempestades por fuego por humo y vapores de tinieblas y por el hendimiento de la tierra y monta as que se levantar n
2681133 y se hender n las rocas de la tierra y a causa de los gemidos de la tierra muchos de los reyes de las islas del mar se ver n constre idos a exclamar por el esp ritu de dios el dios de la naturaleza padece
2681134 apartaron sus corazones desechando se ales y prodigios y el poder y la gloria del dios de israel
2681135 entonces l se acordar de los convenios que hizo con sus padres y toda la tierra ver la salvaci n del se or toda naci n tribu lengua y pueblo ser n bendecidos
2681136 profeta de en medio de ti de tus hermanos como yo te levantar jehov tu dios a l oir is
2681137 mas a cualquiera que no oyere mis palabras que l hablare en mi nombre yo le pedir cuenta
2681138 yo nefi os declaro que este profeta de quien habl mois s ser el santo del israel por tanto juzgar con justicia
2681139 y r pidamente se acerca el tiempo en que los justos han de ser conducidos como becerros de la manada y el santo de israel ha de reinar con dominio y fuerza y potestad y gran gloria
2681140 y recoge a sus hijos de las cuatro partes de la tierra y cuenta a sus ovejas y ellas lo conocen y habr un redil y un pastor y l apacentar a sus ovejas y en l hallar n pasto
2681141 cuando llegue el d a en que el unig nito del padre s el padre del cielo y de la tierra se manifieste l mismo a ellos en la carne he aqu lo rechazar n por causa de sus iniquidades y la dureza de sus corazones y lo duro de su cerviz
2681142 he aqu lo crucificar n y despu s de ser puesto en un sepulcro por espacio de tres d as se levantar de entre los muertos con salvaci n en sus alas y todos los que crean en su nombre ser n salvos en el reino de dios por tanto mi alma se deleita en profetizar concerniente a l porque he visto su d a y mi coraz n magn fica su santo nombre
2681143 sean persuadidos a creer en cristo el hijo de dios y la expiaci n que es infinita para todo el g nero humano y cuando llegue ese d a en que crean en cristo y oren al padre en su nombre con corazones puros y manos
2681144 y el se or volver a extender su mano por segunda vez para restaurar a su pueblo de su estado perdido y ca do por tanto l proceder a efectuar una obra maravillosa y un prodigio entre los hijos de los hombres
2681145 para convencerlos de que no deben esperar m s a un mes as que ha de venir pues no ha de venir otro porque no hay sino un mes as de quien los profetas han hablado y ese mes as es el que los jud os rechazar n su nombre ser jesucristo el hijo de dios
2681146 no hay otro nombre dado debajo del cielo sino el de este jesucristo de quien he hablado mediante el cual el hombre pueda ser salvo
2681147 por tanto estos escritos ir n de generaci n en generaci n mientras dure la tierra
2681148 porque nosotros trabajamos diligentemente para escribir a fin de persuadir a nuestros hijos as como a nuestros hermanos a creer en cristo y a reconciliarse con dios pues sabemos que es por la gracia por la que nos salvamos despu s de hacer cuanto podamos
2681149 pues para este fin se dio la ley por tanto para nosotros la ley ha muerto y somos vivificados en cristo a causa de nuestra fe guardamos empero la ley a causa de los mandamientos
2681150 y hablamos de cristo nos regocijamos en cristo predicamos de cristo profetizamos de cristo y escribimos seg n nuestras profec as para que nuestros hijos sepan a qu fuente han de acudir para la remisi n de sus pecados
2681151 por tanto deb is inclinaros ante l y adorarlo con todo vuestro poder mente y fuerza y con toda vuestra alma y si hac is esto de ninguna manera ser is desechados
2681152 esperan anhelosamente con firmeza en cristo aguardando las se ales que son declaradas a pesar de todas las persecuciones he aqu son ellos los que no perecer n
2681153 mas el hijo de justicia se les aparecer y l los salvar y tendr n paz con l hasta que hayan transcurrido tres generaciones y muchos de la cuarta generaci n hayan fallecido en rectitud
2681154 porque l ama al mundo al grado de dar su propia vida para traer a todos los hombres a l
2681155 he aqu acaso exclama l a alguien diciendo ap rtate de m
2681156 he aqu ha mandado l a alguno que salga de las sinagogas o de las casas de adoraci n
2681157 ha mandado l a alguien que no participe de su salvaci n
2681158 porque l hace lo que es bueno entre los hijos de los hombres y nada hace que no sea claro para los hijos de los hombres y l invita a todos ellos a que vengan a l y participen de su bondad y a nadie de los que a l vienen desecha sean negros o blancos esclavos o libres varones o mujeres y se acuerda de los paganos y todos son iguales ante dios tanto los jud os como los gentiles
2681159 unas pocas de las palabras acerca de la doctrina de cristo
2681160 os hablar claramente seg n la claridad de mis profec as
2681161 y haced las cosas que me hab is visto hacer
2681162 podemos seguir a jes s a menos que estemos dispuestos a guardar los mandamientos del padre
2681163 seguir al hijo con ntegro prop sito de coraz n significa actuar sin acci n hip crita y sin enga o ante dios sino con verdadera intenci n arrepinti ndoos de vuestros pecados testificando al padre que slide 38 est is dispuestos a tomar sobre vosotros el nombre de cristo
2681164 por tanto haced las cosas que os he dicho que he visto que har vuestro se or y redentor
2681165 con sus labios me honran pero su coraz n lejos est de m
2681166 sino con verdadera intenci n arrepinti ndonos de nuestros pecados
2681167 y el padre dijo arrepent os arrepent os y sed bautizados en el nombre de mi amado hijo
2681168 y adem s vino a m la voz del hijo
2681169 ahora bien si el cordero de dios que es santo tiene necesidad de ser bautizado en el agua para cumplir con toda justicia cu nto mayor es entonces la necesidad que tenemos nosotros siendo pecadores de ser bautizados s en el agua
2681170 mostr a los hijos de los hombres que seg n la carne l se humilla ante el padre y testifica ante el padre que le ser a obediente al observar sus mandamientos
2681171 muestra a los hijos de los hombres la angostura de la senda y la estrechez de la puerta por la cual ellos deben entrar habi ndoles l puesto el ejemplo por delante
2681172 tomar sobre s el nombre de cristo por medio del bautismo s siguiendo a su se or y salvador y descender al agua
2681173 a quien se bautice en mi nombre el padre dar el esp ritu santo como a m
2681174 s siguiendo a vuestro se or y salvador y descendiendo al agua seg n su palabra he aqu entonces recibir is el esp ritu santo
2681175 porque la puerta por la cual deb is entrar es el arrepentimiento y el bautismo en el agua
2681176 y entonces viene una remisi n de vuestros pecados por fuego y por el esp ritu santo
2681177 despu s de haberos arrepentido de vuestros pecados y testificado al padre por medio del bautismo de agua que est is dispuestos a guardar mis mandamientos y hab is recibido el bautismo de fuego y del esp ritu santo y pod is hablar con una nueva lengua s con la lengua de ngeles si despu s de esto me neg is mejor os habr a sido no haberme conocido
2681178 y ahora bien amados hermanos m os por esto s que a menos que el hombre persevere hasta el fin siguiendo el ejemplo del hijo de dios viviente no puede se salvo
2681179 y ahora bien amados hermanos m os despu s de haber entrado en esta estrecha y angosta senda quisiera preguntar si ya qued hecho todo
2681180 por tanto deb is seguir adelante con firmeza en cristo teniendo un fulgor perfecto de esperanza y amor por dios y por todos los hombres por tanto si march is adelante deleit ndoos en la palabra de cristo y persever is hasta el fin he aqu as dice el padre tendr is la vida eterna
2681181 y ahora bien amados hermanos m os sta es la senda y no hay otro camino ni nombre dado debajo del cielo por el cual el hombre pueda salvarse en el reino de dios y ahora bien he aqu sta es la doctrina de cristo y la nica y verdadera doctrina del padre y del hijo y del esp ritu santo que son un dios sin fin am n
2681182 amados hermanos m os supongo que estar is meditando en vuestros corazones en cuanto a lo que deb is hacer despu s que hay is entrado en la senda mas he aqu por qu medit is estas cosas en vuestros corazones
2681183 deleitarse en la palabra de cristo porque he aqu las palabras de cristo les dir an todas las cosas que deber an hacer
2681184 no ped an ni llamaban y deb an perecer en las tinieblas
2681185 a causa de la incredulidad y la maldad y la ignorancia y la obstinaci n de lo hombres
2681186 no quieren buscar conocimiento ni entender el gran conocimiento cuando les es dado con claridad o s con toda la claridad de la palabra
2681187 hablan de jes s y los persuaden a creer en l y a perseverar hasta el fin que es la vida eterna me glor o en mi jes s
2681188 a menos que se reconcilien con cristo y entren por la puerta angosta y caminen por la senda estrecha que gu a a la vida y contin en en la senda hasta el fin del d a de probaci n
2681189 y ahora bien mis amados hermanos y tambi n vosotros los jud os y todos los extremos de la tierra escuchad estas palabras y creed en cristo y si no cre is en estas palabras creed en cristo
2681190 cristo os manifestar con poder y gran gloria que son sus palabras y ante su tribunal nos veremos cara a cara vosotros y yo y sabr is que l me ha mandado escribir estas cosas a pesar de mi debilidad
2681191 y ahora bien amados hermanos m os todos los que sois de la casa de israel y todos vosotros oh extremos de la tierra os hablo como la voz de uno que clama desde el polvo adi s hasta que venga ese gran d a
2681192 t has padecido aflicciones y mucho pesar en tu infancia
2681193 no obstante conoces la grandeza de dios y l consagrar tus aflicciones para tu provecho
2681194 yo s que t est s redimido a causa de la justicia de tu redentor
2681195 porque has visto que en la plenitud de los tiempos l vendr para traer la salvaci n a los hombres
2681196 y en tu juventud has visto su gloria por lo tanto bienaventurado eres as como lo ser n aquellos a favor de quienes l ejercer su ministerio en la carne
2681197 yo en verdad hab a visto ngeles y me hab an ministrado
2681198 se me ha manifestado porque he o do y visto
2681199 predicaciones que fuesen sagradas revelaci n que fuesen grandes o profec as
2681200 por causa de cristo y por el bien de nuestro pueblo
2681201 recordad que el valor de las almas es grande a la vista de dios
2681202 y ha resucitado de entre los muertos para traer a todos los hombres a l mediante las condiciones del arrepentimiento
2681203 y cu n grande es su gozo por el alma que se arrepiente
2681204 as que sois llamados a proclamar el arrepentimiento a este pueblo
2681205 tuvimos muchas revelaciones y el esp ritu de mucha profec a
2681206 por tanto sab amos de cristo y su reino que hab a de venir
2681207 por lo que trabajamos diligentemente entre los de nuestro pueblo a fin de persuadirlos a venir a cristo
2681208 por tanto quisiera dios que todos los hombres creyeran en cristo y contemplaran su muerte y sufrieran su cruz soportaran la verg enza del mundo
2681209 obramos diligentemente para grabar estas palabras sobre planchas esperando que nuestros amados hermanos y nuestros hijos
2681210 sepan que nosotros sab amos de cristo y ten amos la esperanza de su gloria muchos siglos antes de su venida y no solamente ten amos nosotros una esperanza de su gloria sino tambi n todos los santos profetas que vivieron antes que nosotros
2681211 he aqu ellos creyeron en cristo y adoraron al padre en su nombre y tambi n nosotros adoramos al padre en su nombre
2681212 porque dios las declar tambi n a los profetas de la antig edad
2681213 mandar en el nombre de jes s y los rboles mismos obedecen o los montes o las olas del mar
2681214 reconciliaos con l por medio de la expiaci n de cristo su unig nito hijo y podr is obtener la resurrecci n seg n el poder de la resurrecci n que est en cristo y ser presentados como las primicias de cristo a dios teniendo fe y habiendo obtenido una buena esperanza de gloria en l antes que se manifieste en la carne
2681215 y ahora bien amados m os no os maravill is de que os diga estas cosas pues por qu no hablar de la expiaci n de cristo y lograr un perfecto conocimiento de una resurrecci n y del mundo venidero
2681216 si pod is entender la resurrecci n y todo lo que conllevan las promesas del mundo venidero no deb is estar completamente versados en la doctrina de la expiaci n la cual hace que la resurrecci n no resulte plenamente eficaz
2681217 el mes as vendr en la plenitud de los tiempos a fin de redimir a los hijos de los hombres de la ca da
2681218 escoger la libertad y la vida eterna por medio del gran mediador de todos los hombres
2681219 la redenci n viene en el santo mes as y por medio de l porque l es lleno de gracia y de verdad
2681220 he aqu l se ofrece a s mismo en sacrificio por el pecado para satisfacer las demandas de la ley por todos los de coraz n quebrantado y de esp ritu contrito
2681221 por lo tanto cu n grande es la importancia de dar a conocer estas cosas a los habitantes de la tierra para que sepan que ninguna carne puede morar en la presencia de dios sino
2681222 de manera que l es las primicias para dios pues l interceder por todos los hijos de los hombres y los que crean en l ser n salvos
2681223 os hablo otra vez porque anhelo el bienestar de vuestras almas s grande es mi preocupaci n por vosotros y a vosotros mismos os consta que siempre lo ha sido porque os he exhorta con toda diligencia y os he ense ado las palabras de mi padre y os he hablado tocante a todas las cosas que est n escritas desde la creaci n del mundo
2681224 me ha mostrado que se ha de manifestar a ellos en la carne y que despu s que se haya manifestado lo azotar n y lo crucificar n
2681225 cuando lleguen al conocimiento de su redentor ser reunidos de nuevo en las tierras de su herencia
2681226 el mes as se dispondr por segunda vez restaurarlos por lo tanto cuando llegue el d a en que en l crean l se manifestar a ellos con poder y gran gloria hasta 1a destrucci n de sus enemigos y no ser destruido ninguno que crea en l
2681227 supieran de los convenios del se or que ha concertado con toda la casa de israel
2681228 levantar sus cabezas para siempre a causa de las bendiciones que el se or dios conferir a todos sus hijos
2681229 se deje someter al hombre en la carne a fin de que todos los hombres queden sujetos a l
2681230 diablos ngeles de un diablo para ser separados de la presencia de nuestro dios
2681231 conocimiento perfecto de toda nuestra culpa e impureza de todo nuestro arrepentimiento y rectitud
2681232 aquellos que son justo ser n justos todav a y los que son inmundos ser inmundos todav a
2681233 aquellos que han cre do en el santo de israel quien han soportado las cruces del mundo y menospreciado la verg enza de ellos
2681234 sabe todas las cosas y no existe nada sin que l lo sepa
2681235 toda criatura viviente tanto hombres como mujeres y ni os que pertenecen a la familia de ad n
2681236 cuando llegue el d a en que crean en m que yo soy el cristo
2681237 y al que llamare l abrir y los sabios y los instruidos los que son ricos que se inflan a causa de su conocimiento y su sabidur a y sus riquezas s stos son los que l desprecia y menos que desechen estas cosas y se consideren insensatos ante dios y desciendan a las profundidades de la humildad l no le abrir
2681238 venid hermanos m os todos los que teng is sed venid a las aguas y venga aquel que no tiene dinero y compre y coma s venid y comprad vino y leche sin dinero y sin precio
2681239 cu n grandes son los convenios del se or y cu n grandes sus condescendencias para con los hijos de los hombres
2681240 as pues dios os levante de la muerte por el poder de la resurrecci n y tambi n de la muerte eterna por el poder de la expiaci n a fin de que se is recibidos en el reino eterno de dios para que lo alab is por medio de la divina gracia
2681241 ninguno de los profetas ha escrito y profetizado sin que haya hablado concerniente a este cristo
2681242 oh mis queridos hermanos apartaos de vuestros pecados sacudid de vosotros las cadenas de aquel que quiere atare fuertemente venid a aquel dios que es la roca de vuestra salvaci n
2681243 le fue contado a abraham en desierto el ser obediente a los mandamientos de dios al ofrecer a su hijo isaac que es una semejanza de dios y de su hijo unig nito
2681244 a causa del tropiezo de los jud os ellos rechazar n la roca sobre la cual podr an edifica tener fundamento seguro
2681245 mas he aqu que esta roca seg n las escrituras llegar a el grande y el ltimo y el nico y seguro fundamento sobre el cual los jud os podr n edificar
2681246 c mo ser posible que stos despu s de haber rechazado el fundamento seguro puedan jam s edificar sobre l para que sea la principal piedra angular
2681247 as pues amados hermanos reconciliaos con dios por medio de la expiaci n de cristo su unig nito hijo teniendo fe y habiendo obtenido una buena esperanza de gloria en l antes que se manifieste en la carne por qu no hablar de la expiaci n de cristo y lograr un perfecto conocimiento de l
2681248 a fin de convencerlos m s plenamente de que creyeran en el se or su redentor les le lo que escribi el profeta isa as
2681249 por tanto escuchad oh pueblo m o que sois de la casa de israel y dad o dos a mis palabras

2681260 del aumento de su dominio y paz no habr fin sobre el trono de david y sobre su reino a fin de disponerlo y confirmarlo como juicio y con justicia desde ahora y para siempre el celo del se or de los ej rcitos har esto
2681261 el se or se levanta para litigar se pone pie para juzgar al pueblo
2681262 escuchad al que es vuestro intercesor con el padre que aboga por vuestra causa ante l
2681263 por tanto padre perdona a estos mis hermanos que creen en mi nombre para que vengan a m y tengan vida eterna
2681264 tambi n te pondr por luz de los gentiles para que seas mi salvaci n hasta lo postrero de la tierra
2681265 as dice el se or el redentor de israel el santo suyo al menospreciado del hombre al abominado de las naciones al siervo de soberanos reyes ver n y se levantar n y pr ncipes tambi n adorar n a causa del se or que es fiel
2681266 as dice el se or en el tiempo propicio os he escuchado oh islas del mar y en el d a de salvaci n os he ayudado
2681267 para que dig is a los presos salid y a los que est n en tinieblas manifestaos en los caminos ser n apacentados y en todas las alturas habr pastos para ellos
2681268 el esp ritu de jehov el se or est sobre m porque me ungi jehov me ha enviado a predicar buenas nuevas a los abatidos a vendar a los quebrantados de coraz n a publicar libertad a los cautivos y a los presos apertura de la c rcel
2681269 a ordenar que a los afligidos de si n se les d gloria en lugar de ceniza leo de gozo en lugar de luto manto de alegr a en lugar del esp ritu angustiado y ser n llamados rboles de justicia plant o de jehov para gloria suya

2681271 cantad oh cielos y al grate oh tierra porque ser n asentados los pies de los que est n en el oriente
2681272 mas he aqu si n ha dicho el se or me abandon y de m se ha olvidado mi se or pero l mostrar que no
2681273 porque puede una mujer olvidar a su ni o de pecho al grado de no compadecerse del hijo de sus entra as
2681274 pues he aqu te tengo grabada en las palmas de mis manos tus muros est n siempre delante de m
2681275 te he repudiado yo o te he echado de mi lado para siempre
2681276 con un poco de ira escond mi rostro de ti por un momento mas con misericordia eterna tendr compasi n de ti dice el se or tu redentor
2681277 y saldr una vara del tronco de isa y un v stago reto ar de sus ra ces
2681278 y sobre l reposar el esp ritu del se or el esp ritu de sabidur a y de entendimiento el esp ritu de consejo y de poder el esp ritu de conocimiento y de temor del se or
2681279 sino que con justicia juzgar a los pobres y reprender con equidad por los mansos de la tierra y con la vara de su boca herir la tierra y con el aliento de sus labios matar al imp o
2681280 y la justicia ser el ce idor de sus lomos y la fidelidad el cintur n de sus ri ones
2681281 cit el und cimo cap tulo de isa as diciendo que estaba por cumplirse
2681282 el rey que reinar personalmente sobre la tierra durante el milenio ser el v stago que sali de la casa de david
2681283 el se or habl de igual modo por medio de zacar as as dice jehov de los ej rcitos he aqu yo traigo a mi siervo el renuevo v stago quitar el pecado de la tierra en un d a en aquel d a dice jehov de los ej rcitos cada uno de vosotros convidar a su compa ero debajo de su vid y debajo de su higuera
2681284 est perfectamente claro que el v stago de david es cristo
2681285 cu n glorioso ser el d a en que el segundo david que es cristo reine sobre el trono del primer david cuando todos los hombres moren en seguridad cuando la tierra est cubierta de templos y cuando el convenio del evangelio tenga plena fuerza y validez en toda la tierra
2681286 y con justicia juzgar el se or dios a los pobres y con equidad reprender por los mansos de la tierra y herir la tierra con la vara de su boca y con el aliento de sus labios matar al imp o
2681287 y morar tambi n el lobo con el cordero y el leopardo con el cabrito se acostar el becerro el leoncillo y el ceb n cantar n juntos y un ni o los pastorear
2681288 y la vaca y la osa pacer n sus cr as se echar n juntas y el le n comer paja como el buey
2681289 y el ni o de pecho jugar sobre la cueva del spid y el reci n destetado extender su mano sobre la caverna de la v bora
2681290 no da ar n ni destruir n en todo mi santo monte porque la tierra estar llena del conocimiento del se or como las aguas cubren el mar
2681291 y en aquel d a habr una ra z de isa la cual estar puesta por pend n al pueblo los gentiles la buscar n y su descanso ser glorioso
2681292 y levantar pend n a las naciones y congregar a los desterrados de israel y reunir a los dispersos de jud de los cuatro cabos de la tierra
2681293 y acontecer en los postreros d as que el monte de la casa del se or ser establecido como cabeza de los montes y ser exaltado sobre los collados y todas las naciones correr n hacia l
2681294 y vendr n muchos pueblos y dir n venid y subamos al monte del se or a la casa del dios de jacob y nos ense ar acerca de sus caminos y caminaremos por sus sendas porque de si n saldr la ley y de jerusal n la palabra del se or
2681295 y juzgar entre las naciones y reprender a muchos pueblos y forjar n sus espadas en rejas de arado y sus lanzas en hoces
2681296 venid oh casa de jacob y caminemos a la luz del se or s venid porque todos os hab is descarriado cada cual por sus sendas de maldad
2681297 el se or dios me abri el o do y no fui rebelde ni me torn atr s
2681298 entregu mis espaldas al heridor y mis mejillas a los que arrancaban la barba
2681299 porque el se or dios me ayudar de modo que no ser confundido
2681300 virtuoso o bello o de buena reputaci n o digno de alabanza
2681301 subir cual renuevo delante de l y como ra z de tierra seca
2681302 no hay parecer en l ni hermosura le veremos mas sin atractivo para que le deseemos
2681303 despreciado y desechado entre los hombres var n de dolores experimentado en quebranto y como que escondimos de l el rostro fue menospreciado y no lo estimamos
2681304 el el lama sabactani esto es dios m o dios m o por qu me has desamparado
2681305 mas l herido fue por nuestras rebeliones molido por nuestros pecados el castigo de nuestra paz fue sobre l y por su llaga fuimos nosotros curados todos nosotros nos descarriamos como ovejas cada cual se apart por su camino mas jehov carg en l el pecado de todos nosotros
2681306 angustiado l y afligido no abri su boca como cordero fue llevado al matadero y como oveja delante de sus trasquiladores enmudeci y no abri su boca
2681307 le hac a muchas preguntas pero l nada le respondi
2681308 por c rcel y por juicio fue quitado y su generaci n qui n la contar porque fue cortado de la tierra de los vivientes y por la rebeli n de mi pueblo fue herido y se dispuso con los imp os su sepultura mas con los ricos fue en su muerte aunque nunca hizo maldad ni hubo enga o en su boca
2681309 con todo eso jehov quiso quebrantarlo sujet ndole a padecimiento
2681310 ver el fruto de la aflicci n de su alma y quedar satisfecho por su conocimiento justificar mi siervo justo a muchos y llevar las iniquidades de ellos
2681311 comenz a entristecerse y a angustiarse en gran manera hasta la muerte
2681312 como grandes gotas de sangre que ca an hasta la tierra
2681313 padecimiento que hizo que yo dios el mayor de todos temblara a causa del dolor y sangrara por cada poro y padeciera tanto en el cuerpo como en el esp ritu y deseara no tener que beber la amarga copa y desmayar
2681314 yo nefi he escrito estas cosas a los de mi pueblo para que tal vez los persuada a que se acuerden del se or su redentor
2681315 pues he aqu siento estremecimientos en el esp ritu que me agobian al grado de que se debilitan todas mis coyunturas por los que se hallan en jerusal n porque si el se or en
2681316 y ciertamente l mostr a los antiguos profetas todas las cosas concernientes a ellos
2681317 seg n las palabras de los profetas el mes as viene seiscientos a os a partir de la ocasi n en que mi padre sali de jerusal n y seg n las palabras de los profetas y tambi n las palabras del ngel de dios su nombre ser jesucristo el hijo de dios
2681318 porque hemos escrito estas cosas para este fin que sepan que nosotros sab amos de cristo y ten amos la esperanza de su gloria muchos siglos antes de su venida y no solamente ten amos nosotros una esperanza de su gloria sino tambi n todos los santos profetas que vivieron antes que nosotros
2681319 he aqu ellos creyeron en cristo y adoraron al padre en su nombre y tambi n nosotros adoramos al padre en su nombre
2681320 por tanto escudri amos los profetas y tenemos muchas revelaciones y el esp ritu de profec a y teniendo todos estos testimonios logramos una esperanza y nuestra fe se vuelve inquebrantable al grado de que verdaderamente podemos mandar en el nombre de jes s y los rboles mismos nos obedecen o los montes o las olas del mar
2681321 ten a fe en cristo que habr a de venir
2681322 nadie sabe en cuanto a tales cosas porque nadie puede declarar lo que est por venir
2681323 porque en verdad testifican de cristo he aqu te digo que ninguno de los profetas ha escrito ni profetizado sin que haya hablado concerniente a este cristo
2681324 neg las cosas que les hab a ense ado y confes al cristo y el poder del esp ritu santo y la ministraci n de ngeles
2681325 y dijo temo que haya cometido el pecado imperdonable pues he mentido a dios porque negu al cristo y dije que cre a en las escrituras y stas en verdad testifican de l
2681326 a quien nunca jam s has o do ni visto
2681327 persuadi ndolos a mirar adelante hacia el mes as y a creer en su venida como si ya se hubiese verificado
2681328 de eternidad de eternidad descender a del cielo entre los hijos de los hombres y morar a en un tabern culo de barro
2681329 que moran en el coraz n de los hijos de los hombres
2681330 nada logra salvo que sea por la expiaci n de la sangre de cristo
2681331 el ni o que muere en su infancia no perece
2681332 la salvaci n fue y es y ha de venir en la sangre expiatoria de cristo el se or omnipotente
2681333 el hombre natural es enemigo de dios y lo ha sido desde la ca da de ad n y lo ser para siempre jam s a menos que se someta al influjo del santo esp ritu se despoje del hombre natural y se
2681334 y adem s te digo que vendr el d a en que el conocimiento de un salvador se esparcir por toda naci n tribu lengua y pueblo
2681335 y he aqu cuando llegue ese d a nadie salvo los ni os peque os ser hallado sin culpa ante dios sino por el arrepentimiento y la fe en el nombre del se or dios omnipotente
2681336 el se or ha enviado a sus santos profetas entre todos los hijos de los hombres
2681337 para declarar estas cosas a toda familia naci n y lengua para que as quienes creyesen que cristo habr a de venir esos mismos recibiesen la remisi n de sus pecados y se regocijasen con un gozo sumamente grande aun como si l ya hubiese venido entre ellos
2681338 oh ten misericordia y aplica la sangre expiatoria de cristo para que recibamos el perd n de nuestros pecados y sean purificados nuestros corazones porque creemos en jesucristo el hijo de dios que cre el cielo y la tierra y todas las cosas el cual bajar entre los hijos de los hombres
2681339 a causa de la gran fe que ten an en jesucristo que habr a de venir
2681340 m s disposici n a obrar mal sino a hacer lo bueno continuamente
2681341 a concertar un convenio con nuestro dios de hacer su voluntad y ser obedientes a sus mandamientos en todas las cosas que l nos mande todo el resto de nuestros d as
2681342 hoy l os ha engendrado espiritualmente pues dec s que vuestros corazones han cambiado por medio de la fe en su nombre por tanto hab is nacido de l y hab is llegado a ser sus hijos y sus hijas
2681343 quisiera que os acordaseis de conservar siempre escrito este nombre en vuestros corazones para que oig is y conozc is la voz por la cual ser is llamados
2681344 por tanto quisiera que fueseis firmes e inmutables abundando siempre en buenas obras para que cristo el se or dios omnipotente pueda sellaros como suyos a fin de que se is llevados al cielo y teng is salvaci n sin fin y vida eterna mediante la sabidur a y poder y justicia y misericordia de aquel que cre todas las cosas en el cielo y en la tierra el cual es dios sobre todo
2681345 los nombres de todos los que hab an hecho convenio
2681346 no hubo ni un alma salvo los ni os peque os que no hubiese hecho convenio y tomado sobre s el nombre de cristo
2681347 pues he aqu no les profetiz mois s concerniente a la venida del mes as y que dios redimir a a su pueblo
2681348 no han dicho ellos que dios mismo bajar a entre los hijos de los hombres y tomar a sobre s la forma de hombre e ir a con gran poder sobre la faz de la tierra
2681349 s y no han dicho tambi n que llevar a a efecto la resurrecci n de los muertos y que l mismo ser a oprimido y afligido
2681350 las palabras de los profetas s todos los santos profetas que han profetizado concerniente a la venida del se or
2681351 si cristo no hubiese venido al mundo hablando de cosas futuras como si ya hubiesen acontecido no habr a habido redenci n
2681352 y si cristo no hubiese resucitado de los muertos o si no hubiese roto las ligaduras de la muerte para que el sepulcro no tuviera victoria ni la muerte aguij n no habr a habido resurrecci n
2681353 mas hay una resurrecci n por tanto no hay victoria para el sepulcro y el aguij n de la muerte es consumido en cristo
2681354 l es la luz y la vida del mundo s una luz que es infinita que nunca se puede extinguir s y tambi n una vida que es infinita para que no haya m s muerte
2681355 sirvieran a dios y guardaran sus mandamientos para que l derrame su esp ritu m s abundantemente
2681356 se reun an pues en diferentes grupos llamados iglesias y cada iglesia ten a sus sacerdotes y sus maestros y todo sacerdote predicaba la palabra seg n le era comunicada por boca de alma
2681357 todas eran una s la iglesia de dios porque nada se predicaba en todas ellas sino el arrepentimiento y la fe en dios
2681358 sobre s el nombre de cristo o sea el de dios
2681359 el arrepentimiento y la fe en el se or que hab a redimido a su pueblo
2681360 teniendo entrelazados sus corazones con unidad y amor el uno para con el otro
2681361 cada uno de conformidad con lo que tuviera si ten a en m s abundancia deb a dar m s abundantemente y del que ten a poco s lo poco se deb a requerir y al que no tuviera se le habr a de dar y as deb an dar de sus bienes de su propia y libre voluntad y buenos deseos para con dios
2681362 rectamente ante dios ayud ndose el uno al otro temporal y espiritualmente seg n sus necesidades y carencias
2681363 bendito es este pueblo que est dispuesto a llevar mi nombre porque en mi nombre ser n llamados y son m os
2681364 porque soy yo quien tomo sobre m los pecados del mundo porque soy yo el que he creado al hombre y soy yo el que concedo un lugar a mi diestra al que crea hasta el fin
2681365 y entonces sabr n que yo soy el se or su dios que soy su redentor
2681366 me he arrepentido de mis pecados y el se or me ha redimido he aqu he nacido del esp ritu
2681367 y el se or me dijo no te maravilles de que todo el g nero humano s hombres y mujeres toda naci n tribu lengua y pueblo deba nacer otra vez s nacer de dios ser cambiados de su estado carnal y ca do a un estado de rectitud siendo redimidos por dios convirti ndose en sus hijos e hijas
2681368 despu s de pasar mucha tribulaci n arrepinti ndose casi hasta la muerte el se or en su misericordia ha tenido a bien arrebatarme de un fuego eterno y he nacido de dios
2681369 mi alma ha sido redimida de la hiel de amargura y de los lazos de iniquidad me hallaba en el m s tenebroso abismo mas ahora veo la maravillosa luz de dios atormentaba mi alma un suplicio eterno mas he sido rescatado y mi alma no siente m s dolor
2681370 rechac a mi redentor y negu lo que nuestros padres hab an declarado mas ahora para que prevean que l vendr y que se acuerda de toda criatura que ha creado l se manifestar a todos
2681371 s toda rodilla se doblar y toda lengua confesar ante l
2681372 mi alma estaba atribulada en sumo grado y atormentada por todos mis pecados
2681373 el s lo pensar en volver a la presencia de mi dios atormentaba mi alma con indecible horror
2681374 si fuera yo desterrado y aniquilado en cuerpo y alma a fin de no ser llevado a comparecer ante la presencia de dios para ser juzgado por mis obras
2681375 concerniente a la venida de un jesucristo un hijo de dios para expiar los pecados del mundo
2681376 clam dentro de mi coraz n oh jes s hijo de dios ten misericordia de m que estoy en la hiel de amargura y ce ido con las eternas cadenas de la muerte
2681377 qu gozo y qu luz tan maravillosa fue la que vi
2681378 s y desde ese d a aun hasta ahora he trabajado sin cesar para traer almas al arrepentimiento para traerlas a probar el sumo gozo que yo prob para que tambi n nazcan de dios y sean llenas del esp ritu santo
2681379 porque a causa de la palabra que l me ha comunicado he aqu muchos han nacido de dios y han probado como yo he probado y han visto ojo a ojo como yo he visto por tanto ellos saben acerca de estas cosas de que he hablado como yo s y el conocimiento que tengo viene de dios
2681380 s que quienes pongan su confianza en dios ser n sostenidos en sus tribulaciones y sus dificultades y aflicciones y ser n enaltecidos en el postrer d a
2681381 y he sido sostenido en tribulaciones y dificultades de todas clases s y en todo g nero de aflicciones s dios me ha librado de la c rcel y de ligaduras y de la muerte s y pongo mi confianza en l y todav a me fibra
2681382 y negu lo que nuestros padres hab an declarado mas ahora para que prevean que l vendr y que se acuerda de toda criatura que ha creado l se manifestar a todos
2681383 os pregunto hermanos m os de la iglesia hab is nacido espiritualmente de dios
2681384 ejerc is la fe en la redenci n de aquel que os cre
2681385 nadie puede ser salvo a menos que sus vestidos hayan sido lavados hasta quedar blancos s sus vestidos deben ser purificados hasta quedar limpios de toda mancha mediante la sangre de aquel de quien nuestros padres han hablado el cual habr de venir para redimir a su pueblo de sus pecados
2681386 he aqu os digo que el buen pastor os llama s y os llama en su propio nombre el cual es el nombre de cristo y si no quer is dar o dos a la voz del buen pastor al nombre por el cual sois llamados he aqu no sois las ovejas del buen pastor
2681387 os digo que jesucristo vendr s el hijo el unig nito del padre lleno de gracia de misericordia y de verdad y he aqu l es el que viene a quitar los pecados del mundo s los pecados de todo hombre que crea firmemente en su nombre
2681388 seg n la revelaci n de la verdad de la palabra que sus padres hab an hablado y de acuerdo con el esp ritu de profec a que estaba en l conforme al testimonio de jesucristo el hijo de dios que habr a de venir para redimir a su pueblo de sus pecados y de acuerdo con el santo orden mediante el cual alma hab a sido llamado
2681389 hay una que es m s importante que todas las otras
2681390 no est muy lejos el d a en que el redentor viva y venga entre su pueblo
2681391 a este pueblo diciendo arrepent os y preparad la v a del se or y andad por sus sendas que son rectas porque he aqu el reino de los cielos est cerca y el hijo de dios viene sobre la faz de la tierra
2681392 l saldr sufriendo dolores aflicciones y tentaciones de todas clases y esto para que se cumpla la palabra que dice tomar sobre s los dolores y las enfermedades de su pueblo
2681393 y tomar sobre s la muerte para soltar las ligaduras de la muerte que sujetan a su pueblo y sus enfermedades tomara l sobre s para que sus entra as sean llenas de misericordia seg n la carne a fin de que seg n la carne sepa c mo socorrer a los del pueblo de acuerdo con las enfermedades de ellos
2681394 el hijo de dios padece seg n la carne a fin de tomar sobre s los pecados de su pueblo para borrar sus transgresiones seg n el poder de su redenci n
2681395 a fin de que se is lavados de vuestros pecados para que teng is fe en el cordero de dios que quita los pecados del mundo que es poderoso para salvar y para limpiar de toda iniquidad
2681396 el padre eterno mismo del cielo y de la tierra y de todas las cosas que en ellos hay
2681397 el principio y el fin el primero y el ltimo
2681398 en su perfecta forma los miembros as como las coyunturas ser n restaurados a su propia forma y no se perder ni un solo pelo de su cabeza
2681399 un estado de probaci n un tiempo de preparaci n para presentarse ante dios
2681400 habr an sido miserables para siempre no teniendo un estado preparatorio
2681401 alma clam diciendo cu nto tiempo oh se or sufriremos estas grandes aflicciones oh se or fortal cenos seg n nuestra fe que est en cristo hasta tener el poder para librarnos
2681402 porque el se or les hab a concedido poder seg n su fe que estaba en cristo
2681403 si crees en la redenci n de cristo puedes ser sanado
2681404 y cuando alma hubo dicho estas palabras zeezrom se puso en pie de un salto y empez a andar y esto caus un gran asombro entre todo el pueblo y la noticia de ello se extendi por toda la tierra de sidom
2681405 y alma bautiz a zeezrom en el se or y desde entonces empez zeezrom a predicar al pueblo
2681406 el se or derram su esp ritu sobre toda la faz de la tierra a fin de preparar la mente de los hijos de los hombres o sea preparar sus corazones para recibir la palabra que se ense ar a entre ellos en el d a de su venida
2681407 y muchos del pueblo preguntaron acerca del lugar donde el hijo de dios habr a de venir y se les ense que se aparecer a a ellos despu s de su resurrecci n y el pueblo oy esto con gran gozo y alegr a
2681408 el plan de redenci n que fue preparado desde la fundaci n del mundo y tambi n les hizo saber concerniente a la venida de cristo y les dio a conocer todas las obras del se or
2681409 oh se or ten misericordia seg n tu abundante misericordia que has tenido para con el pueblo de nefi tenla para m y mi pueblo
2681410 he aqu he visto a mi redentor y vendr y nacer de una mujer y redimir a todo ser humano que crea en su nombre
2681411 oh bendito jes s que me ha salvado de un terrible y infierno oh dios bendito ten misericordia de este pueblo
2681412 la luz de la gloria de dios que era una maravillosa luz de su bondad
2681413 entonces le dijo aar n a uno de los amalekitas crees que el hijo de dios vendr para redimir al g nero humano de sus pecados
2681414 y le dijo el hombre no creemos que sepas tal cosa
2681415 y aar n empez a explicarles las escrituras concernientes a la venida de cristo y tambi n la resurrecci n de los muertos y que no habr a redenci n para la humanidad salvo que fuese por la muerte y padecimientos de cristo y la expiaci n de su sangre
2681416 aar n le explic las escrituras desde la creaci n de ad n exponi ndole la ca da del hombre y su estado carnal y tambi n el plan de redenci n que fue preparado desde la fundaci n del mundo por medio de cristo para cuantos quisieran creer en su nombre
2681417 y en vista de que el hombre hab a ca do ste no pod a merecer nada de s mismo mas los padecimientos y muerte de cristo exp an sus pecados mediante la fe y el arrepentimiento etc tera
2681418 doy gracias a mi dios porque nos ha concedido que nos arrepintamos de estas cosas y tambi n porque nos ha perdonado nuestros muchos pecados y asesinatos que hemos cometido y ha depurado nuestros corazones de toda culpa por los m ritos de su hijo
2681419 distinguidos por su celo para con dios y tambi n para con los hombres pues eran completamente honrados y rectos en todas las cosas y eran firmes en la fe de cristo aun hasta el fin
2681420 y no ve an la muerte con ning n grado de terror a causa de su esperanza y conceptos de cristo y la resurrecci n por tanto para ellos la muerte era consumida por la victoria de cristo sobre ella
2681421 empez a predicar al pueblo contra las profec as que hab an declarado los profetas concernientes a la venida de cristo
2681422 oh vosotros que est is subyugados por una loca y vana esperanza
2681423 he aqu no pod is saber de las cosas que no veis por lo tanto no pod is saber si habr un cristo
2681424 no se pod a hacer ninguna expiaci n por los pecados de los hombres
2681425 a cada uno le tocaba de acuerdo con su habilidad
2681426 no era ning n crimen el que un hombre hiciese cosa cualquiera
2681427 por qu ense as a este pueblo que no habr cristo para interrumpir su gozo
2681428 y tambi n que cristo vendr tengo todas las cosas como testimonio de que estas cosas son verdaderas
2681429 todas las cosas que han sido dadas por dios al hombre desde el principio del mundo son s mbolo de cristo
2681430 porque soy d bil y semejante iniquidad entre este pueblo contrista mi alma
2681431 oh se or mi coraz n se halla afligido en sumo grado consuela mi alma en cristo conc deme el xito as como a mis consiervos que tengan fuerza para poder sobrellevar las aflicciones que les sobrevendr n
2681432 consuela sus almas en cristo y conc denos lograr el xito al traer a los zoramitas nuevamente a ti en cristo
2681433 el se or les provey a fin de que no padeciesen hambre ni tuviesen sed s y tambi n les dio fuerza para que no padeciesen ning n g nero de aflicciones que no fuesen consumidas en el gozo de cristo
2681434 me o ste por motivo de mis aflicciones y mi sinceridad y es a causa de tu hijo que has sido tan misericordioso conmigo por tanto clamar a ti en todas mis aflicciones porque en ti est mi gozo pues a causa de tu hijo has apartado tus juicios de m
2681435 y ahora bien hermanos m os quisiera preguntar si hab is le do las escrituras
2681436 porque no est escrito que solamente zen s habl de estas cosas sino tambi n zenoc habl de ellas
2681437 pues he aqu que l dijo est s enojado oh se or con los de este pueblo porque no quieren comprender tus misericordias que les has concedido a causa de tu hijo
2681438 y as veis hermanos m os que un segundo profeta de la antig edad ha testificado del hijo de dios
2681439 mas he aqu esto no es todo no son stos los nicos que han hablado concerniente al hijo de dios
2681440 he aqu mois s habl de l s y he aqu fue levantado un s mbolo en el desierto
2681441 mirad y empezad a creer en el hijo de dios que vendr para redimir a los de su pueblo y que padecer y morir para expiar los pecados de ellos y que se levantar de entre los muertos lo cual efectuar la resurrecci n a fin de que todos los hombres comparezcan ante l para ser juzgados en el d a postrero s el d a del juicio seg n sus obras
2681442 y entonces dios os conceda que sean ligeras vuestras cargas mediante el gozo de su hijo
2681443 hermanos m os me parece imposible que ignor is las cosas que se han hablado concernientes a la venida de cristo de quien nosotros ense amos que es el hijo de dios s yo s que se os ense aron ampliamente estas cosas antes de vuestra disensi n de entre nosotros
2681444 el gran interrogante que ocupa vuestras mentes es si la palabra est en el hijo de dios o si no ha de haber cristo
2681445 y tambi n hab is visto que mi hermano os ha comprobado muchas veces que la palabra est en cristo para la salvaci n
2681446 plantar la palabra en sus corazones para que probaran el experimento de su bondad
2681447 y he aqu ahora yo os testificar de m mismo que estas cosas son verdaderas
2681448 poner en efecto las entra as de misericordia que sobrepujan a la justicia
2681449 sus vestidos ser n blanqueados por medio de la sangre del cordero
2681450 contender m s en contra del esp ritu santo sino
2681451 predicar al pueblo el arrepentimiento y la fe en el se or jesucristo ense arles a humillarse y a ser mansos y humildes de coraz n ense arles a resistir toda tentaci n del diablo con su fe en el se or jesucristo
2681452 y ocurri que durante tres d as y tres noches me vi en el m s amargo dolor y angustia de alma y no fue sino hasta que implor misericordia al se or jesucristo que recib la remisi n de mis pecados
2681453 aprende de m que no hay otro modo o medio por el cual el hombre pueda ser salvo sino en cristo y por medio de l he aqu l es la vida y la luz del mundo he aqu l es la palabra de verdad y de rectitud
2681454 y ahora tranquilizar un poco tu mente sobre este punto
2681455 no es tan necesario que el plan de redenci n se d a conocer a este pueblo as como a sus hijos
2681456 no le es tan f cil al se or enviar a su ngel en esta poca para declarar estas gozosas nuevas a nosotros tanto como a nuestros hijos como lo ser despu s del tiempo de su venida
2681457 necesario que el plan de redenci n se d a conocer a todo pueblo
2681458 ya veis que el se or est con nosotros y veis que os ha entregado en nuestras manos
2681459 veis ahora que sta es la verdadera fe de dios s veis que dios nos sostendr y guardar y preservar mientras le seamos fieles a l a nuestra fe y a nuestra religi n y nunca permitir el se or que seamos destruidos a no ser que caigamos en transgresi n y neguemos nuestra fe
2681460 porque todos los creyentes verdaderos de cristo quienes pertenec an a la iglesia as eran llamados por aquellos que no eran de la iglesia de dios
2681461 y los que pertenec an a la iglesia eran fieles s todos los que eran creyentes verdaderos en cristo gozosamente tomaron sobre s el nombre de cristo o sea cristianos como les dec an por motivo de su creencia en cristo que habr a de venir
2681462 ciertamente dios no permitir que nosotros que somos despreciados porque tomamos sobre nosotros el nombre de cristo seamos hollados y destruidos sino hasta que lo provoquemos por nuestras propias transgresiones
2681463 rasgando sus vestidos en se al o como convenio de que no abandonar an al se or su dios o en otras palabras que si llegaban a quebrantar los mandamientos de dios o ca an en trasgresi n y se avergonzaban de tomar sobre ellos el nombre de cristo el se or los destrozar a as como ellos hab an rasgado sus vestidos
2681464 as vemos que la puerta del cielo est abierta para todos s para todos los que quieran creer en el nombre de jesucristo s el hijo de dios
2681465 s vemos que todo aquel que quiera puede asirse a la palabra de dios que es viva y poderosa que partir por medio toda la astucia los lazos y las artima as del diablo y guiar al hombre de cristo por un camino estrecho y angosto a trav s de ese eterno abismo de miseria que se ha dispuesto para hundir a los inicuos
2681466 ayunaron y oraron frecuentemente y se volvieron m s y m s fuertes en su humildad y m s y m s firmes en la fe de cristo hasta henchir slide 89 sus almas de gozo y de consolaci n s hasta la purificaci n y santificaci n de sus corazones santificaci n que viene de entregar el coraz n a dios
2681467 no hay otra manera ni medio por los cuales el hombre pueda ser salvo sino por la sangre expiatoria de jesucristo que ha de venir s recordad que l viene para redimir al mundo
2681468 recordad que es sobre la roca de nuestro redentor el cual es cristo el hijo de dios donde deb is establecer vuestro fundamento para que cuando el diablo lance sus impetuosos vientos s sus dardos en el torbellino s cuando todo su granizo y furiosa tormenta os azote l no tenga poder para arrastraros al abismo de miseria y angustia sin fin a causa de la roca sobre la cual est is edificados que es un fundamento seguro un fundamento sobre el cual si los hombres edifican no caer n
2681469 no solamente neg is mis palabras sino tambi n neg is todas las palabras que nuestros padres han declarado y tambi n las palabras que habl este hombre mois s a quien le fue dado tanto poder s las palabras que l habl concernientes a la venida del mes as
2681470 s no testific l que vendr a el hijo de dios
2681471 y as como cuantos miraron a esa serpiente vivieron de la misma manera cuantos miraren al hijo de dios con fe teniendo un esp ritu contrito vivir n s esa vida que es eterna
2681472 y he aqu no s lo mois s testific de estas cosas sino tambi n todos los santos profetas desde los d as de l aun hasta los d as de abraham
2681473 s y he aqu abraham vio la venida del mes as y se llen de alegr a y se regocij
2681474 s y he aqu os digo que abraham no fue el nico que supo de estas cosas sino que hubo muchos antes de los d as de abraham que fueron llamados seg n el orden de dios s seg n el orden de su hijo y esto con objeto de que se mostrase a los del pueblo muchos miles de a os antes de su venida que la redenci n vendr a a ellos
2681475 y ahora bien quisiera que supieseis que aun desde la poca de abraham ha habido muchos profetas que han testificado de estas cosas s he aqu el profeta zen s testific osadamente y por tal raz n lo mataron
2681476 y he aqu tambi n zenoc y tambi n ezequ as y tambi n isa as y jerem as
2681477 nuestro padre lehi fue echado de jerusal n porque testific de estas cosas nefi tambi n dio testimonio de estas cosas y tambi n casi todos nuestros padres s hasta el d a de hoy s han dado testimonio de la venida de cristo y han mirado hacia adelante y se han regocijado en su d a que est por venir
2681478 profetiz al pueblo todas las cosas que el se or puso en su coraz n
2681479 sino el arrepentimiento y la fe en el se or jesucristo que de seguro vendr al mundo y padecer muchas cosas y morir por su pueblo
2681480 de modo que no habr oscuridad en la noche anterior a su venida al grado de que a los hombres les parecer que es de d a
2681481 jesucristo el hijo de dios el padre del cielo y de la tierra el creador de todas las cosas desde el principio
2681482 viniera la salvaci n s a l le corresponde y se hace necesario que muera para efectuar la resurrecci n de los muertos a fin de que por este medio los hombres sean llevados a la presencia del se or y redima a todo el g nero humano de la primera muerte esa muerte espiritual la ca da de ad n
2681483 ser separados de las cosas que conciernen a la justicia
2681484 con el peso no podr n huir por tanto ser an atropelladas y abandonadas para perecer
2681485 bautizando y profetizando y predicando proclamando el arrepentimiento al pueblo mostrando se ales y prodigios y obrando milagros entre el pueblo a fin de que supieran que el cristo pronto deb a venir
2681486 empezaron a confiar en su propia fuerza y en su propia sabidur a
2681487 y empezaron a raciocinar y a disputar entre s diciendo no es razonable que venga tal ser como un cristo
2681488 que nos han transmitido nuestros padres para hacernos creer en una cosa grande y maravillosa que ha de acontecer pero no entre nosotros sino en una tierra que se halla muy lejana tierra que no conocemos por tanto pueden mantenernos en la ignorancia porque no podemos dar fe con nuestros propios ojos de que son verdaderas
2681489 y muchas m s cosas insensatas y vanas se imaginaron en sus corazones
2681490 es m s deseable que todas las cosas s y el de mayor gozo para el alma
2681491 y estaban reunidas las multitudes de la tierra y se hallaban en un vasto y espacioso edificio y de nuevo habl el ngel del se or diciendo he aqu el mundo y su sabidur a vi y doy testimonio de que el grande y espacioso edificio representaba el orgullo del mundo las vanas ilusiones y el orgullo de los hijos de los hombres
2681492 y nos afanamos por cumplir con los juicios y los estatutos y los mandamientos del se or en todas las cosas seg n la ley de mois s he aqu mi alma se deleita en comprobar a mi pueblo la verdad de la venida de cristo porque con este fin se ha dado la ley de mois s y todas las cosas que han sido dadas por dios al hombre desde el principio del mundo son s mbolo de l
2681493 y a pesar de que creemos en cristo observamos la ley de mois s y esperamos anhelosamente y con firmeza en cristo hasta que la ley sea cumplida
2681494 pues para este fin se dio la ley por tanto para nosotros la ley ha muerto y somos vivificados en cristo a causa de nuestra fe guardamos empero la ley a causa de los mandamientos
2681495 y hablamos de cristo nos regocijamos en cristo predicamos de cristo profetizamos de cristo y escribimos seg n nuestras profec as para que nuestros hijos sepan a qu fuente han de acudir para la remisi n de sus pecados
2681496 por lo tanto hablamos concerniente a la ley para que nuestros hijos sepan que la ley ya no rige y entendiendo que la ley ya no rige miren ellos adelante hacia aquella vida que est en cristo y sepan con qu fin fue dada la ley
2681497 y hasta donde fuere necesario deb is observar las pr cticas y las ordenanzas de dios hasta que sea cumplida la ley que fue dada a mois s
2681498 y despu s que cristo haya resucitado de entre los muertos se os manifestar a vosotros mis hijos y mis amados hermanos y las palabras que l os hable ser n la ley que observar is
2681499 es necesario que l cristo y su evangelio crezca pero que yo juan y la ley de mois s meng e por lo que tambi n se produce un aumento de la comprensi n del evangelio y una disminuci n en el significado de la ley de mois s apreciables ambos en las p ginas del libro de morm n
2681500 y he hablado a los profetas y aument la profec a y por medio de los profetas us par bolas
2681501 tengo una obra para ti mois s hijo m o y t eres a semejanza de mi unig nito y mi unig nito es y ser el salvador porque es lleno de gracia y de verdad
2681502 profeta de en medio de ti de tus hermanos como yo te levantar jehov tu dios a l oir is
2681503 profeta les levantar de en medio de sus hermanos como t y pondr mis palabras en su boca y l les hablar todo lo que yo le mandare
2681504 mas a cualquiera que no oyere mis palabras que l hablare en mi nombre yo le pedir cuenta
2681505 este profeta de quien habl mois s era el santo de israel por tanto juzgar con justicia
2681506 he aqu yo soy aquel de quien mois s habl diciendo el se or vuestro dios os levantar a un profeta de vuestros hermanos semejante a m a l oir is en todas las cosas que os dijere y suceder que toda alma que no escuchare a ese profeta ser desarraigada de entre el pueblo
2681507 escudri ad las escrituras en especial los escritos de mois s y ellas son las que dan testimonio de m yo he venido en nombre de mi padre y no me recib s no pens is que yo voy a acusaros delante del padre hay quien os acusa mois s en quien ten is vuestra esperanza porque si creyeseis a mois s me creer ais a m porque de m escribi l pero si no cre is a sus escritos c mo creer is a mis palabras
2681508 no siempre podemos decir si ciertos ritos espec ficos de los sacrificios realizados en israel formaron parte del sistema mosaico o si eran las mismas ordenanzas efectuadas por ad n y abraham como parte de la propia ley del evangelio es m s parece que algunas de las pr cticas rituales variaron con el tiempo de acuerdo con las necesidades especiales del pueblo y las diferentes circunstancias en las que se encontraba ni siquiera el libro de morm n nos ayuda en este sentido sabemos que los nefitas ofrec an sacrificios y guardaban la ley de mois s pero dado que dispon an del sacerdocio de melquisedec y que no hab a levitas entre ellos suponemos que sus sacrificios databan de antes del ministerio de mois s y que dado que ten an la plenitud del evangelio observaban la ley de mois s en el sentido de que cumpl an con su gran n mero de principios morales y sus infinitas restricciones ticas suponemos que sta ser a una de las razones por las que nefi pudo decir para nosotros la ley ha muerto al menos no hay indicio alguno en el libro de morm n en cuanto a que los nefitas ofrec an los sacrificios diarios requeridos por la ley o que celebraban las diversas fiestas que formaban parte de la vida religiosa de sus parientes del viejo mundo
2681509 y este sacerdocio mayor administra el evangelio y posee la llave de los misterios del reino s la llave del conocimiento de dios
2681510 as que en sus ordenanzas se manifiesta el poder de la divinidad
2681511 y sin sus ordenanzas y la autoridad del sacerdocio el poder de la divinidad no se manifiesta a los hombres en la carne
2681512 mois s claramente ense esto a los hijos de israel en el desierto y procur diligentemente santificar a los de su pueblo a fin de que vieran la faz de dios
2681513 mas endurecieron sus corazones y no pudieron aguantar su presencia por tanto el se or en su ira porque su ira se hab a encendido en contra de ellos jur que mientras estuviesen en el desierto no entrar an en su reposo el cual es la plenitud de su gloria
2681514 por consiguiente tom a mois s de entre ellos y el santo sacerdocio tambi n
2681515 el cual es el evangelio de arrepentimiento y de bautismo y la remisi n de pecados y la ley de los mandamientos carnales que el se or en su vida hizo que continuara en la casa de aar n entre los hijos de israel hasta juan a quien dios levant pues fue lleno del esp ritu santo desde el vientre de su madre
2681516 has desviado a muchos de los de este pueblo de manera que pervierten la recta v a de dios y no guardan la ley mois s que es el camino verdadero y conviertes la ley de mois s en la adoraci n de un ser que dices que vendr de aqu a muchos siglos
2681517 temo que haya cometido el pecado imperdonable pues he mentido a dios porque negu al cristo y dije que cre a en las escrituras y stas en verdad testifican de l
2681518 los profetas y los sacerdotes y los maestros trabajaron diligentemente exhortando con toda longanimidad al pueblo a la diligencia ense ando la ley de mois s y el objeto para el cual fue dada persuadi ndolos a mirar adelante hacia el mes as y a creer en su venida como si ya se hubiese verificado
2681519 y les mostr muchas se ales y maravillas y s mbolos y figuras concernientes a su venida
2681520 y sin embargo endurecieron sus corazones y no comprendieron que la ley de mois s nada logra salvo que sea por la expiaci n de su sangre
2681521 l les respondi intr pidamente e hizo frente a todas sus preguntas s los llen de asombro pues los resisti en todas sus preguntas y los confundi en todas sus palabras
2681522 no hab is aplicado vuestros corazones para entender por tanto no hab is sido sabios
2681523 y de nuevo les dijo si ense is la ley de mois s c mo es que no la cumpl s
2681524 y suceder que ser is heridos por vuestras iniquidades pues hab is dicho que ense is la ley de mois s
2681525 y respondieron y dijeron que la salvaci n ven a por la ley de mois s
2681526 mas les dijo abinad s que si guard is los mandamientos de dios ser is salvos s si guard is los mandamientos que el se or dio a mois s en el monte de sina
2681527 hab is ense ado a este pueblo que debe procurar hacer todas estas cosas a fin de guardar estos mandamientos
2681528 os digo que no porque si lo hubieseis hecho el se or no habr a hecho que yo viniera y profetiza el mal sobre este pueblo
2681529 hab is dicho que la salvaci n viene por la ley de mois s
2681530 y adem s os digo que la salvaci n no viene s lo por la ley y si no fuera por la expiaci n que dios mismo efectuar por los pecados e iniquidades de los de su pueblo stos inevitablemente perecer an a pesar de la ley de mois s
2681531 y ahora os digo que se hizo necesario que se diera una ley a los hijos de israel s una ley muy estricta porque eran una gente de dura cerviz presta para hacer el mal y lenta para acordarse del se or su dios
2681532 mas he aqu os digo que todas estas cosas eran s mbolos de cosas futuras
2681533 ir a con gran poder sobre la faz de la tierra
2681534 y ahora bien no deb is temblar y arrepentiros de vuestros pecados y recordar que solamente en cristo y mediante l pod is ser salvos
2681535 as pues si ense is la ley de mois s ense ad tambi n que es un s mbolo de aquellas cosas que est n por venir
2681536 observaron la ley de mois s porque era necesario que la observaran todav a pues no se hab a cumplido enteramente
2681537 pero no cre an que la salvaci n viniera por la ley de mois s sino que la ley de mois s serv a para fortalecer su fe en cristo
2681538 y en m se ha cumplido la ley de mois s
2681539 la redenci n viene por medio del hijo de dios y l se ha referido a mois s para probar que estas cosas son verdaderas
2681540 fin al derramamiento de sangre entonces quedar cumplida la ley de mois s s ser totalmente cumplida sin faltar ni una jota ni una tilde y nada se habr perdido
2681541 y he aqu ste es el significado entero de la ley pues todo pice se ala a ese gran y postrer sacrificio
2681542 y no hubo contenciones con excepci n de unos pocos que empezaron a predicar intentando probar por medio de las escrituras que ya no era necesario observar la ley mois s mas en esto erraron por no haber entendido las escrituras
2681543 pero acaeci que no tardaron en convertirse y se convencieron del error en que se hallaban porque se les hizo saber que la ley no se hab a cumplido todav a y que era necesario que se cumpliera sin faltar un pice s lleg a ellos la palabra de que era necesario que se cumpliese s que ni una jota ni una tilde pasar a sin que todo se cumpliese
2681544 vine a los m os y los m os no me recibieron y las escrituras concernientes a mi venida se han cumplido
2681545 y a cuantos me han recibido les he concedido llegar a ser hijos de dios y as har con cuantos crean en mi nombre porque he aqu la redenci n viene por m y en m se ha cumplido la ley de mois s
2681546 yo soy la luz y la vida del mundo soy el alfa y la omega el principio y el fin
2681547 y vosotros ya no me ofrecer is m s el derramamiento de sangre s vuestros sacrificios y vuestros holocaustos cesar n porque no aceptar ninguno de vuestros sacrificios ni vuestros holocaustos
2681548 y me ofrec is como sacrificio un coraz n quebrantado y un esp ritu contrito y al que venga a m con un coraz n quebrantado y un esp ritu contrito lo bautizar con fuego y con el esp ritu santo
2681549 no pens is que he venido para abrogar la ley ni los profetas
2681550 no he venido para abrogar sino para cumplir porque en verdad os digo que ni una jota ni una tilde ha pasado de la ley sino en m toda se ha cumplido y he aqu os he dado la ley y los mandamientos de mi padre para que cre is en m que os arrepint is de vuestros pecados y veng is a m con un coraz n quebrantado y un esp ritu contrito he aqu ten is los mandamientos ante vosotros y la ley se ha cumplido por tanto estas cosas que exist an en la antig edad que se hallaban bajo la ley se han cumplido todas en m las cosas antiguas han pasado y todas las cosas se han vuelto nuevas
2681551 porque no entend an la palabra de que las cosas viejas hab an pasado y que todas las cosas se hab an vuelto nuevas
2681552 he aqu os digo que se ha cumplido la ley que fue dada a mois s he aqu soy yo quien di la ley y soy yo el que hice convenio con mi pueblo israel por tanto la ley se cumple en m porque he venido para cumplir la ley por tanto tiene fin he aqu yo no abrogo a los profetas porque cuantos no se han cumplido en m en verdad os digo que todos se cumplir n y porque os dije que las cosas antiguas han pasado no abrogo lo que se ha hablado concerniente a las cosas que est n por venir porque he aqu el convenio que hice con mi pueblo no se ha cumplido enteramente mas la ley que se dio a mois s tiene su fin en m he aqu yo soy la ley y la luz mirad hacia m y perseverad hasta el fin y vivir is porque al que persevere hasta el fin le dar vida eterna he aqu os he dado los mandamientos guardad pues mis mandamientos y esto es la ley y los profetas porque ellos en verdad testificaron de m
2681553 yo os digo que es preciso que guard is la ley de mois s a n mas os digo que vendr el tiempo cuando ya no ser necesario guardar la ley de mois s
2681554 hablamos slide 107 concerniente a la ley para que nuestros hijos sepan que la ley ya no rige y entendiendo que la ley ya no rige miren ellos adelante hacia aquella vida que est en cristo y sepan con qu fin fue dada la ley y para que despu s de cumplirse la ley en cristo no endurezcan contra l sus corazones cuando la ley tenga que ser abrogada
2681555 y ya no se guiaban m s por las pr cticas y ordenanzas de la ley de mois s sino que se guiaban por los mandamientos que hab an recibido de su se or y su dios y sucedi que no hubo contenci n entre todos los habitantes sobre toda la tierra mas los disc pulos de jes s obraban grandes milagros
2681556 todas las cosas que han sido dadas por dios al hombre desde el principio del mundo son s mbolos de cristo
2681557 despu s de haber caminado en la oscuridad por el espacio de muchas horas
2681558 un rbol cuyo fruto era deseable para hacer a uno feliz
2681559 percib que era de lo m s dulce superior a todo cuanto yo hab a probado antes s y vi que su fruto era blanco y exced a toda blancura que yo jam s hubiera visto y al comer de su fruto mi alma se llen de un gozo inmenso
2681560 esto te ser dado por se al que despu s que hayas visto el rbol que dio el fruto que tu padre prob tambi n ver s a un hombre que desciende del cielo y dar s testimonio de que es el hijo de dios
2681561 el cordero de dios s el hijo del padre eterno
2681562 s es el amor de dios que se derrama ampliamente en el coraz n de los hijos de los hombres
2681563 vi que el rbol de la vida representaba el amor de dios
2681564 porque de tal manera am dios al mundo que ha dado a su hijo unig nito
2681565 se derrama ampliamente en el coraz n de los hijos de los hombres
2681566 miraron en derredor de ellos como si se hallasen avergonzados
2681567 se agarraron del slide 110 extremo de la barra de hierro y siguieron hacia adelante asidos constantemente a la barra de hierro hasta que llegaron y se postraron y comieron del fruto del rbol
2681568 al conocimiento del verdadero mes as su se or y su redentor
2681569 al conocimiento del evangelio de su redentor y de los principios exactos de su doctrina para que sepan c mo venir a l y ser salvos
2681570 una leyenda jud a identifica el rbol de la vida como el olivo y por un buen motivo el olivo es un rbol perenne y no caducifolio sus hojas no se marchitan ni caen con las estaciones y parecen rejuvenecer con el calor t rrido y el fr o invernal si no se le cultiva se convierte en un rbol silvestre dif cil de controlar y f cilmente corruptible s lo tras un largo cultivo por lo general de ocho a diez a os comienza a dar fruto y despu s de eso suelen salir nuevos brotes de las ra ces en apariencia muertas el tronco lleno de nudos da la impresi n de penalidades las penalidades de la vida vieja y de la vida renovada
2681571 me aflige que tenga que perder los rboles de mi vi a
2681572 convierten la misericordia del se or en algo emotivamente memorable
2681573 y cu n misericordioso es nuestro dios para con nosotros
2681574 porque l se acuerda de la casa de israel de las ra ces as como de las ramas y les extiende sus manos todo el d a
2681575 allegaos a dios como l se ha allegado a vosotros y mientras su brazo de misericordia se extienda hacia vosotros a la luz del d a no endurezc is vuestros corazones
2681576 rechacemos las palabras que se han hablado en cuanto a cristo
2681577 y ahora bien hermanos m os he hablado claramente para que no pod is errar y como vive el se or dios que sac a israel de la tierra de egipto y dio poder a mois s para sanar a las naciones despu s de haber sido mordidas por las serpientes ponzo osas si pon an sus ojos en la serpiente que l levant ante ellas s he aqu os digo que as como estas cosas son verdaderas y como el se or dios vive no hay otro nombre dado debajo del cielo sino el de este jesucristo de quien he hablado mediante el cual el hombre pueda ser salvo
2681578 mas he aqu no solamente neg is mis palabras sino tambi n neg is las palabras que nuestros padres han declarado y tambi n las palabras que habl este hombre mois s a quien le fue dado tanto poder s las palabras que l ha hablado concernientes a la venida del mes as
2681579 s no testific l que vendr a el hijo de dios
2681580 y as como cuantos miraron a esa serpiente vivieron de la misma manera cuantos miraren al hijo de dios con fe teniendo un esp ritu contrito vivir n s esa vida que es eterna
2681581 mas he aqu al paso que la semilla se hincha y brota y empieza a crecer sab is que la palabra a henchido vuestras almas y tambi n sab is que ha brotado que vuestro entendimiento empieza a iluminarse y vuestra mente comienza a ensancharse
2681582 y he aqu a medida que el rbol empiece a crecer dir is nutr moslo con gran cuidado para que eche ra z crezca y nos produzca fruto
2681583 mas si desatend is el rbol y sois negligentes en nutrirlo he aqu no echar ra ces y cuando el calor del sol llegue y lo abrase se secar porque no tiene ra z y lo arrancar is y lo echar is fuera
2681584 y esto no es porque la semilla no haya sido buena y tampoco es porque su fruto no sea deseable sino porque vuestro terreno es est ril y no quer is nutrir el rbol por tanto no podr is obtener su fruto
2681585 y por lo mismo si no cultiv is la palabra mirando hacia adelante con el ojo de la fe a su fruto nunca podr is recoger el fruto del rbol de la vida
2681586 pero si cultiv is la palabra s y nutr s el rbol mientras empiece a crecer mediante vuestra fe con gran diligencia y complacencia mirando hacia adelante a su fruto echar ra z y he aqu ser un rbol que brotar para vida eterna
2681587 y a causa de vuestra diligencia y vuestra fe y vuestra paciencia al nutrir la palabra para que eche ra ces en vosotros he aqu que con el tiempo recoger is su fruto el cual es sumamente precioso y el cual es m s dulce que todo lo dulce y m s blanco que todo lo blanco s y m s puro que todo lo puro y comer is de este fruto hasta quedar satisfechos de modo que no tendr is hambre ni tendr is sed
2681588 entonces hermanos m os segar is el galard n de vuestra fe y vuestra diligencia y paciencia y longanimidad esperando que el rbol os d fruto
2681589 el cual es sumamente precioso y el cual es m s dulce que todo lo dulce y m s blanco que todo lo blanco s y m s puro que todo lo puro y comer is del evangelio de cristo hasta quedar satisfechos de modo que no tendr is hambre ni tendr is sed
2681590 he aqu mois s habl de cristo s y he aqu fue levantado un s mbolo en el desierto para que quien mirara a l viviera y muchos miraron y vivieron
2681591 y ahora bien hermanos m os quisiera que plantaseis esta palabra en vuestros corazones y al empezar a hincharse nutridla con vuestra fe y he aqu llegar a ser un rbol que crecer en vosotros para vida eterna y entonces dios nos conceda que sean ligeras vuestras cargas mediante el gozo de su hijo
2681592 hermanos m os me parece imposible que ignor is estas cosas que se han hablado concernientes a la venida de cristo de quien nosotros ense amos que es el hijo de dios
2681593 y mi padre me envi para que fuese levantado sobre la cruz y que despu s de ser levantado sobre la cruz pudiese atraer a m mismo a todos los hombres para que as como he sido levantado por los hombres as tambi n los hombres sean levantados por el padre
2681594 y por esta raz n he sido levantado por consiguiente de acuerdo con el poder del padre atraer a m mismo a todos los hombres
2681595 el santo sacerdocio seg n el orden del hijo de dios
2681596 seg n el modelo o ejemplo de igual que semejante a
2681597 sin principio de d as ni fin de a os preparado de eternidad en eternidad seg n la presciencia de dios de todas las cosas
2681598 no tiene principio de d as ni fin de a os y que es lleno de gracia equidad y verdad
2681599 quisiera que os acordaseis de que el se or dios orden sacerdotes seg n su santo orden que era seg n el orden de su hijo para ense ar estas cosas al pueblo
2681600 y esos sacerdotes fueron ordenados seg n del orden de su hijo de una manera que har a saber al pueblo el modo de esperar anhelosamente a su hijo para recibir la redenci n
2681601 y estas ordenanzas se confer an seg n esta manera para que por ese medio el pueblo esperara anhelosamente al hijo de dios ya que era un s mbolo de su orden y esto para esperar anhelosamente de l la remisi n de sus pecados
2681602 santo sacerdocio seg n el orden del hijo de dios
2681603 humillaos as como el pueblo en los d as de melquisedec quien tambi n fue un sumo sacerdote seg n este mismo orden de que he hablado que tambi n tom sobre s el sumo sacerdocio para siempre
2681604 oficio del sumo sacerdocio seg n el santo orden de dios
2681605 mas ninguno fue mayor que l por tanto han hecho de l menci n m s particular
2681606 marcaba el camino que deb an seguir por el desierto
2681607 funcionaban y aparec an de acuerdo con la fe diligencia y atenci n que nosotros les d bamos
2681608 una escritura nueva que era f cil de leer la que nos daba conocimiento respecto a las v as del se or y se escrib a y cambiaba de cuando en cuando seg n la fe y diligencia que nosotros le d bamos
2681609 fue preparada para mostrar a nuestros padres el camino que hab an de seguir por el desierto
2681610 y obr por ellos seg n su fe en dios por tanto si ten an fe para creer que dios pod a hacer que aquellas agujas indicaran el camino que deb an seguir he aqu as suced a por tanto se obr para ellos este milagro as como muchos otros milagros que diariamente se obraban por el poder de dios
2681611 pero fueron perezosos y se olvidaron de ejercer su fe y diligencia y entonces esas obras maravillosas cesaron y no progresaron en su viaje
2681612 quisiera que entendieses hijo m o que estas cosas tienen un significado simb lico porque as como nuestros padres no prosperaron por ser lentos en prestar atenci n a esta br jula y estas cosas eran temporales as es con las cosas que son espirituales
2681613 pues he aqu tan f cil es prestar atenci n a la palabra de cristo que te indicar un curso directo a la felicidad eterna como lo fue para nuestros padres prestar atenci n a esta br jula que les se alaba un curso directo a la tierra prometida
2681614 y ahora digo no se ve en esto un s mbolo
2681615 nosotros creemos en dios el eterno padre y en su hijo jesucristo y en el esp ritu santo
2681616 yo siempre he declarado que dios es un personaje distinto que jesucristo es un personaje aparte y distinto de dios el padre y que el esp ritu santo es otro personaje distinto y es esp ritu y estos tres constituyen tres personajes distintos y tres dioses
2681617 y jes s despu s que fue bautizado subi luego del agua y he aqu los cielos le fueron abiertos y vio al esp ritu de dios que descend a como paloma y ven a sobre l y hubo una voz de los cielos que dec a este es mi hijo amado en quien tengo complacencia
2681618 al reposar sobre m la luz vi en el aire arriba de m a dos personajes cuyo fulgor y gloria no admiten descripci n uno de ellos me habl llam ndome por mi nombre y dijo se alando al otro ste es mi hijo amado esc chalo
2681619 convencer al jud o y al gentil de que jes s es el cristo el eterno dios
2681620 y sea la honra al padre y al hijo y al esp ritu santo que son un dios am n
2681621 y ahora bien amados hermanos m os sta es la senda y no hay otro camino ni nombre dado debajo del cielo por el cual el hombre pueda salvarse en el reino de dios
2681622 todos ser n llevados a comparecer ante el tribunal de cristo el hijo y dios el padre y el santo esp ritu para ser juzgados seg n sus obras sean buenas o malas
2681623 y seg n esta manera bautizar is en mi nombre porque he aqu de cierto os digo que el padre y el hijo y el esp ritu santo son uno y yo soy en el padre y el padre en m y el padre y yo somos uno el padre y yo y el esp ritu santo somos uno
2681624 sabed que deb is llegar al conocimiento de vuestros padres y a arrepentiros de todos vuestros pecados e iniquidades y creer en jesucristo que l es el hijo de dios y que los jud os lo mataron y que por el poder del padre ha resucitado con lo cual ha logrado la victoria sobre la tumba y en l tambi n es consumido el aguij n de la muerte
2681625 y l llevar a efecto la resurrecci n de los muertos mediante la cual los hombres resucitar n para presentarse ante su tribunal
2681626 y l ha efectuado la redenci n del mundo por lo cual a aqu l que en el d a del juicio sea hallado inocente ante l le ser concedido morar en la presencia de dios en su reino para cantar alabanzas eternas con los coros celestes al padre y al hijo y al esp ritu santo que son un dios en un estado de felicidad que no tiene fin
2681627 s l es el padre eterno mismo del cielo y de la tierra y de todas las cosas que en ellos hay es el principio y el fin el primero y el ltimo
2681628 porque he aqu que viene el tiempo y no est muy distante en que con poder el se or omnipotente que reina que era y que es de eternidad en eternidad descender del cielo entre los hijos de los hombres y morar en un tabern culo de barro
2681629 y se llamar jesucristo el hijo de dios el padre del cielo y de la tierra el creador de todas las cosas desde el principio y su madre se llamar mar a
2681630 por tanto quisiera que fueseis firmes e inmutables abundando siempre en buenas obras para que cristo el se or dios omnipotente pueda sellaros como suyos a fin de que se is llevados al cielo y teng is salvaci n sin fin y vida eterna mediante la sabidur a y poder y justicia y misericordia de aquel que cre todas las cosas en el cielo y en la tierra el cual es dios sobre todo
2681631 oh ten misericordia y aplica la sangre expiatoria de cristo para que recibamos el perd n de nuestros pecados y sean purificados nuestros corazones porque creemos en jesucristo el hijo de dios que cre el cielo y la tierra y todas las cosas el cual bajar entre los hijos de los hombres
2681632 porque soy yo quien tomo sobre m los pecados del mundo porque soy yo el que he creado al hombre y soy yo el que concedo un lugar a mi diestra al que crea hasta el fin
2681633 rechac a mi redentor y negu lo que nuestros padres hab an declarado mas ahora para que prevean que el vendr y que se acuerda de toda criatura que ha creado l se manifestar a todos
2681634 s toda rodilla se doblar y toda lengua confesar ante l s en el postrer d a cuando todos los hombres se presenten para ser juzgados por l entonces confesar n que l es dios
2681635 para que sep is de la venida de jesucristo el hijo de dios el padre del cielo y de la tierra el creador de todas las cosas desde el principio
2681636 he aqu soy jesucristo el hijo de dios yo cre los cielos y la tierra y todas las cosas que en ellos hay era con el padre desde el principio yo soy en el padre y el padre es en m y en m ha glorificado el padre su nombre
2681637 he aqu yo soy el que fue preparado desde la fundaci n del mundo para redimir a mi pueblo he aqu soy jesucristo soy el padre y el hijo en m todo el g nero humano tendr vida y la tendr eternamente s aun cuantos crean en mi nombre y llegar n a ser mis hijos y mis hijas
2681638 a causa del convenio que hab is hecho ser is llamados progenie de cristo hijos e hijas de l porque he aqu hoy l os ha engendrado espiritualmente pues dec s que vuestros corazones han cambiado por medio de la fe en su nombre por tanto hab is nacido de l y hab is llegado a ser sus hijos y sus hijas
2681639 he aqu os digo que qui n ha o do las palabras de los profetas s todos los santos profetas que han profetizado concerniente a la venida del se or os digo que todos aquellos que han escuchado sus palabras y cre do que el se or redimir a su pueblo y han esperado anhelosamente ese d a para la remisi n de sus pecados os digo que stos son su posteridad o sea son los herederos del reino de dios
2681640 porque stos son aquellos cuyos pecados l ha tomado sobre s stos son aquellos por quienes ha muerto para redimirlos de sus transgresiones
2681641 me he arrepentido de mis pecados y el se or me ha redimido he aqu he nacido del esp ritu
2681642 y el se or me dijo no te maravilles de que todo el g nero humano s hombres y mujeres toda naci n tribu lengua y pueblo deban nacer otra vez s nacer de dios ser cambiados de su estado carnal y ca do a un estado de rectitud siendo redimidos por dios convirti ndose en sus hijos e hijas
2681643 y as llegan a ser nuevas criaturas y a menos que hagan esto de ning n modo pueden heredar el reino de dios
2681644 clam dentro de mi coraz n oh jes s hijo de dios ten misericordia de m que estoy en la hiel de amargura y ce ido con las eternas cadenas de la muerte
2681645 y he aqu que cuando pens esto ya no me pude acordar m s de mis dolores s dej de atormentarme el recuerdo de mis pecados
2681646 y oh qu gozo y qu luz tan maravillosa fue la que vi
2681647 mis miembros recobraron su fuerza y me puse de pie y manifest al pueblo que hab a nacido de dios
2681648 s y desde ese d a aun hasta ahora he trabajado sin cesar para traer almas al arrepentimiento para traerlas a probar el sumo gozo que yo prob para que tambi n nazcan de dios y sean llenas del esp ritu santo
2681649 porque a causa de la palabra que l me ha comunicado he aqu muchos han nacido de dios y han probado como yo he probado y han visto ojo a ojo como yo he visto por tanto ellos saben acerca de estas cosas de que he hablado como yo s y el conocimiento que tengo viene de dios
2681650 hab is nacido espiritualmente de dios hab is recibido su imagen en vuestros rostros hab is experimentado este gran cambio en vuestros corazones
2681651 han matado a un profeta del se or s un hombre escogido de dios que les habl de sus iniquidades y abominaciones y profetiz de muchas cosas que han de acontecer s aun la venida de cristo
2681652 y porque les declar que cristo era el dios el padre de todas las cosas y que tomar a sobre s la imagen de hombre y ser a la imagen conforme a la cual el hombre fue creado en el principio en otras palabras dijo que el hombre fue creado a imagen de dios y que dios bajar a entre los hijos de los hombres y tomar a sobre s carne y sangre e ir a sobre la faz de la tierra
2681653 y ahora bien porque dijo esto le quitaron la vida
2681654 la expiaci n que dios mismo efectuar por los pecados e iniquidades de los de su pueblo
2681655 dios mismo bajar a entre los hijos de los hombres y tomar a sobre s la forma de hombre e ir a con gran poder sobre la faz de la slide 128 tierra
2681656 dios mismo descender entre los hijos de los hombres y redimir a su pueblo
2681657 y porque morar en la carne ser llamado el hijo de dios habiendo sujetado la carne a la voluntad del padre siendo el padre y el hijo
2681658 y son un dios s el verdadero padre eterno del cielo y de la tierra
2681659 y as la carne habi ndose sujetado al esp ritu o el hijo al padre siendo un dios sufre tentaciones pero no cede a ellas sino que permite que su pueblo se burle de l y lo azote y lo eche fuera y lo repudie
2681660 y tras de todo esto despu s de obrar muchos grandes milagros entre los hijos de los hombres ser conducido s seg n dijo isa as como la oveja permanece muda ante el trasquilador as l no abri su boca
2681661 s aun de este modo ser llevado crucificado y muerto la carne quedando sujeta hasta la muerte la voluntad del hijo siendo absorbida en la voluntad del padre
2681662 y as dios rompe las ligaduras de la muerte habiendo logrado la victoria sobre la muerte dando al hijo poder para interceder por los hijos de los hombres
2681663 cu n grande es la importancia de dar a conocer estas cosas a los habitantes de la tierra para que sepan que ninguna carne puede morar en la presencia de dios sino por medio de los m ritos y misericordia y gracia del santo mes as quien da su vida seg n la carne y la vuelve a tomar por el poder del esp ritu para efectuar la resurrecci n de los muertos siendo el primero que ha de resucitar
2681664 deseo de la carne y la iniquidad que hay en ella que da al esp ritu del diablo el poder de cautivar de hundiros en el infierno a fin de poder reinar sobre vosotros en su propio reino
2681665 he aqu vengo a los m os para cumplir todas las cosas que he dado a conocer a los hijos de los hombres desde la fundaci n del mundo y para hacer la voluntad as la del padre como la del hijo la del padre por causa de m y la del hijo por causa de mi carne he aqu ha llegado el momento y esta noche se dar la se al
2681666 padre si quieres pasa de m esta copa pero no se haga mi voluntad sino la tuya
2681667 la voluntad del hijo siendo absorbida en la voluntad del padre
2681668 la voluntad del hijo siendo absorbida en la voluntad del padre
2681669 todas las otras cosas que pertenecen a nuestra religi n son nicamente dependencias de
2681670 por ad n vino la ca da del hombre y por causa de la ca da del hombre vino jesucristo y a causa de jesucristo vino la redenci n del hombre y a causa de la redenci n del hombre son llevados de vuelta a la presencia del se or
2681671 la v a est preparada desde la ca da del hombre y la salvaci n es gratuita
2681672 fue hecho el primer hombre ad n alma viviente el postrer ad n esp ritu vivificante
2681673 el cordero que fue inmolado desde el principio del mundo
2681674 preparados desde la fundaci n del mundo para todo el g nero humano que ha existido desde la ca da de ad n o que existe o que existir jam s hasta el fin del mundo
2681675 si no hubiese sido por el plan de redenci n que fue establecido desde la fundaci n del mundo no habr a habido resurrecci n de los muertos mas se instituy un plan de redenci n
2681676 le explic las escrituras desde la creaci n de ad n exponi ndole la ca da del hombre y tambi n el plan de redenci n que fue preparado desde la fundaci n del mundo por medio de cristo para cuantos quisieran creer en su nombre
2681677 he aqu yo soy el que fue preparado desde la fundaci n del mundo para redimir al pueblo
2681678 ad n cay para que los hombres existiesen y existen los hombres para que tengan gozo y el mes as vendr en la plenitud de los tiempos a fin de redimir a los hijos de los hombres de la ca da
2681679 cu n grande es la importancia de dar conocer estas cosas a los habitantes de la tierra para que sepan que ninguna carne puede morar en la presencia de dios sino por medio de los m ritos y misericordia y gracia del santo mes as quien da su vida seg n la carne y la vuelve a tomar por el poder del esp ritu para efectuar la resurrecci n de los muertos siendo el primero que ha de resucitar
2681680 de manera que l es las primicias para dios pues l interceder por todos los hijos de los hombres y los que crean en l ser n salvos
2681681 y por motivo de la intercesi n hecha por todos todos los hombres vienen a dios de modo que comparecen ante su presencia para que l los juzgue de acuerdo con la verdad y santidad que hay en l
2681682 hombre obrara por s mismo los hijos de los hombres han llegado a quedar libres para siempre discerniendo el bien del mal para actuar por s mismos y no para que se act e sobre ellos son libres para escoger la libertad y la vida eterna o escoger la cautividad y la muerte
2681683 es preciso que haya una oposici n en todas las cosas
2681684 no habr a habido ning n objeto en la creaci n de la vida humana
2681685 bendito sea el nombre de dios pues a causa de mi trasgresi n se han abierto mis ojos y tendr gozo en esta vida y en la carne de nuevo ver a dios
2681686 de no haber sido por nuestra trasgresi n nunca hubi ramos conocido el bien y el mal ni el gozo de nuestra redenci n ni la vida eterna que dios concede a todos los que son obedientes
2681687 aquella antigua serpiente que enga a nuestros primeros padres que fue la slide 136 causa de su ca da
2681688 si hay un dios por qu hay tanto sufrimiento en el mundo
2681689 hubieran permanecido en el mismo estado en que se hallaban despu s de ser creadas
2681690 en un estado de inocencia sin sentir gozo porque no conoc an la miseria sin hacer lo bueno porque no conoc an el pecado
2681691 y despu s que ad n y eva hubieron comido del fruto prohibido fueron echados del jard n de ed n para cultivar la tierra
2681692 y tuvieron hijos s la familia de toda la tierra
2681693 as como en ad n o por naturaleza ellos caen as tambi n la sangre de cristo exp a sus pecados
2681694 y lo ha sido desde la ca da de ad n y lo ser para siempre jam s a menos que se someta al influjo del santo esp ritu y se despoje del hombre natural y se haga santo por la expiaci n de cristo el se or y se vuelva como un ni o sumiso manso humilde paciente lleno de amor y dispuesto a someterse a cuanto el se or juzgue conveniente imponer sobre l tal como un ni o se somete a su padre
2681695 toda la humanidad lleg a ser carnal sensual y diab lica discerniendo el mal del bien y sujet ndose al diablo
2681696 de modo que toda la humanidad estaba perdida y he aqu se habr a perdido eternamente si dios no hubiese rescatado a su pueblo de su estado ca do y perdido
2681697 pero recordad que quien persiste en su propia naturaleza carnal y sigue las sendas del pecado y la rebeli n contra dios permanece en su estado ca do y el diablo tiene todo poder sobre l por tanto queda como si no se hubiera hecho ninguna redenci n siendo enemigo de dios y tambi n el diablo es enemigo de dios
2681698 oh se or no te enojes con tu siervo a causa de su debilidad delante de ti porque sabemos que t eres santo y habitas en los cielos y que slide 138 somos indignos delante de ti por causa de la ca da nuestra naturaleza se ha tornado mala continuamente
2681699 despoja a los hijos de los hombres de la luz
2681700 seg n la sabidur a de aquel que todo lo sabe
2681701 los d as de los hijos de los hombres fueron prolongados seg n la voluntad de dios para que se arrepintiesen mientras se hallaban en la carne por lo tanto su estado lleg a ser un estado de probaci n y su tiempo fue prolongado conforme a los mandamientos que el se or dios dio a los hijos de los hombres
2681702 y vemos que la muerte viene sobre el g nero humano
2681703 y despu s que dios hubo dispuesto que estas cosas sobrevinieran a los hombres he aqu vio entonces que era necesario que stos supieran acerca de las cosas que l hab a dispuesto para ellos
2681704 y de all en adelante empezaron los hombres a invocar su nombre por tanto dios convers con ellos y les hizo saber del plan de redenci n que se hab a preparado desde la fundaci n del mundo y esto l les manifest seg n su fe y arrepentimiento y sus obras santas
2681705 por tanto despu s de haberles dado a conocer el plan de redenci n dios les dio mandamientos de no cometer iniquidad
2681706 y as dios llam a los hombres en el nombre de su hijo pues ste era el plan de redenci n que se estableci diciendo si os arrepent s y no endurec is vuestros corazones entonces tendr misericordia de vosotros por medio de mi hijo unig nito
2681707 para actuar por s mismos y no para que se act e sobre ellos
2681708 libres para escoger la libertad y la vida eterna por medio del gran mediador de todos los hombres o escoger la cautividad y la muerte seg n la cautividad y el poder del diablo
2681709 quisiera que confiaseis en el gran mediador y que escuchaseis sus grandes mandamientos y sed fieles a sus palabras y escoged la vida eterna seg n la voluntad de su santo esp ritu
2681710 en los ltimos d as de mi probaci n y he escogido la buena parte seg n las palabras del profeta y no tengo ninguna otra intenci n sino el eterno bienestar de vuestras almas
2681711 los m ritos y misericordia y gracia del santo mes as
2681712 yo s que sab is que l se manifestar en la carne a los de jerusal n de donde vinimos porque es propio que sea entre ellos pues conviene que el gran creador se deje someter al hombre en la carne y muera por todos los hombres a fin de que todos los hombres queden sujetos a l
2681713 porque as como la muerte ha pasado sobre todos los hombres para cumplir el misericordioso designio del gran creador tambi n es menester que haya un poder de resurrecci n y la resurrecci n debe venir al hombre por motivo de la ca da y la ca da vino a causa de la trasgresi n y por haber ca do el hombre fue desterrado de la presencia del se or
2681714 por tanto es preciso que sea una expiaci n infinita pues a menos que fuera una expiaci n infinita esta corrupci n no podr a revestirse de incorrupci n de modo que el primer juicio que vino sobre el hombre habr a tenido que permanecer infinitamente y siendo as esta carne tendr a que descender para pudrirse y desmenuzarse en su madre tierra para no levantarse jam s
2681715 s que cristo vendr entre los hijos de los hombres para tomar sobre s las transgresiones de su pueblo y que expiar los pecados del mundo porque el se or dios lo ha dicho
2681716 porque es preciso que haya un gran y postrer sacrificio s no un sacrificio de hombre ni de bestia ni de ning n g nero de ave pues no ser un sacrificio humano sino debe ser un sacrificio infinito y eterno
2681717 y viene al mundo para salvar a todos los hombres si stos escuchan su voz porque he aqu l sufre los dolores de toda criatura viviente tanto hombres como mujeres y ni os que pertenecen a la familia de ad n
2681718 oh la sabidur a de dios su misericordia y gracia
2681719 y nuestros esp ritus habr an llegado a ser como l y nosotros ser amos diablos ngeles de un diablo para ser separados de la presencia de nuestro dios y permanecer con el padre de las mentiras en la miseria como l s iguales a ese ser que enga a nuestros primeros padres quien se transforma casi en un ngel de luz que incita a los hijos de los hombres a combinaciones secretas de asesinato y a toda especie de obras secretas de tinieblas
2681720 oh cu n grande es la bondad de nuestro dios que prepara un medio para que escapemos de las garras de este terrible monstruo s ese monstruo muerte e infierno que llamo la muerte del cuerpo y tambi n la muerte del esp ritu
2681721 oh cu n grande es el plan de nuestro dios
2681722 oh la grandeza de la misericordia de nuestro dios el santo de israel
2681723 oh cu n grande es la santidad de nuestro dios
2681724 y viene al mundo para salvar a todos los hombres si stos escuchan su voz porque he aqu l sufre los dolores de todos los hombres s los dolores de toda criatura viviente tanto hombres como mujeres y ni os que pertenecen a la familia de ad n
2681725 donde no se ha dado ninguna ley no hay castigo y donde no hay castigo no hay condenaci n y donde no hay condenaci n las misericordias del santo de israel tienen derecho a reclamarlos por motivo de la expiaci n porque son librados por el poder de l
2681726 porque la expiaci n satisface lo que su justicia demanda de todos aquellos a quienes no se ha dado la ley
2681727 escucha las palabras de cristo tu redentor tu se or y tu dios he aqu vine al mundo no para llamar a los justos al arrepentimiento sino a los pecadores los sanos no necesitan de m dico sino los que est n enfermos por tanto los ni os peque os son sanos porque son incapaces de cometer pecado por tanto la maldici n de ad n les es slide 144 quitada en mi de modo que no tiene poder sobre ellos y la ley de la circuncisi n se ha abrogado en m
2681728 amado hijo m o s que es una solemne burla ante dios que bautic is a los ni os peque os
2681729 he aqu te digo que esto ense ar s el arrepentimiento y el bautismo a los que son responsables y capaces de cometer pecado s ense a a los padres que deben arrepentirse y ser bautizados y humillarse como sus ni os peque os y se salvar n todos ellos con sus peque itos
2681730 y sus ni os peque os no necesitan el arrepentimiento ni tampoco el bautismo
2681731 mas los ni os peque os viven en cristo aun desde la fundaci n del mundo de no ser as dios es un dios parcial y tambi n un dios variable que hace acepci n de personas porque cu ntos son los peque itos que ha muerto sin el bautismo
2681732 he aqu te digo que el que supone que los ni os peque os tienen necesidad del bautismo se halla en la hiel de la amargura y en las cadenas de la iniquidad porque no tiene fe ni esperanza ni caridad
2681733 los ni os peque os no pueden arrepentirse por consiguiente es una terrible iniquidad negarles las misericordias puras de dios porque todos viven en l por motivo de su misericordia
2681734 porque he aqu todos los ni os peque itos viven en cristo y tambi n todos aquellos que est n sin ley
2681735 antes bien es una burla ante dios el negar las misericordias de cristo y el poder de su santo esp ritu y el poner la confianza en obras muertas
2681736 y aun si fuese posible que los ni os peque os pecasen no podr an salvarse mas te digo que son benditos pues he aqu as como en ad n o por naturaleza ellos caen as tambi n la sangre de cristo exp a sus pecados
2681737 y el ni o que muere en su infancia no perece mas los hombres beben condenaci n para sus propias almas a menos que se humillen y se vuelvan como ni os peque os y crean que la salvaci n fue y es y ha de venir en la sangre expiatoria de cristo el se or omnipotente y por medio de ella
2681738 y he aqu cuando llegue ese d a nadie salvo los ni os peque os ser n hallados sin culpa ante dios sino por el arrepentimiento y la fe en el nombre del se or dios omnipotente
2681739 arrepentimiento y la fe en el nombre del se or dios omnipotente
2681740 l manda a todos los hombres que se arrepientan y se bauticen en su nombre teniendo perfecta fe en el
2681741 y si no se arrepienten ni creen en su nombre ni se bautizan en su nombre ni perseveran hasta el fin deben ser condenados pues el se or dios el santo de israel lo ha dicho
2681742 pero hay de aquel a quien la ley es dada s que tiene todos los mandamientos de dios como nosotros y que los quebranta y malgasta los d as de su probaci n porque su estado es terrible
2681743 y las primicias del arrepentimiento es el bautismo y el bautismo viene por la fe para cumplir los mandamientos y el cumplimiento de los mandamientos trae la remisi n de los pecados
2681744 del hombre natural y hacerse santo por la expiaci n de cristo el se or
2681745 en su propio estado carnal aun menos que el polvo de la tierra
2681746 oh ten misericordia y aplica la sangre expiatoria de cristo para que recibamos el perd n de nuestros pecados y sean purificados nuestros corazones porque creemos en jesucristo el hijo de dios que cre el cielo y la tierra y todas las cosas el cual bajar entre los hijos de los hombres
2681747 os digo que si hab is llegado al conocimiento de la bondad de dios y de su incomparable poder y su sabidur a su paciencia y su longanimidad para con los hijos de los hombres y tambi n la expiaci n que ha sido preparada desde la fundaci n del mundo a fin de que por ese medio llegara la salvaci n a aquel que pusiera su confianza en el se or y fuera diligente en guardar sus mandamientos y perseverar en la fe hasta el fin de su vida quiero decir la vida del cuerpo mortal digo que ste es el hombre que recibe la salvaci n por medio de la expiaci n que fue preparada desde la fundaci n del mundo para todo el g nero humano que ha existido desde la ca da de ad n o que existe o que existir jam s hasta el fin del mundo
2681748 y ste es el medio por el cual viene la salvaci n y no hay otra salvaci n aparte de sta de que se ha hablado ni hay tampoco otras condiciones seg n las cuales el hombre pueda ser salvo sino por las que os he dicho
2681749 ahora pues a causa del convenio que hab is hecho ser is llamados progenie de cristo hijos e hijas de l porque he aqu
2681750 y bajo este t tulo sois librados y no hay otro t tulo por medio del cual pod is ser librados
2681751 y suceder que quien hiciera esto se hallar a la diestra de dios porque sabr el nombre por el cual es llamado pues ser llamado por el nombre de cristo
2681752 ce idos por las ligaduras de la muerte y las cadenas del infierno
2681753 he aqu os digo que el buen pastor os llama s y os llama en su propio nombre el cual es el nombre de cristo y si no quer is dar o dos a la voz del buen pastor al nombre por el cual sois llamados he aqu no sois las ovejas del buen pastor
2681754 s que jesucristo vendr s el hijo el unig nito del padre lleno de gracia de misericordia y de verdad y he aqu l es el que viene a quitar los pecados del mundo s los pecados de todo hombre que crea firmemente en su nombre
2681755 me he arrepentido de mis pecados y el se or me ha redimido he aqu he nacido del esp ritu
2681756 y el se or me dijo no te maravilles de que todo el g nero humano s hombres y mujeres toda naci n tribu lengua y pueblo deban nacer otra vez s nacer de dios ser cambiados de su estado carnal y ca do a un estado de rectitud siendo redimidos por dios convirti ndose en sus hijos e hijas
2681757 despu s de pasar mucha tribulaci n arrepinti ndose casi
2681758 si no hubiese nacido de dios no habr a sabido estas cosas pero por boca de su santo ngel dios me ha hecho saber estas cosas no por dignidad alguna en m
2681759 s y desde ese d a aun hasta ahora he trabajado sin cesar para traer almas al arrepentimiento para traerlas a probar el sumo gozo que yo prob para que tambi n nazcan de dios y sean llenas del esp ritu santo
2681760 porque a causa de la palabra que l me ha comunicado he aqu muchos han nacido de dios y han probado como yo he probado y han visto ojo a ojo como yo he visto
2681761 el hijo de dios padece seg n la carne a fin de tomar sobre s los pecados de su pueblo para borrar sus transgresiones seg n el poder de su redenci n
2681762 deb is arrepentiros y nacer de nuevo pues el esp ritu dice que si no nac is otra vez no pod is heredar el reino de los cielos venid pues y sed bautizados para arrepentimiento a fin de que se is lavados de vuestros pecados para que teng is fe en el cordero de dios que quita los pecados del mundo que es poderoso para salvar y para limpiar de toda iniquidad
2681763 saldr a sufriendo dolores aflicciones y tentaciones de todas clases y esto para que se cumpla la palabra que dice tomar sobre s los dolores y las enfermedades de su pueblo
2681764 y tomar sobre s la muerte para soltar las ligaduras de la muerte que sujetan a su pueblo y sus enfermedades tomara l sobre s para que sus entra as sean llenas de slide 149 misericordia seg n la carne a fin de que seg n la carne sepa c mo socorrer a los de su pueblo de acuerdo con las enfermedades de ellos
2681765 da esfuerzo al cansado y multiplica las fuerzas al que no tiene ningunas y los que esperan a jehov tendr n nuevas fuerzas levantar n alas como las guilas correr n y no se cansar n caminar n y no se fatigar n
2681766 ascendi a lo alto como tambi n descendi debajo de todo por lo que comprendi todas las cosas a fin de que estuviese en todas las cosas la luz de la verdad que da vida a todas las cosas
2681767 en todas las aflicciones de ellos l fue afligido y el ngel de su presencia los salv y en su amor y en su clemencia los redimi los sostuvo y los llev todos los d as de la antig edad
2681768 por tanto persevera en tu camino tus d as son conocidos y tus a os no ser n acortados no temas pues lo que pueda hacer el hombre porque dios estar contigo para siempre jam s
2681769 no hab a medio de redimir al hombre de este estado ca do que l mismo se hab a ocasionado por motivo de su propia desobediencia
2681770 y as vemos que toda la humanidad se hallaba ca da y que estaba en manos de la justicia s la justicia de dios que los somet a para siempre a estar separados de su presencia
2681771 de no haberse dado una ley de que el hombre que asesina debe morir tendr a miedo de morir si matase y tambi n si no hubiese ninguna ley contra el pecado los hombres no tendr an miedo de pecar
2681772 supones t que la misericordia puede robar a la justicia
2681773 y ahora bien os digo hermanos m os que despu s de haber sabido y de haber sido instruidos en todas estas cosas si transgred s y obr is contra lo que se ha hablado de modo que os separ is del esp ritu de se or para que no tenga cabida en vosotros para guiaros por las sendas de la sabidur a a fin de que se is bendecidos prosperados y preservados
2681774 y ahora os digo que la misericordia no puede reclamar a ese hombre por tanto su destino final es padecer un tormento sin fin
2681775 descienda un justo juicio sobre los hijos de los hombres
2681776 los malvados permanecen como si no se hubiese hecho ninguna redenci n a menos que sea el rompimiento de las ligaduras de la muerte
2681777 llevados a comparecer ante el tribunal de cristo el hijo y dios el padre y el santo esp ritu que son un eterno dios para ser juzgados seg n sus obras sean buenas o malas
2681778 empez a temblar sobremanera porque m s y m s se convenc a del poder de la justicia de dios
2681779 no deber ais temblar porque la salvaci n no viene a ninguno de stos por cuanto el se or no ha redimido a ninguno de los tales ni tampoco puede redimirlos porque el se or no puede contradecirse a s mismo pues no puede negar a la justicia cuando sta reclama lo suyo
2681780 todos sus juicios son rectos que l es justo en todas sus obras
2681781 plan de la misericordia que satisfar a las demandas de la justicia y liberar a a los que estuvieran presos del pecado har a falta que un dios mismo descendiera a la tierra para expiar por los pecados del mundo aspecto que abinad destac no una vez sino en tres ocasiones al hablar al rey no y sus inicuos sacerdotes sobre la expiaci n
2681782 no hay hombre alguno que sacrifique su propia sangre la cual exp e los pecados de otros
2681783 que dios sea un dios perfecto y justo y misericordioso tambi n
2681784 mas se ha dado una ley y se ha fijado un castigo y se ha concedido un arrepentimiento el cual la misericordia reclama de otro modo la justicia reclama al ser humano y ejecuta la ley y la ley impone el castigo pues de no ser as las obras de la justicia ser an destruidas y dios dejar a de ser dios
2681785 mas dios no cesa de ser dios y la misericordia reclama al que se arrepiente y la misericordia viene a causa de la expiaci n y la expiaci n lleva afecto la resurrecci n de los muertos y la resurrecci n de los muertos lleva a los hombres de regreso a la presencia de dios y as son restaurados a su presencia para ser juzgados seg n sus obras de acuerdo con la ley y la justicia
2681786 pues he aqu la justicia ejerce todos sus derechos y tambi n la misericordia reclama cuanto le pertenece y as nadie se salva sino los que verdaderamente se arrepienten
2681787 henchidas de misericordia sus entra as lleno de compasi n por los hijos de los hombres interponi ndose entre ellos y la justicia habiendo quebrantado los lazos de la muerte tomado sobre s la iniquidad y las transgresiones de ellos habi ndolos redimido y satisfecho las exigencias de la justicia
2681788 de forma incomprensible y misteriosa jes s asumi la responsabilidad que por naturaleza deber a haber reca do sobre ad n pero que s lo pod a ser llevada a cabo mediante su mediaci n y al tomar sobre s los pesares asumiendo las responsabilidades y soportando las transgresiones o pecados de los hombres en una forma que nos resulta incomprensible e inexplicable tom el peso de los pecados de todo el mundo no s lo de ad n sino de su posteridad y al hacerlo abri el reino del cielo no tanto a los creyentes que hab an obedecido la ley de dios slide 153 como a m s de la mitad de la familia humana que muri antes de llegar a la edad de responsabilidad y tambi n a los paganos quienes habiendo muerto sin ley por medio de su mediaci n resucitar n sin ley y sin sta ser n juzgados y de este modo participar n de las bendiciones de su expiaci n
2681789 la justicia ejerce todos sus derechos y tambi n la misericordia reclama cuanto le pertenece y as nadie se salva sino los que verdaderamente se arrepienten
2681790 sobrepuja a la justicia y as la misericordia satisface las exigencias de la justicia y ci e al que ese arrepiente con brazos de seguridad mientras que aqu l que no ejerce la fe para arrepentimiento queda expuesto a las exigencias de toda la ley de la justicia
2681791 han obrado seg n su propia voluntad y deseos carnales nunca habiendo invocado al se or mientras los brazos de la misericordia se extend an hacia ellos porque los brazos de la misericordia se extendieron hacia ellos y no quisieron habiendo sido amonestados por sus iniquidades y sin embargo no las abandonaron y se les mand arrepentirse y con todo no quisieron arrepentirse
2681792 as pues amados hermanos m os venid al se or el santo
2681793 por lo tanto no gast is dinero en lo que no tiene valor ni vuestro trabajo en lo que no puede satisfacer escuchad diligentemente y recordad las palabras que he hablado y venid al santo de israel y saciaos de lo que no perece ni se puede corromper y del itese vuestra alma en la plenitud
2681794 l no hace nada a menos que sea para el beneficio del mundo porque l ama al mundo al grado de dar su propia vida para traer a todos los hombres a l
2681795 he aqu acaso exclama l a alguien diciendo ap rtate de m
2681796 ha mandado l a alguien que no participe de su salvaci n
2681797 he aqu ha mandado el se or a alguien que no participe de su bondad
2681798 porque ninguna de estas iniquidades viene del se or porque l hace lo que es bueno entre los hijos de los hombres y nada hace que no sea claro para los hijos de los hombres y l invita a todos ellos a que vengan a l y participen de su bondad y a nadie de los que a l vienen desecha sean negros o blancos esclavos o libres varones o mujeres y se acuerda de los paganos y todos son iguales ante dios tanto los jud os como los gentiles
2681799 y he aqu ya que nos ha costado tanto lograr que nos sean quitadas nuestras manchas y que nuestras espadas se vuelvan lustrosas escond moslas a fin de que conserven su brillo como testimonio a nuestro dios en el d a final el d a en que seamos llevados para comparecer ante l para ser juzgados de que no hemos manchado nuestras espadas en la sangre de nuestros hermanos desde que l nos comunic su palabra y nos limpi por ello
2681800 oh se or ten slide 155 misericordia seg n tu abundante misericordia que has tenido para con el pueblo de nefi tenla para mi y mi pueblo
2681801 oh bendito jes s que me ha salvado de un terrible infierno oh dios bendito ten misericordia de este pueblo
2681802 eres misericordioso oh dios porque has o do mi oraci n
2681803 aun cuando me hallaba en el desierto s fuiste misericordioso cuando or concerniente a aquellos que eran mis enemigos y t los volviste a m
2681804 y cuando entr en mi aposento y or a ti oh se or
2681805 s eres misericordioso con tus hijos cuando te invocan para ser o dos de ti y no de los hombres y t los oir s
2681806 s y tambi n me has escuchado cuando mis enemigos me han desechado y despreciado s o ste mis lamentos y se encendi tu enojo contra mis enemigos y los visitaste en tu ira con acelerada destrucci n
2681807 y me o ste por motivo de mis aflicciones y mi sinceridad y es a causa de tu hijo que has sido tan misericordioso conmigo por tanto clamar a ti en todas mis aflicciones porque en ti est mi gozo pues a causa de tu hijo has apartado tus juicios de m
2681808 mientras me atribulaba el recuerdo de mis muchos pecados he aqu tambi n me acord de haber o do a mi padre profetizar al pueblo concerniente a la venida de un jesucristo un hijo de dios para expiar los pecados del mundo
2681809 y al concentrarse mi mente en este pensamiento clam dentro de mi coraz n oh jes s hijo de dios ten misericordia de m que estoy en la hiel de amargura y ce ido con las eternas cadenas de la muerte
2681810 y he aqu que cuando pens esto ya no me puede acordar m s de mis dolores s dej de atormentarme el recuerdo de mis pecados
2681811 y oh qu gozo y qu luz tan maravillosa fue la que vi
2681812 s hijo m o te digo que no pod a haber cosa tan intensa ni tan amarga como mis dolores s hijo m o y tambi n te digo que por otra parte no puede haber cosa tan intensa y dulce como lo fue mi gozo
2681813 durante tres d as y tres noches me vi en el m s amargo dolor y angustia de alma y no fue sino hasta que implor misericordia al se or jesucristo que recib la remisi n de mis pecados pero he aqu clam a l y hall paz para mi alma
2681814 el que quiera venir puede venir a beber libremente de las aguas de la vida
2681815 oh hijo m o quisiera que no negaras m s la justicia de dios
2681816 ve hijo m o declara la palabra con verdad y con circunspecci n para que lleves almas al arrepentimiento a fin de que el gran plan de misericordia pueda reclamarlas
2681817 recordad despu s de haberos reconciliado con dios que tan s lo en la gracia de dios y por ella sois salvos
2681818 ninguna carne puede morar en la presencia de dios sino por medio de los m ritos y misericordia y gracia del santo mes as
2681819 no porque no hab is llegado hasta aqu sino por la palabra de cristo con fe inquebrantable en l confiando ntegramente en los m ritos de aquel que es poderoso para salvar
2681820 la salvaci n no viene s lo por la ley y si no fuera por la expiaci n que dios mismo efectuar por los pecados e iniquidades de los de su pueblo stos inevitablemente perecer an a pesar de la ley de mois s
2681821 an mense pues vuestros corazones y recordad que sois libres para obrar por vosotros mismos para escoger la v a de la muerte interminable o la v a de la vida eterna por tanto mis amados hermanos reconciliaos con la voluntad de dios y no con la voluntad del diablo y la carne y recordad despu s de haberos reconciliado con dios que tan s lo en la gracia de dios y por ella sois salvos as pues dios os levante de la muerte por el poder de la resurrecci n y tambi n de la muerte eterna por el poder de la expiaci n a fin de que se is recibidos en el reino eterno de dios para que lo alab is por medio de la divina gracia
2681822 y si os absten is de toda impiedad y am is a dios con toda vuestra alma mente y fuerza entonces su gracia os es suficiente para que por su gracia se is perfectos en cristo entonces sois santificados en cristo por la gracia de dios mediante el derramamiento de la sangre de cristo
2681823 sabemos que es por la gracia por la que nos salvamos despu s de hacer cuanto podamos
2681824 dar a su vida seg n la carne y la volver a a tomar por el poder del esp ritu para efectuar la resurrecci n de los muertos siendo el primero que ha de resucitar
2681825 pronto ir a descansar en el para so de dios hasta que mi esp ritu y mi cuerpo de nuevo se re nan y sea llevado triunfante por el aire para encontrarnos ante el agradable tribunal del gran jehov el juez eterno de vivos y muertos
2681826 no cre a en lo que se hab a dicho tocante a la resurrecci n de los muertos ni tampoco cre a lo concerniente a la venida de cristo
2681827 si cristo no hubiese resucitado de los muertos o si no hubiese roto las ligaduras de la muerte para que el sepulcro no tuviera victoria ni la muerte aguij n no habr a habido resurrecci n
2681828 se abrir n muchos sepulcros y entregar n un gran n mero de sus muertos y muchos santos se aparecer n a mucho
2681829 se han rebelado contra dios que han sabido slide 159 los mandamientos de dios y no quisieron observarlos
2681830 se ha se alado una poca en que todos se levantar n de los muertos
2681831 transici n del esp ritu o el alma a la felicidad o a la miseria
2681832 los esp ritus de todos los hombres sean buenos o malos son llevados de regreso a ese dios que les dio la vida
2681833 donde descansar n de todas sus aflicciones y de todo cuidado y pena
2681834 el alma ser restaurada al cuerpo y el cuerpo al alma s y todo miembro y coyuntura ser n restablecidos a su cuerpo s ni un cabello de la cabeza se perder sino que todo ser restablecido a su propia y perfecta forma
2681835 el esp ritu y el cuerpo ser n reunidos otra vez en su perfecta forma los miembros as como las coyunturas ser n restaurados a su propia forma tal como nos hallamos ahora y seremos llevados ante dios conociendo tal como ahora conocemos y tendremos un vivo recuerdo de toda nuestra culpa
2681836 pues bien esta restauraci n vendr sobre todos tanto viejos j venes esclavos as como libres varones as como mujeres malvados as como justos y no se perder ni un solo pelo de su cabeza sino que todo ser restablecido a su perfecta forma o en el cuerpo cual se encuentra ahora y ser n llevados a comparecer ante el tribunal de cristo el hijo y dios el padre y el santo esp ritu que son un eterno dios para ser juzgados seg n sus obras sean buenas o malas
2681837 y as hijo m o todos los hombres que se hallan en un estado natural o m s bien dir a en un estado carnal est n en la hiel de amargura y en las ligaduras de la iniquidad se encuentran sin dios en el mundo y han obrado en contra de la naturaleza de dios por tanto se hallan en un estado que es contrario a la naturaleza de la felicidad
2681838 y he aqu significa la palabra restauraci n tomar una cosa de un estado natural y colocarla en un estado innatural o sea ponerla en una condici n que se opone a su naturaleza
2681839 oh hijo m o tal no es el caso sino que el significado de la palabra restauraci n es volver de nuevo mal por mal o carnal por carnal o diab lico por diab lico bueno por lo que es bueno recto por lo que es recto misericordioso por lo que es misericordioso
2681840 s la misericordia te ser restablecida de nuevo la justicia te ser restaurada otra vez se te restituir un justo juicio nuevamente y se te recompensar de nuevo con lo bueno
2681841 porque lo que de ti salga volver otra vez a ti y te ser restituido por tanto la palabra restauraci n condena al pecador m s plenamente y en nada lo justifica
2681842 ahora bien he aqu te he hablado concerniente a la muerte del cuerpo mortal y tambi n acerca de la resurrecci n del cuerpo mortal te digo que este cuerpo terrenal se levanta como cuerpo inmortal es decir de la muerte s de la primera muerte a vida de modo que no pueden morir ya m s sus esp ritus se unir n a sus cuerpos para no ser separados nunca m s por lo que esta uni n se torna espiritual e inmortal para no volver a ver corrupci n
2681843 el hombre es esp ritu los elementos son eternos y esp ritu y elemento inseparablemente unidos definici n de la resurrecci n reciben una plenitud de gozo y cuando est n separados el hombre no puede recibir una plenitud de gozo
2681844 el esp ritu y el cuerpo son el alma del hombre y la resurrecci n de los muertos es la redenci n del alma
2681845 el esp ritu y el cuerpo es singular restaurado de nuevo a s mismo singular y todos los hombres se tornan incorruptibles e inmortales y son almas vivientes
2681846 hall ndose vestidos de pureza s con el manto de rectitud
2681847 una plenitud y continuaci n de las simientes por siempre jam s
2681848 diablos ngeles de un diablo para ser separados de la presencia de nuestro dios y permanecer con el padre de las mentiras en la miseria como l
2681849 oh la grandeza de la misericordia de nuestro dios el santo de israel pues l libra a sus santos de ese terrible monstruo el diablo y muerte e infierno
2681850 asombro me da el amor que me da jes s
2681851 si las estrellas s lo aparecieran una noche cada mil a os c mo creer an y adorar an los hombres
2681852 y sucedi que hubo densa oscuridad sobre la faz de la tierra de tal manera que los habitantes que no hab an ca do pod an sentir el vapor de tinieblas
2681853 y no se ve a luz alguna ni fuego ni vislumbre ni el sol ni la luna ni las estrellas por ser tan densos los vapores de oscuridad que hab a sobre la faz de la tierra
2681854 y sucedi que dur por espacio de tres d as de modo que no se vio ninguna luz y hubo grandes lamentaciones gritos y llantos continuamente entre todo el pueblo s grandes fueron los gemidos del pueblo por motivo de las tinieblas y la gran destrucci n que les hab a sobrevenido
2681855 he aqu a mi hijo amado en quien me complazco en quien he glorificado mi nombre a l o d
2681856 yo soy jesucristo de quien los profetas testificaron que vendr a al mundo
2681857 soy la luz y la vida del mundo y he bebido de la amarga copa que el padre me ha dado y he glorificado al padre tomando sobre m los pecados del mundo con lo cual me he sometido a la voluntad del padre desde el principio
2681858 y cuando jes s hubo hablado estas palabras toda la multitud cay al suelo
2681859 ese d a y esa noche y otro d a que ser an como un solo d a como si no hubiera noche a fin de saber que su fe no hab a sido en vano
2681860 aplicar la pena de muerte a todos aquellos que creyeran en esas tradiciones a menos que se verificase la se al
2681861 fue y se postr en tierra y clam fervorosamente a su dios a favor de su pueblo s aquellos que estaban a punto de ser destruidos por motivo de su fe en la tradici n de sus padres
2681862 alza la cabeza y s de buen nimo pues he aqu ha llegado el momento y esta noche se dar la se al y ma ana vengo al mundo para mostrar al
2681863 he aqu vengo a los m os para cumplir todas las cosas que he dado a conocer a los hijos de los hombres desde la fundaci n del mundo y para hacer la voluntad as la del padre como la del hijo la del padre por causa de m y la del hijo por causa de mi carne he aqu ha llegado el momento y esta noche se dar la se al
2681864 por motivo de la se al que se hab a dado y aconteci tambi n que apareci una nueva estrella de acuerdo con la palabra
2681865 no hubo contenciones con excepci n de unos pocos que empezaron a predicar intentando probar por medio de las escrituras que ya no era necesario observar la ley de mois s mas en esto erraron por no haber entendido las escrituras
2681866 el pueblo comenz a olvidarse de aquellas se ales y prodigios que hab a presenciado y a asombrarse cada vez menos de una se al o prodigio del cielo de tal modo que comenzaron a endurecer sus corazones y a cegar sus mentes y a no creer todo lo que hab an visto y o do imagin ndose alguna cosa vana en sus corazones que aquello se efectuaba por los hombres y por el poder del diablo para extraviar y enga ar el coraz n del pueblo de este modo satan s de nuevo se apoder del coraz n de los del pueblo al grado que les ceg los ojos y los condujo a creer que la doctrina de cristo era una cosa insensata y vana
2681867 no hubo alma viviente entre todo el pueblo de los nefitas que dudara en lo m s m nimo de las palabras que todos los santos profetas hab an hablado porque sab an que era necesario que se cumplieran
2681868 y sab an que era menester que cristo hubiese venido por motivo de las muchas se ales que se hab an dado de acuerdo con las palabras de los profetas
2681869 por tanto abandonaron todos sus pecados y sus abominaciones y sus fornicaciones y sirvieron a dios con toda diligencia de d a y de noche
2681870 no hab a nada en toda la tierra que impidiera que el pueblo prosperase continuamente a no ser que cayeran en transgresi n
2681871 empez a deshacerse la iglesia s a tal grado que en el a o treinta se deshizo la iglesia en toda la tierra con excepci n de entre unos pocos lamanitas que se hab an convertido a la verdadera fe y no quisieron separarse de ella
2681872 no pecaban en la ignorancia porque conoc an la voluntad de dios tocante a ellos pues se la hab an ense ado de modo que se rebelaban intencionalmente contra dios
2681873 o en otros t rminos la resurrecci n de cristo y testificaron intr pidamente acerca de su muerte y sus padecimientos
2681874 habi ndosele dado poder para saber concerniente al ministerio de cristo
2681875 y aconteci que se enojaron con l s porque ten a mayor poder que ellos pues no era posible que descreyeran sus palabras pues tan grande era su fe en el se or jesucristo que ngeles le administraban diariamente
2681876 y en el nombre de jes s echaba fuera demonios y esp ritus inmundos y a n levant a un hermano suyo de los muertos y tambi n obr l muchos otros milagros en el nombre de jes s a la vista del pueblo
2681877 como jam s se hab a conocido en toda la tierra
2681878 el diablo se r e y sus ngeles se regocijan a causa de la muerte de los bellos hijos e hijas
2681879 oh vosotros todos los que hab is sido preservados porque fuisteis m s justos que ellos no os volver is a m ahora y os arrepentir is de vuestros pecados y os convertir is para que yo os sane
2681880 s en verdad os digo que si ven s a m tendr is vida eterna
2681881 vine a los m os y los m os no me recibieron
2681882 y vosotros ya no me ofrecer is m s el derramamiento de sangre s vuestros sacrificios y vuestros holocaustos cesar n porque no aceptar ninguno de vuestros sacrificios y vuestros holocaustos
2681883 y me ofrecer is como sacrificio un coraz n quebrantado y un esp ritu contrito
2681884 he aqu he venido al mundo para traer redenci n al mundo para salvar al mundo del pecado
2681885 por tanto al que se arrepintiere y viniere a m como un ni o peque ito yo lo recibir porque de los tales es el reino de dios he aqu por stos he dado mi vida y la he vuelto a tomar as pues arrepent os y venid a m vosotros extremos de la tierra y sed salvos
2681886 por stos he dado mi vida y la he vuelto a tomar
2681887 levantaos y venid a m para que met is vuestras manos en mi costado y para que tambi n palp is las marcas de los clavos en mis manos y en mis pies a fin de que sep is que yo soy el dios de israel y el dios de toda la tierra y que he sido muerto por los pecados del mundo
2681888 vieron con los ojos y palparon con las manos y supieron con certeza y dieron testimonio de que era l de quien hab an escrito los profetas que hab a de venir
2681889 entonces los sumergir is en el agua y saldr is del agua
2681890 y no habr disputas entre vosotros como hasta ahora ha habido ni habr disputas entre vosotros concernientes a los puntos de mi doctrina como hasta aqu las ha habido
2681891 aquel que tiene el esp ritu de contenci n no es m o sino es del diablo que es el padre de la contenci n y l irrita los corazones de los hombres para que contiendan con ira unos con otros
2681892 he aqu sta no es mi doctrina agitar con ira el coraz n de los hombres el uno contra el otro antes bien mi doctrina es sta que se acaben tales cosas
2681893 y sta es mi doctrina y es la doctrina que el padre me ha dado
2681894 y cualquiera que crea en m y sea bautizado ste ser salvo y son ellos los que heredar n el reino de dios
2681895 y quien no crea en m ni sea bautizado ser condenado
2681896 de cierto de cierto os digo que sta es mi doctrina
2681897 deb is arrepentiros y volveros como un ni o peque ito y ser bautizados en mi nombre o de ninguna manera
2681898 de cierto de cierto os digo que sta es mi doctrina y los que edifican sobre esto edifican sobre mi roca y las puertas del infierno no prevalecer n en contra de ellos
2681899 y quienes declaren m s o menos que esto y lo establezcan como mi doctrina tales proceden del mal y no est n fundados sobre mi roca
2681900 bienaventurados sois si prest is atenci n a las palabras de estos doce que yo he escogido de entre vosotros para ejercer su ministerio en bien de vosotros y ser vuestros siervos y a ellos les he dado poder para que os bauticen en el agua y despu s que se is bautizados en el agua he aqu os bautizar is con fuego y con el esp ritu santo
2681901 y tambi n m s bienaventurados son aquellos que crean en vuestras palabras por raz n de que testificar is que me hab is visto y que sab is que yo soy as bienaventurados son los que crean en vuestras palabras y desciendan a lo profundo de la humildad y sean bautizados porque ser n visitados con fuego y con el esp ritu santo y recibir n una remisi n de sus pecados
2681902 que vienen a m porque de ellos es el reino de los cielos
2681903 una escuela de maestros y l deres de la iglesia
2681904 la nueva ley de dios dada en una monta a r plica de la ley concedida a mois s en el monte sina con una estructura dividida en cinco partes a imitaci n de los cinco libros del pentateuco
2681905 y aconteci que cuando jes s hubo hablado estas palabras mir hacia los doce que hab a elegido y les dijo acordaos de las palabras que he hablado
2681906 mirad las aves del cielo pues no siembran ni tampoco siegan ni recogen en alfol es sin embargo vuestro padre celestial las alimenta
2681907 qui n de vosotros por mucho que se afane podr a adir un codo a su estatura
2681908 por tanto si dios viste as la hierba del campo que hoy es y ma ana se echa en el horno as os vestir l si vosotros no sois de poca fe
2681909 no os afan is pues diciendo qu comeremos o qu beberemos o con qu nos hemos de vestir
2681910 porque vuestro padre celestial sabe que ten is necesidad de todas estas cosas
2681911 mas buscad primeramente el reino de dios y su justicia y todas estas cosas os ser n a adidas
2681912 as que no os afan is por el d a de ma ana porque el d a de ma ana traer su af n por sus propias cosas basta el d a para su propio mal
2681913 cuando jes s hubo hablado estas palabras a los doce disc pulos se volvi de nuevo hacia la multitud y abri otra vez su boca
2681914 se ha cumplido la ley que fue dada a mois s he aqu soy yo quien di la ley y soy el que hice convenio con mi pueblo israel por tanto la ley se cumple en m porque he venido para cumplir la ley por tanto tiene fin
2681915 las otras tribus de la casa de israel que el padre ha conducido fuera de su tierra
2681916 por motivo de la obstinaci n y la incredulidad no comprendieron mi palabra por tanto me mand el padre que no les dijese m s tocante a esto
2681917 a n tengo muchas cosas que deciros pero ahora no las pod is sobrellevar
2681918 vosotros sois aquellos de quienes dije tengo otras ovejas que no son de este redil aqu llas tambi n debo yo traer y oir n mi voz y habr un reba o y un pastor
2681919 y no me comprendieron porque pensaron que eran los gentiles porque no entendieron que por medio de su predicaci n los gentiles se convertir an
2681920 ni me entendieron que dije que oir n mi voz ni me comprendieron que los gentiles en ning n tiempo habr an de o r mi voz que no me manifestar a a ellos sino por el esp ritu santo
2681921 mas he aqu vosotros hab is o do mi voz y tambi n me hab is visto y sois mis ovejas y contados sois entre los que el padre me ha dado
2681922 tengo otras ovejas que no son de esta tierra ni de la tierra de jerusal n ni de ninguna de las partes de esa tierra circundante donde he estado para ejercer mi ministerio porque aquellos de slide 176 quienes hablo son los que todav a no han o do mi voz ni en ning n tiempo me he manifestado a ellos
2681923 mas he recibido el mandamiento del padre de que vaya a ellos para que oigan mi voz y sean contados entre mis ovejas a fin de que haya un reba o y un pastor por tanto voy para manifestarme a ellos
2681924 y os mando que escrib is estas palabras despu s que me vaya para que si se da el caso de que mi pueblo en jerusal n aquellos que me han visto y han estado conmigo en mi ministerio no le piden al padre en mi nombre recibir conocimiento por medio del esp ritu santo acerca de vosotros como tambi n de las otras tribus de las cuales nada saben estas palabras que escrib is se preserven y sean manifestadas a los gentiles para que mediante la plenitud de los gentiles el resto de la posteridad de aqu llos que ser esparcido sobre la faz de la tierra a causa de su incredulidad sea recogido o sea llevado al conocimiento de m su redentor
2681925 entonces los reunir de las cuatro partes de la tierra y entonces cumplir el convenio que el padre ha hecho con todo el pueblo de la casa de israel
2681926 heridos y afligidos y muertos y echados de entre ellos y aborrecidos por ellos y sean entre ellos objeto de escarnio y oprobio
2681927 los gentiles pecan contra mi evangelio y rechazan la plenitud de mi evangelio
2681928 he aqu dice el padre retirar la plenitud de mi evangelio de entre ellos y entonces recordar mi convenio que he concertado con los de mi pueblo oh casa de israel y les llevar mi evangelio
2681929 pedid al padre en mi nombre que pod is entender y preparad vuestras mentes para ma ana y vendr a vosotros otra vez
2681930 y tambi n voy a mostrarme a las tribus perdidas de israel porque no est n perdidas para el padre pues l sabe a d nde las ha llevado
2681931 fijamente como si le quisieran pedir que permaneciese un poco m s con ellos
2681932 he aqu mis entra as rebosan de compasi n por vosotros
2681933 y los san a todos seg n se los llevaban
2681934 se postraron a sus pies y lo adoraron y cuantos por la multitud pudieron acercarse le besaron los pies al grado de que le ba aron los pies con sus l grimas
2681935 gimi dentro de s y dijo padre turbado estoy por causa de la iniquidad del pueblo de la casa de israel
2681936 las cosas que or no se pueden escribir y los de la multitud que lo oyeron dieron testimonio
2681937 y de esta manera testifican jam s el ojo ha visto ni el o do escuchado antes de ahora tan grandes y maravillosas cosas como las que vimos y o mos que jes s habl al padre
2681938 y cuando hubo dicho estas palabras llor y tom a sus ni os peque os uno por uno y los bendijo y rog al padre por ellos y cuando hubo hecho esto llor de nuevo y habl a la multitud y les dijo mirad a vuestros peque itos
2681939 cual si fuera en medio de fuego y bajaron y cercaron a aquellos peque itos y fueron rodeados de fuego y los ngeles les ministraron y la multitud vio y oy y dio testimonio y saben que su testimonio es verdadero porque todos ellos vieron y oyeron cada cual por s mismo
2681940 a los de mi iglesia a todos los que crean y se bauticen en mi nombre y siempre procurar is hacer esto tal como yo lo he hecho as como he partido pan y lo he bendecido y os lo he dado y har is esto en memoria de mi cuerpo que os he mostrado y ser un testimonio al padre de que siempre os acord is de m y si os acord is siempre de m tendr is mi esp ritu para que est con vosotros

2681942 deb is velar y orar siempre no sea que el diablo os tiente y se is llevados cautivos por l
2681943 he aqu yo soy la luz yo os he dado el ejemplo
2681944 deb is velar y orar siempre porque satan s desea poseeros para zarandearos como a trigo por tanto siempre deb is orar al padre en mi nombre y cualquier cosa que pid is al padre en mi nombre si es justa creyendo que recibir is he aqu os ser concedida orad al padre en vuestras familias siempre en mi nombre para que sean bendecidos vuestras esposas y vuestros hijos
2681945 he aqu yo soy la luz que deb is sostener en alto aquello que me hab is visto hacer he aqu hab is visto que he orado al padre y todos vosotros hab is sido testigos
2681946 os doy estos mandamientos por motivo de las disputas que ha habido entre nosotros y benditos sois si no hubiere disputas entre vosotros
2681947 se divulg inmediatamente entre el pueblo antes que llegara la noche que la multitud hab a visto a jes s y que l hab a ejercido su ministerio entre ellos y que por la ma ana otra vez se iba a mostrar a la multitud
2681948 hubo muchos s un n mero extremadamente grande que trabajaron afanosamente toda la noche para poder estar a la ma ana siguiente en el paraje donde jes s se iba a mostrar a la multitud
2681949 sin variar en nada las palabras que jes s hab a hablado
2681950 y oraron por lo que m s deseaban y su deseo era que les fuese dado el esp ritu santo
2681951 el esp ritu santo descendi sobre ellos y fueron llenos del esp ritu santo y de fuego
2681952 se apart de entre ellos y se alej de ellos un poco y se inclin a tierra
2681953 padre gracias te doy porque has dado el esp ritu santo a stos que he escogido
2681954 y es por su creencia en m que los he escogido de entre el mundo
2681955 padre te ruego que des el esp ritu santo a todos los que crean en sus palabras
2681956 padre les has dado el esp ritu santo porque creen en m y ves que creen en m porque los oyes y oran a m y oran a m porque estoy con ellos
2681957 y ahora padre te ruego por ellos y tambi n por todos aquellos que han de creer en sus palabras para que crean en m para que yo sea en ellos como t padre eres en m para que seamos uno
2681958 ves que slide 183 creen en m por que los oyes
2681959 y no multiplicaban muchas palabras porque les era manifestado lo que deb an suplicar y estaban llenos de anhelo
2681960 pues qu hemos de pedir como conviene no lo sabemos pero el esp ritu mismo intercede por nosotros con gemidos indecibles
2681961 jes s los bendijo y la sonrisa de su faz fue sobre ellos y los ilumin la luz de su semblante
2681962 su blancura exced a a toda blancura s no pod a haber sobre la tierra cosa tan blanca como su blancura y jes s les dijo seguid orando y ellos no cesaban de orar
2681963 padre te doy las gracias por haber purificado a los que he escogido por causa de su fe y ruego por ellos y tambi n por los que han de creer en sus palabras para que sean purificados en m mediante la fe en sus palabras as como ellos son purificados en m
2681964 padre no te ruego por el mundo sino por los que me has dado del mundo a causa de su fe para que sean purificados en m para que yo sea en ellos como t padre eres en m para que seamos uno para que yo sea glorificado en ellos
2681965 la lengua no puede expresar las palabras que or ni pueden ser escritas por hombre alguno las palabras que or
2681966 no obstante tan grandes y slide 184 maravillosas fueron las palabras que or que no pueden ser escritas ni tampoco puede el hombre expresarlas
2681967 ni los disc pulos ni la multitud hab an llevado pan y vino pero verdaderamente les dio de comer pan y de deber vino tambi n
2681968 mas l pas por en medio de ellos y se fue
2681969 el que come de este pan come de mi cuerpo para su alma y el que bebe de este vino bebe de mi sangre para su alma y su alma nunca tendr hambre y sed sino que ser llena
2681970 llenos del esp ritu y clamaron a una voz y dieron gloria a jes s a quien ve an y o an

2681999 si alguno conspirare contra ti lo har sin m el que contra ti conspirare delante de ti caer
2682000 que muchos santos se levantaron y se aparecieron a muchos y les ministraron y nefi se acord de que aquello no se hab a escrito
2682001 estas escrituras que no hab is tenido con vosotros el padre mand que yo os las diera porque en su sabidur a dispuso que se dieran a las generaciones futuras
2682002 empez a citar las profec as del antiguo testamento primero cit parte del tercer cap tulo de malaqu as y tambi n el cuarto y ltimo cap tulo de la misma profec a aunque variando un poco de la forma en que se halla en nuestra biblia
2682003 he aqu yo env o mi mensajero el cual preparar el camino delante de m y vendr s bitamente a su templo el se or a quien vosotros busc is y el ngel del pacto a quien dese is vosotros
2682004 y qui n podr soportar el tiempo de su venida o qui n podr estar en pie cuando l se manifieste porque l es como fuego purificador y como jab n de lavadores y se sentar para afinar y limpiar la plata porque limpiar a los hijos de lev y traer n a jehov ofrenda en justicia
2682005 en su santo templo un libro que contenga el registro de nuestros muertos el cual sea digno de toda aceptaci n
2682006 vuestras unciones y lavamientos y vuestros bautismos por los muertos y vuestras asambleas solemnes y memoriales para vuestros sacrificios por medio de los hijos de lev
2682007 sobre vosotros mis consiervos en el nombre del mes as confiero el sacerdocio de aar n el cual tiene las llaves del ministerio de ngeles y del evangelio de arrepentimiento y del bautismo por inmersi n para la remisi n de pecados y este sacerdocio nunca m s ser quitado de la tierra hasta que los hijos de lev de nuevo ofrezcan al se or un sacrificio en rectitud
2682008 y vendr a vosotros para juicio y ser pronto testigo
2682009 vuestras palabras contra m han sido violentas dice jehov hab is dicho por dem s es servir a dios qu aprovecha que guardemos su ley y que andemos afligidos en presencia de jehov de los ej rcitos decimos pues ahora bienaventurados son los soberbios y los que hacen impiedad no s lo son prosperados sino que tentaron a dios y escaparon y fue escrito libro de memoria delante de l para los que temen a jehov y para los que piensan en su nombre y ser n para m especial tesoro ha dicho jehov de los ej rcitos en el d a en que yo act e entonces os volver is y discernir is la diferencia entre el justo y el malo entre el que sirve a dios y el que no le sirve
2682010 hace salir su sol sobre los malos y sobre los buenos
2682011 porque he aqu viene el d a ardiente como un horno y todos los soberbios y todos los que hacen maldad ser n estopa
2682012 como el hombre que perdona a su hijo que le sirve
2682013 he aqu yo os env o el profeta el as antes que venga el d a de jehov grande y terrible el har volver el coraz n de los padres hacia los hijos y el coraz n de los hijos hacia los padres no sea que yo venga y hiera la tierra con maldici n
2682014 toda la tierra ser a totalmente asolada a su venida
2682015 en su sabidur a dispuso que se dieran a las generaciones futuras
2682016 todas las cosas aun desde el principio hasta la poca en que l viniera en su gloria
2682017 no puede escribirse en este libro ni la cent sima parte de las cosas que jes s verdaderamente ense al pueblo
2682018 la menor parte de lo que cristo ense al pueblo y que l hab a escrito ser a de valor cuando saliera entre los gentiles
2682019 pero el se or lo prohibi diciendo pondr a prueba la fe de mi pueblo
2682020 ense y ministr a los ni os de la multitud de que se ha hablado y solt la lengua de ellos y declararon cosas grandes y maravillosas a sus padres mayores aun que las que l hab a revelado al pueblo y desat la lengua de ellos de modo que pudieron expresarse
2682021 mayores aun que las que l hab a revelado al pueblo
2682022 volvi al padre despu s de haber sanado a todos sus enfermos y sus cojos y abierto los ojos de los ciegos y destapado los o dos de los sordos y aun hab a efectuado toda clase de sanidades entre ellos y resucitado a un hombre de entre los muertos y manifestado a ellos su poder
2682023 el se or verdaderamente ense al pueblo por espacio de tres d as y tras esto se les manifestaba con frecuencia y part a pan a menudo y lo bendec a y se lo daba
2682024 abrieron su boca y hablaron cosas maravillosas y las cosas que dijeron se prohibi que hombre alguno las escribiera
2682025 vieron y oyeron cosas indecibles que no es l cito escribir
2682026 ense aron y se ministraron el uno al otro y ten an todas las cosas en com n todo hombre obrando en justicia uno con otro y sucedi que hicieron todas las cosas as como jes s se lo hab a mandado
2682027 andaban viajando y predicando las cosas que hab an o do y visto
2682028 cu l deber a ser el nombre de la iglesia
2682029 cualquier cosa que hag is la har is en mi nombre
2682030 de modo que dar is mi nombre a la iglesia
2682031 c mo puede ser mi iglesia salvo que lleve mi nombre
2682032 entonces es mi iglesia si es que est n fundados sobre mi evangelio
2682033 si es que la iglesia est edificada sobre mi evangelio entonces el padre manifestar sus propias obras en ella
2682034 as se llamar mi iglesia en los postreros d as a saber la iglesia de jesucristo de los santos de los ltimos d as
2682035 y en mi nombre pedir is al padre que bendiga a la iglesia por mi causa
2682036 mi padre me envi para que fuese levantado sobre la cruz y que despu s de ser levantado sobre la cruz
2682037 pudiese atraer a m mismo a todos los hombres para que as como he sido levantado por los hombres as tambi n los hombres sean levantados por el padre para comparecer ante m
2682038 y por esta raz n he sido levantado por consiguiente de acuerdo con el poder del padre atraer a m mismo a todos los hombres para que sean juzgados seg n sus obras
2682039 cualquiera que se arrepienta y se bautice en mi nombre ser lleno del esp ritu santo
2682040 y aquel que no persevera hasta el fin ste es el que tambi n es cortado y echado en el fuego
2682041 nada impuro puede entrar en su reino por tanto nada entra en su reposo sino aquellos que han lavado sus vestidos en mi sangre mediante su fe y el arrepentimiento de todos sus pecados y su fidelidad hasta el fin
2682042 someternos a cuanto el se or juzgue conveniente imponer sobre nosotros
2682043 ste es mi evangelio y vosotros sab is las cosas que deb is hacer en mi iglesia pues las obras que me hab is visto hacer sas tambi n las har is porque aquello que me hab is visto hacer eso har is vosotros
2682044 por lo tanto qu clase de hombres hab is de ser
2682045 qu es lo que dese is de m despu s que haya ido al padre
2682046 vivir n para ver todos los hechos del padre para con los hijos de los hombres
2682047 y se les prohibi hablar ni tampoco les fue dado el poder para declarar las cosas que vieron y oyeron
2682048 a fin de que no padeciesen dolor ni pesar sino por los pecados del mundo de modo que satan s no tuviera poder sobre ellos para que no pudiera tentarlos y fueron santificados en la carne a fin de que fuesen santos y no los pudiesen contener los poderes de la tierra
2682049 en el reino del padre para nunca m s salir sino para morar con dios eternamente en los cielos
2682050 son como los ngeles de dios y si ruegan al padre en el nombre de
2682051 volver la mano derecha del se or a la izquierda
2682052 o d oh gentiles y escuchad las palabras de jesucristo el hijo del dios viviente las cuales l me ha mandado que hable concerniente a vosotros pues he aqu l me manda escribir diciendo
2682053 tornaos todos vosotros gentiles de vuestros caminos de maldad y arrepent os de vuestras obras malas de vuestras mentiras y enga os y de vuestras fornicaciones y de vuestras abominaciones secretas y vuestras idolatr as y vuestros asesinatos y vuestras supercher as sacerdotales y vuestras envidias y vuestras contiendas y de todas vuestras iniquidades y abominaciones y venid a m y sed bautizados en mi nombre para que recib is la remisi n de vuestros pecados y se is llenos del esp ritu santo para que se is contados entre los de mi pueblo que son de la casa de israel
2682054 establecieron una iglesia de cristo en todas las tierras circunvecinas
2682055 y ten an en com n todas las cosas por tanto no hab a ricos ni pobres esclavos ni libres sino que todos fueron hechos libres y participantes del don celestial
2682056 sanaban a los enfermos y resucitaban a los muertos y hac an que los cojos anduvieran y que los ciegos recibieran su vista y que los sordos oyeran
2682057 y no obraban milagros salvo que fuera en el nombre de jes s
2682058 de acuerdo con la multitud de las promesas que el se or les hab a hecho
2682059 se guiaban por los mandamientos que hab an recibido de su se or y su dios perseverando en el ayuno y en la oraci n y reuni ndose a menudo tanto para orar como para escuchar la palabra del se or
2682060 a causa del amor de dios que moraba en el coraz n del pueblo
2682061 no hab a envidias ni contiendas ni tumultos ni fornicaciones ni mentiras ni asesinatos ni lascivias de ninguna especie
2682062 ciertamente no pod a haber un pueblo m s dichoso entre todos los que hab an sido creados por la mano de dios
2682063 uno hijos de cristo y herederos del reino de dios
2682064 y cu n bendecidos fueron porque el se or los bendijo en todas sus obras
2682065 una peque a parte del pueblo se hab a rebelado contra la iglesia
2682066 empez a haber entre ellos algunos que se ensalzaron en el orgullo tal como el lucir ropas costosas y toda clase de perlas finas y de las cosas lujosas del mundo y de ah en adelante ya no tuvieron sus bienes y posesiones en com n entre ellos y empezaron a dividirse en clases y empezaron a establecer iglesias para s con objeto de lucrar y comenzaron a negar la verdadera iglesia de cristo
2682067 y administraban lo que era sagrado a quienes les estaba prohibido por motivo de no ser dignos
2682068 empezaron a tener orgullo en su coraz n a causa de sus inmensas riquezas y se envanecieron igual que sus hermanos los lamanitas
2682069 acumulaban y guardaban oro y plata en abundancia y traficaban en mercader as de toda clase
2682070 como uno que clamaba de entre los muertos s como uno que hablaba desde el polvo
2682071 desde que he sido capaz de observar las v as de los hombres ha estado delante de mis ojos una escena continua de maldades y abominaciones
2682072 y ay de m por causa de sus iniquidades porque mi coraz n se ha visto lleno de pesar por raz n de sus maldades todos mis d as
2682073 cubierta de edificios y los habitantes eran casi tan numerosos como las arenas del mar
2682074 el se or retir a sus amados disc pulos los tres nefitas trasladados y ces la obra de milagros y sanidades debido a la iniquidad del pueblo
2682075 y no hubo dones del se or y el esp ritu santo no descendi sobre ninguno por causa de su iniquidad e incredulidad
2682076 fue visitado por el se or y prob y conoci la bondad de jes s
2682077 nadie pod a conservar lo que era suyo por motivo de los ladrones y los bandidos y los asesinos y las artes m gicas y las brujer as que hab a en la tierra
2682078 pesar de los condenados porque el se or no siempre iba a permitirles que hallasen felicidad en el pecado
2682079 y no ven an a jes s con corazones quebrantados y esp ritus contritos antes bien maldec an a dios y deseaban morir
2682080 vi que el d a de gracia hab a pasado para ellos tanto temporal como espiritualmente
2682081 amontonados como esti rcol sobre la superficie de la tierra
2682082 la fuerza del se or no estaba con nosotros s nos vimos abandonados a tal grado que el esp ritu del se or no moraba en nosotros por tanto nos hab amos vuelto d biles como nuestros hermanos
2682083 clama a este pueblo arrepent os y venid a m y sed bautizados y estableced de nuevo mi iglesia y ser is preservados
2682084 pero fue en vano y no comprendieron que era el se or el que los hab a librado y les hab a concedido una oportunidad para arrepentirse y he aqu endurecieron sus corazones contra el se or su dios
2682085 toda alma que pertenece a la familia humana de ad n
2682086 comparecer ante el tribunal de cristo para ser juzgada por sus obras ya sean buenas o malas
2682087 yo morm n no deseo atormentar las almas de los hombres pint ndoles tan terrible escena de sangre y mortandad que se present ante mis ojos pero escribo por lo tanto un breve compendio no atrevi ndome a dar cuenta completa de las cosas que he visto por motivo del mandamiento que he recibido y tambi n para que no os aflij is demasiado por la iniquidad de este pueblo
2682088 porque s que ellos sentir n pesar por la calamidad de la casa de israel s se afligir n por la destrucci n de este pueblo se lamentar n de que este pueblo no se hubiera arrepentido para ser recibido en los brazos de jes s
2682089 el esp ritu del se or ya ha dejado de luchar con ellos y est n sin cristo y sin dios en el mundo en un tiempo fueron un pueblo deleitable y tuvieron a cristo por pastor suyo s dios el padre los guiaba
2682090 oh bello pueblo c mo pudisteis apartaros de las v as del se or
2682091 he aqu si no hubieseis hecho esto no habr ais ca do
2682092 oh bellos hijos e hijas vosotros padres y madres vosotros esposos y esposas pueblo bello c mo pudisteis haber ca do
2682093 pero he aqu hab is desaparecido y mi dolor no puede haceros volver
2682094 por el poder del padre con lo cual ha logrado la victoria sobre la tumba y en l tambi n es consumido el aguij n de la muerte
2682095 y l lleva a efecto la resurrecci n de los muertos y la redenci n del mundo
2682096 arrepent os y sed bautizados en el nombre de jes s y as os al evangelio de cristo que no s lo en estos anales os ser presentado sino tambi n en los anales que llegar n de los jud os a los gentiles anales que vendr n de los gentiles a vosotros
2682097 porque he aqu se escriben stos el libro de morm n con el fin de que cre is en aqu llos la biblia y si cre is en aqu llos la biblia tambi n creer is en stos el libro de morm n
2682098 y sois bautizados primero en el agua y despu s con fuego y con el esp ritu santo siguiendo el ejemplo de nuestro salvador entonces os ir bien en el d a del juicio
2682099 yo quedo solo para escribir el triste relato de la destrucci n de mi pueblo
2682100 mas he aqu han desaparecido y yo cumplo el mandamiento de mi padre y no s si me matar n o no por tanto escribir y esconder los anales en la tierra y no importa a d nde yo vaya
2682101 al verdadero dios salvo los disc pulos de jes s los tres nefitas trasladados quienes permanecieron en la tierra hasta que la iniquidad de la gente fue tan grande que el se or no les permiti permanecer con el pueblo y nadie sabe si est n o no sobre la faz de la tierra
2682102 mas he aqu mi padre y yo los hemos visto y ellos nos han ministrado
2682103 oh vosotros corruptos vosotros hip critas vosotros maestros que os vend is por lo que se corrompe
2682104 por qu os adorn is con lo que no tiene vida y sin embargo permit s que el hambriento y el necesitado y el desnudo y el enfermo y el afligido pasen a vuestro lado sin hacerles caso
2682105 s por qu form is vuestras abominaciones secretas para obtener lucro y dais lugar a que las viudas y tambi n los hu rfanos lloren ante el se or y tambi n que la sangre de sus padres y sus maridos clame al se or desde el suelo venganza sobre vuestra cabeza
2682106 he aqu la espada de la venganza se cierne sobre vosotros y pronto viene el d a en que l vengar la sangre de los santos en vosotros porque no soportar m s sus clamores
2682107 volveos pues oh incr dulos volveos al se or clamad fervientemente al padre en el nombre de jes s para que quiz se os halle sin mancha puros hermosos y blancos en aquel grande y postrer d a habiendo sido purificados por la sangre del cordero
2682108 y tambi n os hablo a vosotros que neg is las revelaciones de dios y dec s que ya han cesado que no hay revelaciones ni profec as ni dones ni vanidades ni hablar en lenguas ni la interpretaci n de lenguas
2682109 he aqu os digo que aquel que niega estas cosas no conoce el evangelio de cristo s no ha le do las escrituras y si las ha le do no las comprende
2682110 he aqu dios creo a ad n y por ad n vino la ca da del hombre
2682111 y a causa de la redenci n del hombre que vino por jesucristo son llevados de vuelta a la presencia del se or s en esto son redimidos todos los hombres porque la muerte de cristo hace efectiva la resurrecci n la cual lleva a cabo una redenci n de un sue o eterno del cual todos los hombres despertar n por el poder de dios cuando suene la trompeta y saldr n peque os as como grandes y todos comparecer n ante su tribunal redimidos y libres de esta ligadura eterna de la muerte la cual es una muerte temporal
2682112 y entonces viene el juicio del santo sobre ellos y entonces viene el momento en que el que es impuro continuar siendo impuro y el que es justo continuar siendo justo el que es feliz permanecer feliz y el que es infeliz ser infeliz todav a
2682113 he aqu os digo que qui n crea en cristo sin dudar nada cuanto pida al padre en el nombre de cristo le ser concedido y esta promesa es para todos aun hasta los extremos de la tierra
2682114 y ahora bien he aqu qui n puede resistir las obras del se or
2682115 oh no despreci is pues ni os asombr is antes bien escuchad las palabras del se or y pedid al padre en el nombre de jes s cualquier cosa que necesit is
2682116 cuidaos de ser bautizados indignamente cuidaos de tomar el sacramento de cristo indignamente antes bien mirad que hag is todas las cosas dignamente y haced lo en el nombre de jesucristo el hijo del dios viviente y si hac is esto y persever is hasta el fin de ninguna manera ser is desechados
2682117 y el se or jesucristo les conceda que sean contestadas sus oraciones seg n su fe y dios el padre se acuerde del convenio que ha hecho con la casa de israel y los bendiga para siempre mediante la fe en el nombre de jesucristo am n
2682118 clamaba desde la ma ana hasta la puesta del sol exhortando a los del pueblo a creer en dios para arrepentimiento no fuese que quedaran destruidos dici ndoles que por medio de la fe todas las cosas se cumplen
2682119 de modo que los que creen en dios pueden tener la firme esperanza de un mundo mejor s aun un lugar a la diestra de dios y esta esperanza viene por la fe proporciona un ancla a las almas de los hombres y los hace seguros y firmes abundando siempre en buenas obras siendo impulsados a glorificar a dios
2682120 que la fe es las cosas que se esperan y no se ven por tanto no contend is porque no veis
2682121 porque no recib s ning n testimonio sino hasta despu s de la prueba de vuestra fe
2682122 para que tengan esperanza en las cosas que no han visto
2682123 no pudo ocultarle su dedo de su vista por consiguiente le mostr todas las cosas porque ya no se le pod a mantener fuera del ver
2682124 los insensatos hacen burla mas se lamentar n y mi gracia es suficiente para los mansos para que no saquen provecho de vuestra debilidad
2682125 he aqu mostrar a los gentiles su debilidad y les mostrar que la fe la esperanza y la caridad conducen a m la fuente de toda rectitud
2682126 y yo moroni habiendo o do estas cosas me consol y dije oh se or h gase tu justa voluntad
2682127 porque el hermano de jared dijo al monte de zer n ap rtate
2682128 pues as te manifestaste a tus disc pulos porque despu s que tuvieron fe y hablaron en tu nombre te mostraste a ellos con gran poder
2682129 y tambi n me acuerdo de que has dicho que tienes preparada una morada para el hombre s entre las mansiones de tu padre en lo cual el hombre puede tener una esperanza m s excelente por tanto el hombre debe tener esperanza o no puede recibir una herencia en el lugar que t has preparado
2682130 y adem s recuerdo que t has dicho que has amado al mundo aun al grado de dar tu vida por el mundo a fin de volverla a tomar con objeto de preparar un lugar para los hijos de los hombres
2682131 y ahora s que este amor que has tenido por los hijos de los hombres es la caridad por tanto a menos que los hombres tengan caridad no pueden heredar ese lugar que has preparado en las mansiones de tu padre
2682132 y ahora yo moroni me despido de los gentiles s y tambi n de mis hermanos a quienes amo hasta que nos encontremos ante el tribunal de cristo donde todos los hombres sabr n que mis vestidos no se han manchado con vuestra sangre
2682133 y entonces sabr is que he visto a jes s que l ha hablado conmigo cara a cara y que me dijo con sencilla humildad en mi propio idioma as como un hombre lo dice a otro concerniente a estas cosas
2682134 y ahora quisiera exhortaros a buscar a este jes s de quien han escrito los profetas y ap stoles a fin de que la gracia de dios el padre y tambi n del se or jesucristo y del esp ritu santo que da testimonio de ellos est y permanezca en vosotros para siempre jam s am n
2682135 ando errante por donde puedo para proteger mi propia vida
2682136 que son de la iglesia y que son los pac ficos disc pulos de cristo
2682137 conducta pac fica para con los hijos de los hombres
2682138 todo lo que es bueno viene de dios y lo que es malo viene del diablo
2682139 a todo hombre se da el esp ritu de cristo para que sepa discernir el bien del mal porque toda cosa que invita a hacer lo bueno y persuade a creer en cristo es enviada por el poder y el don de cristo por lo que sabr is con un conocimiento perfecto que es de dios
2682140 sabiendo dios todas las cosas dado que existe de eternidad en eternidad he aqu l envi ngeles para ministrar a los hijos de los hombres para manifestar concerniente a la venida de cristo y que de cristo habr a de venir todo lo bueno y todas las cosas que son buenas vienen de cristo
2682141 empezaron los hombres a ejercitar la fe en cristo y as por medio de la fe se aferraron a todo lo bueno y as fue hasta la venida de cristo
2682142 los hombres son salvos por la fe en su nombre y por la fe llegan a ser hijos de dios
2682143 si ten is fe en m tendr is poder para hacer cualquier cosa que me sea conveniente arrepent os todos vosotros extremos de la tierra y venid a m y sed bautizados en mi nombre y tened fe en m para que se is salvos
2682144 porque ning n hombre puede ser salvo a menos que tenga fe en su nombre por tanto si los milagros han cesado la fe tambi n ha cesado y terrible es la condici n del hombre pues se halla como si no se hubiera efectuado redenci n alguna
2682145 c mo pod is lograr la fe a menos que como consecuencia teng is esperanza
2682146 vosotros tambi n pod is tener esperanza si tan s lo ten is fe
2682147 esperanza por medio de la expiaci n de cristo y el poder de su resurrecci n en que ser is resucitados a vida eterna y esto por causa de vuestra fe en l de acuerdo con la promesa
2682148 si un hombre tiene fe en cristo y en su expiaci n es necesario que como consecuencia tenga esperanza en la promesa de la resurrecci n porque ambas est n inseparablemente unidas porque sin fe en la expiaci n de cristo no puede haber esperanza en la resurrecci n
2682149 la caridad es sufrida y es benigna y no tiene envidia ni se envanece no busca lo suyo no slide 217 se irrita f cilmente no piensa el mal no se regocija en la iniquidad sino se regocija en la verdad todo lo sufre todo lo cree todo lo espera todo lo soporta
2682150 pero el mayor de ellos es el amor puro de cristo
2682151 se envanece no se irrita f cilmente no piensa el mal
2682152 todo lo sufre todo lo cree todo lo espera todo lo soporta
2682153 pedir al padre con toda la energ a de nuestros corazones que seamos llenos de este amor
2682154 que t has dicho que has amado al mundo aun al grado de dar tu vida por el mundo a fin de volverla a tomar con objeto de preparar un lugar para los hijos de los hombres y ahora s que este amor que has tenido por los hijos de los hombres es la caridad por tanto a menos que los hombres tengan caridad e intenten manifestarla en sus propias vidas pero aun m s importante sean recipientes dispuestos y dignos de ella tal y como se recibe de cristo no pueden heredar ese lugar que has preparado en las mansiones de tu padre
2682155 por consiguiente amados hermanos m os pedid al padre con toda la energ a de vuestros corazones que se is llenos de este amor que l ha otorgado a todos los que son disc pulos verdaderos de su hijo jesucristo para que llegu is a ser hijos de dios para que cuando l aparezca seamos semejantes a l porque lo veremos tal como es para que tengamos esta esperanza para que seamos purificados as como l es puro
2682156 por tanto debe haber fe y si debe haber fe tambi n debe haber esperanza y si debe haber esperanza debe haber caridad tambi n
2682157 y a menos que teng is caridad de ning n modo ser is salvos en el reino de dios ni ser is salvos en el reino de dios si no ten is fe ni tampoco si no ten is esperanza
2682158 y procurad toda buena d diva y no toqu is el don malo ni la cosa impura para que se cumplan los convenios del padre eterno
2682159 y perfeccionaos en l y absteneos de toda impiedad y si os absten is de toda impiedad y am is a dios con toda vuestra alma mente y fuerza entonces su gracia os es suficiente para que por su gracia se is perfectos en cristo
2682160 y adem s si por la gracia de dios sois perfectos en cristo y no neg is su poder entonces sois santificados en cristo por la gracia de dios mediante el derramamiento de la sangre de cristo que est en el convenio del padre para la remisi n de vuestros pecados a fin de que llegu is a ser santos sin mancha
2682161 y ahora me despido de todos pronto ir a descansar en el para so de dios hasta que mi esp ritu y mi cuerpo de nuevo se re nan y sea llevado triunfante por el aire para encontraros ante el agradable tribunal del gran jehov el juez eterno de vivos y muertos am n
2682162 ning n hombre inicuo podr a haber escrito un libro como ste y ning n hombre bueno lo escribir a a menos que fuera verdadero y dios le mandara hacerlo
2682163 vivo y poderoso m s cortante que una espada de dos filos que penetra hasta partir las coyunturas y los tu tanos
2682164 cre a que el libro de morm n era verdadero
2682165 s lo que s he visto lo que he visto y he o do lo que he o do
2682166 vi el ngel y las planchas de las que se tradujo el libro de morm n y o la voz del se or declarar que fue traducido correctamente
2682167 escrib con mi propia mano todo el libro de morm n con excepci n de unas pocas p ginas tal y como proced a de labios del profeta pues l lo tradujo por el don y el poder dios contempl con mis ojos y palp con mis manos las planchas de oro de las que se tradujo ese libro es verdadero
2682168 jos smith el profeta y vidente del se or ha hecho m s por la salvaci n del hombre en este mundo que cualquier otro que ha vivido en l vivi grande y muri grande a los ojos de dios y de su pueblo y como la mayor a de los ungidos del se or ha sellado su misi n y obras con su propia sangre
2682169 los testadores han muerto y su testimonio est en vigor
2682170 y la gracia de dios el padre cuyo trono est en las alturas de los cielos y de nuestro se or jesucristo que se sienta a la diestra de su poder te acompa e y quede contigo para siempre
2682171 las inteligencias que fueron organizadas antes que existiera el mundo
2682172 la luz de verdad que no fue creada ni hecha ni tampoco lo puede ser
2682173 por otra parte tuvimos a nuestros padres terrenales que nos disciplinaban y los vener bamos por qu no obedeceremos mucho mejor al padre de los esp ritus y viviremos
2682174 padre nuestro que est s en los cielos santificado sea tu nombre
2682175 he aqu soy jesucristo soy el padre y el hijo
2682176 el padre de los cielos y de la tierra y de todas las cosas que en ellos hay
2682177 he manifestado tu nombre a los hombres que del mundo me diste tuyos eran y me los diste y han guardado tu palabra ahora han conocido que todas las cosas que me has dado proceden de ti porque las palabras que me diste les he dado y ellos las recibieron y han conocido verdaderamente que sal de ti y han cre do que t me enviaste yo ruego por ellos no ruego por el mundo sino por los que me diste porque tuyos son y todo lo m o es tuyo y lo tuyo m o y he sido glorificado en ellos y ya no estoy en el mundo mas stos est n en el mundo y yo voy a ti padre santo a los que me has dado gu rdalos en tu nombre para que sean uno as como nosotros cuando estaba con ellos en el mundo yo los guardaba en tu nombre a los que me diste yo los guard y ninguno de ellos se perdi sino el hijo de perdici n para que la escritura se cumpliese
2682178 mas no ruego solamente por stos sino tambi n por los que han de creer en m por la palabra de ellos para que todos sean uno como t oh padre en m y slide 236 yo en ti que tambi n ellos sean uno en nosotros para que el mundo crea que t me enviaste la gloria que me diste yo les he dado para que sean uno as como nosotros somos uno yo en ellos y t en m para que sean perfectos en unidad para que el mundo conozca que t me enviaste y que los has amado a ellos como tambi n a m me has amado padre aquellos que me has dado quiero que donde yo estoy tambi n ellos est n conmigo para que vean mi gloria que me has dado porque me has amado desde antes de la fundaci n del mundo
2682179 no tem is peque itos porque sois m os y yo he vencido al mundo y vosotros sois de aquellos que mi padre me ha dado
2682180 escucha y oye la voz de aquel que existe de eternidad en eternidad el gran yo soy s jesucristo la luz y la vida del mundo una luz que brilla en las tinieblas y las tinieblas no la comprenden el mismo que vine a los m os en el meridiano de los tiempos pero los m os no me recibieron mas a cuantos me recibieron les di el poder de llegar a ser mis hijos y en igual manera a cuantos me recibieren les dar poder para llegar a ser mis hijos
2682181 porque de cierto os digo que soy el alfa y la omega el principio y el fin la luz y la vida del mundo una luz que resplandece en las tinieblas y las tinieblas no la comprenden vine a los m os y los m os no me recibieron mas a cuantos me recibieron les di el poder de hacer muchos milagros y de llegar a ser los hijos de dios y a los que creyeron en mi nombre les di poder para obtener la vida eterna
2682182 y ahora os digo qui n declarar su generaci n he aqu os digo que cuando su alma haya sido otorgada en ofrenda por el pecado l ver su posteridad y ahora qu dec s vosotros qui n ser su posteridad he aqu os digo que quien ha o do las palabras de los profetas s todos los santos profetas que han profetizado concerniente a la venida del se or os digo que todos aquellos que han escuchado sus palabras y cre do que el se or redimir a su pueblo y han esperado anhelosamente ese d a para la remisi n de sus pecados os digo que stos son su posteridad o sea son los herederos del reino de dios porque stos son aquellos cuyos pecados l ha tomado sobre s stos son aquellos por quienes ha muerto para redimirlos de sus transgresiones y bien no son ellos su posteridad s y no lo son los profetas todo aquel que ha abierto su boca para profetizar que no ha ca do en trasgresi n quiero decir todos los santos profetas desde el principio del mundo os digo que ellos son su posteridad
2682183 si fueseis hijos de abraham las obras de abraham har ais vosotros hac is las obras de vuestro padre si vuestro padre fuese dios ciertamente me amar ais vosotros sois de vuestro padre el diablo y los deseos de vuestro padre quer is hacer
2682184 el campo es el mundo la buena semilla son los hijos del reino y la ciza a son los hijos del malo
2682185 el que practica el pecado es del diablo porque el diablo peca desde el principio para esto apareci el hijo de dios para deshacer las obras del diablo todo aquel que es nacido de dios no practica el pecado porque la simiente de dios permanece en l y no puede pecar porque es nacido de dios en esto se manifiestan los hijos de dios y los hijos del diablo todo aquel que no hace justicia y que no ama a su hermano no es de dios
2682186 de modo que como est escrito son dioses s los hijos de dios
2682187 y ellos son de cristo y cristo es de dios
2682188 y ahora de cierto os digo yo estuve en el principio con el padre y soy el primog nito y todos los que por medio de m son engendrados son part cipes de esa gloria y son la iglesia del primog nito
2682189 porque aunque teng is diez mil ayos en cristo no tendr is muchos padres pues en cristo jes s yo os engendr por medio del evangelio
2682190 porque quienes son fieles hasta obtener estos dos sacerdocios de los cuales he hablado y magnifican su llamamiento son santificados por el esp ritu para la renovaci n de sus cuerpos llegan a ser los hijos de mois s y de aaron y la descendencia de abraham y la iglesia y reino y los elegidos de dios
2682191 gu rdate delante de l y oye su voz no le seas rebelde porque l no perdonar vuestra rebeli n porque mi nombre est en l
2682192 la revelaci n de jesucristo que dios le dio para manifestar a sus siervos las cosas que deben suceder pronto y la declar envi ndola por medio de su ngel a su siervo juan
2682193 yo juan soy el que oy y vio estas cosas y despu s que las hube o do y visto me postr para adorar a los pies del ngel que me mostraba estas cosas pero l me dijo mira no lo hagas porque yo soy consiervo tuyo de tus hermanos los profetas y de los que guardan las palabras de este libro adora a dios
2682194 he aqu yo vengo pronto y mi galard n conmigo para recompensar a cada uno seg n sea su obra yo soy el alfa y la omega el principio y el fin el primero y el ltimo
2682195 l es la imagen del dios invisible el primog nito de toda creaci n porque en l fueron creadas todas las cosas las que hay en los cielos y las que hay en la tierra visibles e invisibles sean tronos sean dominios sean principados sean potestades todo fue creado por medio de l y para l y l es antes de todas las cosas y todas las cosas en l subsisten y l es la cabeza del cuerpo que es la iglesia l que es el principio el primog nito de entre los muertos para que en todo tenga la preeminencia por cuanto agrad al padre que en l habitase toda plenitud
2682196 y otra vez cuando introduce al primog nito en el mundo dice ad renle todos los ngeles de dios
2682197 y sabemos que a los que aman a dios todas las cosas les ayudan a bien esto es a los que conforme a su prop sito son llamados porque a los que antes conoci tambi n los predestin para que fuesen hechos conformes a la imagen de su hijo para que l sea el primog nito entre muchos hermanos
2682198 he aqu el am n el testigo fiel y verdadero el principio de la creaci n de dios
2682199 y ahora de cierto os digo yo estuve en el principio con el padre y soy el primog nito
2682200 vosotros tambi n estuvisteis en el principio con el padre lo que es esp ritu s el esp ritu de verdad
2682201 por lo cual deb a ser en todo semejante a sus hermanos para venir a ser misericordioso y fiel sumo sacerdote en lo que a dios se refiere para expiar los pecados del pueblo

2682230 from now on i have nothing needed to be protected and pursued and the origin of my misery was gone however only through this painful lesson did i finally understand the misery i complained so much in the past is nothing compared with what i am going through now unfortunately i had hurt my husband and son for those trivialities and made them suffer with me
2682231 i want to tell those who are confined by miseries only when you feel miserable will what happened to you become a misery only when you go through this pain will you obtain higher and deeper wisdom if you have never felt miserable you must have gained the immediate awakening the immediate entry into bodhisattva hood

2682241 the illusion that getting another person will make you happy is a very devastating illusion because it wasnt true the first time and theres no reason for it to be true a second time
2682242 i was extremely vulnerable and i was not as in control of my emotions as i thought because the new relationship was so comfortable it really was an escape i realized later that there was so much more healing to do when someone comes along and is attracted to you and youre attracted to that person you have to be aware that this is not the time for that
2682243 many times folks ask is there a particular period of time that i should wait before i get into other relationships time isnt really the major factor rather its knowing yourself and your motivations and knowing who you are and why you want a new relationship
2682244 i have learned to be content whatever the circumstances i know what it is to be in need and i know what it is to have plenty i have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry whether living in plenty or in want i can do everything through him who gives me strength
2682245 probably the best advice i received was that my self esteem is not based on how other people view me if someone rejects me sure the pain is real and it hurts but my true self esteem is based on how god views me god sees me as a lovable wonderful person who is so valuable to him that i was worth dying for that is why his son jesus christ came to earth and died on the cross i can still get up and walk out and hold my head high because if the god of the universe loves me and says i am valuable then his opinion is all that really matters
2682246 you are precious and honored in my sight and i love you do not be afraid for i am with you
2682247 when you go through experiences of loneliness invariably youre going to begin looking inward thinking did i do something to set this up should i have acted differently is there something wrong with me questions like that can crop up and the result of this self doubt can be guilt
2682248 i was feeling broken worthless and disappointed in myself people would say elsa god loves you and i would say whatever i didnt buy it not at all
2682249 moving away from that attitude is a process be assured that god does not despise broken people he knows youre broken he knows youre going to make wrong choices what delights him is when you come to him with your hurts and poor choices because he can do something about them
2682250 when you come to him he thinks im so happy to see you you are an amazing child of mine i have handcrafted you i have given you gifts you havent even begun to explore yet i have a hope and a future for you youll be so glad you came to me this will be a choice you will never regret

2682264 but we saw poverty here in a new way a spiritual poverty all sense of community was missing our minds were blown by that missionary work in kenya is easy you stand on a street with a guitar and a crowd will come people there are very sympathetic to the gospel message here even the basic bible stories are absent people only know jesus as a swear word
2682265 were better missionaries than us in the first stages because they played in the street and did not see dangers we saw they got into homes of other children and so wed meet their parents the more people got to know us the safer we became
2682266 it isnt racial yet but it could easily tip into it
2682267 i hope the party will give me a chance to get the two sides together and perhaps even agree a rota of adults willing to take the children to the local park to play football
2682268 when we moved in we were the only black faces in these 200 homes we really did stick out like a sore thumb but i have never felt any racial prejudice
2682269 he had used drugs so much that his brain was blown and his systems were not working
2682270 my message is one of thank you thank you that you have brought the word of god to us because it is from that heritage that i became a christian but that same message that was so crucial back then is not taken seriously here in britain any more
2682271 we dont say that people here know we work in the community and they appreciate that they know we go to church our work now is about the things that need to be in place before they can start to respond to god
2682272 because we believe they are not ready for a very in your face discussion of belief i liken it to trying to speak on the phone before you dial what is vital in the initial stages is rebuilding of community which is godly in itself
2682273 but i know their response now to the word god will be a shutting of the door
2682274 people here have felt disappointed by the church for a long time
2682275 my feeling is that church and state were too close together in this country so when people felt marginalised and ill treated by government policies it was blamed on the church too
2682276 opportunities are beginning to occur one local lady who saw us working on a community garden and asked why we were doing it became curious about church in childhood she would go but had stopped we invited her back and now she is a strong participant and on the parish council
2682277 dwarfs ugly and repulsive looking to the last degree whose habits were beyond belief for uncleanliness
2682278 human relationships ideally are meant to be pictures of godly love
2682279 when a husband and wife share real solid love its not difficult at that point to know what gods love is like and to feel a sense of richness in the lord
2682280 even though i knew god was with me i couldnt feel him
2682281 i remember there came a time in my life when i realized that god was always going to be there for me and that i might be lonely at times but i was never going to be alone once i realized that i was able to go forward and not worry about being alone any more
2682282 for none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone if we live we live to the lord and if we die we die to the lord so whether we live or die we belong to the lord
2682283 you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart

2682293 i know dad would never cast you if he didnt believe you could do the part really well
2682294 ellie im putting any additional money in very conservative investments so we wont ever have to worry about our finances again
2682295 i know what i told you ellie but we cant pass this up

2682297 i hate my life please help me i am going crazy right now
2682298 we got her away from him before it got worse
2682299 shell live with this for the rest of her life but we got her away from him
2682300 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2682301 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury
2682302 it isnt one of those things where you drop a meter in the water and read a needle
2682303 what are you crazy we have to treat everyone and anyone dude we are medical professionals
2682304 no no it is ok you dont need to pull down your shorts
2682305 when i got this job as a bus operator a little over 10 years ago they told us it was like hitting the lottery and they were not too far off
2682306 im not a regular union flag waver since they usually only seem to defend the workers who have attendance or other abuse problems
2682307 please do not say management is strapped for funds when contract talks begin and state our wages may be frozen and we need to pay more for health care use the money that is wasted every day to offset these expenses
2682308 also im in favor of bringing back operators laid off a while ago but not when were sitting around looking at each other however the authority thinks differently and some are being brought back now doesnt someone see what is going on
2682309 i have a few friends who work for pat and it is an unwritten rule that you call off sick so other drivers can get your shift and the accompanying overtime privatize the thing and be done with it
2682310 management would work us 15 16 hours and the next day they may have kept you around for three or four hours imagine having a job like that think about it also i know someone with a bad back who was off on workers comp for years while he worked as a constable when he came back he was put in charge of a department in a newly created job no politics here right
2682311 let the facts be known that it was managements decision to employ these individuals who do not want to work or abuse the sick leave policy
2682312 do you think for one minute that the union wants to be degraded every time a contract has to be renewed
2682313 we will continue to investigate to see what is happening at the plant to see what they have to do to get a handle on their food safety issues

2682315 are you finding a common theme throughout the settings of your books this summer
2682316 its possible to create a portfolio that covers as much as 500 000 to 600 000
2682317 get a lexus my mom has one and she loves it
2682318 in what seems to be a repeat of what happened in july a few news sites have mentioned that there is evidence of a campaign against georgia
2682319 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
2682320 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2682321 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2682322 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2682323 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2682324 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2682325 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2682326 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2682327 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2682328 i should have known that people would feel that way
2682329 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2682330 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2682331 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2682332 i want to take this opportunity to express profound sympathy to the families
2682333 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2682334 we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2682335 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province brigadier dawson said
2682336 shadow governor responsible for authorising bomb attacks across the province
2682337 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan brigadier dawson said
2682338 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province brigadier dawson said
2682339 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12 people
2682340 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2682341 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2682342 i got my artist tay dizm and ive already got his single beam me up featuring me and rick ross ive also got young cash coming out right now jay lyriq ive got a lot of stuff coming on my nappy boy label

2682345 if you wouldve come to my wedding you would have heard the records at my reception everybody was going crazy its this one record we got thats called talk that its phenomenal everybody is like you rapping like that i been doing that its nothing for me
2682346 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2682347 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone
2682348 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2682349 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2682350 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2682351 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2682352 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2682353 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2682354 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2682355 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital

2682357 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2682358 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2682359 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2682360 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2682361 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2682362 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2682363 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2682364 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away

2682368 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
2682369 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage

2682382 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private

2682408 in the full wet conditions this morning we had plenty of grip but this afternoon as the track dried out a little we started to struggle we are on the second row and at the end of the day thats a good place to be my rizla suzuki team will work hard to give me the best bike possible for tomorrow and im confident it will all come together
2682409 tom had the pace to challenge for the front row but the drying track right at the end of the session confounded his bike set up and didnt give him the chance to achieve that
2682410 second row isnt the end of the world and i know tom has been riding incredibly well lately im confident in either the wet or the dry he can fight for the podium
2682411 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2682412 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2682413 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2682414 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2682415 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2682416 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2682417 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2682418 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2682419 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia

2682430 when you are looking at the improvements we are talking about with the suspension they are difficult to quantify
2682431 if you get the dampers working a bit better you know it is better but how much lap time or how much consistency does that really mean it is difficult to quantify so it will be interesting to see how it all works
2682432 this system has not been fully optimised because we havent done enough rig testing on it in the august break we have got some time on rigs to really scan it properly and tune it properly for valencia
2682433 it is still a fairly heavy compromise in terms of what we have had to achieve within the constraints of the gearbox
2682434 if that suspension philosophy was designed from scratch it would not be as heavy as it has turned out to be as we have had to compromise
2682435 georgian officials said their only way out of the conflict was for the united states to step in but with american military intervention unlikely they were hoping for the west to exert diplomatic pressure to stop the russian attacks
2682436 if the world is not able to stop russia here then russian tanks and russian paratroopers can appear in every european capital

2682477 texas faces a looming crisis while our diverse high tech economy relies on a highly skilled highly educated work force we rank near the bottom in the nation at producing college graduates
2682478 unfortunately texas recent efforts to close the gaps in college participation continue to fall far short of what is necessary unless the state significantly increases investment in direct grant aid more students and families will be priced out of a college education further jeopardizing our social and economic future

2682505 ive seen sex and the city twice already it pushed all the buttons it made me laugh made me cry to be honest i felt quite traumatised by it all
2682506 in a way seeing the four women in sex and the city and how the story of their lives had moved on reminded me of the spice girls and how weve moved on
2682507 the spice girls reunion tour was a very healing experience for me it put to bed every bit of doubt guilt insecurity i had about leaving the girls when i did i felt id made amends with them
2682508 i especially got into their promotion of teaching women about safe sex and about not being afraid to carry condoms
2682509 one of the things i tell them is most men are just going to be really happy to be there in the first place so dont be afraid to insist on safe sex every time
2682510 we still dont know whats wrong but yes it is a cancer scare
2682511 jade has undergone a series of tests but the doctors cant pinpoint the problem shes still in pain and its a worry
2682512 jade and jack are no longer an item but remain very close friends hes helping her out with the kids and has been great

2682515 darwin was fascinated by questions of hair colour and the role it might play in choosing sexual partners he was keen to test whether english blondes really were more likely to stay single with a resulting decrease in blonde hair in subsequent generations
2682516 there are nine sets of calculations in which darwin and his son george who was about to take up a fellowship at cambridge combined and reanalysed the data
2682517 sadly so far none of darwins letters to beddoe have been found there are no fewer than nine sets of calculations in which darwin and his son george who was just about to take up a fellowship in cambridge combined and reanalysed the data
2682518 eventually darwin came to the conclusion that the experimental basis was not good enough both beddoe and darwin came to the conclusion that the original results were misleading and didnt make sufficient allowance for the darkening of hair with age
2682519 i hated those pictures of me when i was 15 so much
2682520 i had to have my hair short for school and i felt like a boy
2682521 my father was a gardener and worked in the royal nursery so having my picture taken with the flowers being grown especially for the queens bouquet was an incredible opportunity and an honour i just loathed my hair in the pictures so much i didnt want to show anybody
2682522 thats why from then on i vowed to grow it
2682523 when i got married at 20 years old it was passed my shoulders and by 30 it was hitting the floor
2682524 with five children it was a pain and i remember grabbing my pony tail in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other and going to chop it all off once but i saw how long it was and couldnt bring myself to do it
2682525 since then ive worn it in a tight bun so not many people knew quite how long it was and i only take it down twice a year to give it a wash with baby shampoo its the best product for stopping it getting tangled which is great as it takes between two and three hours to comb as it is
2682526 i have to do it with my fingers as brushes just get caught up in it and then i lay it out across the garden on a sunny day and wait for it to dry
2682527 people think washing it every six months means its dirty but its in great condition as your hair is designed to clean itself with natural oils these people who wash theirs everyday are destroying it
2682528 its thinned over the years and i had made myself a secret pledge that i would have it all cut off for my 70th
2682529 but now my 70th is here im just not sure ill be able to go through with it my grandchildren would never forgive me after all its my party piece
2682530 we get lots of online qualifiers who have never played in a live deep stack tournament such as the gukpt so these trials will give them plenty of opportunity to prepare for the live events they have qualified for

2682533 wed been talking about making a concept album for ages
2682534 when we started metal more than 30 years ago bands were doing epic pieces all over the place we had an idea to do something but we decided to put it on hold
2682535 there was instant understanding and recognition here was an incredible man who attained fame but also suffered for his beliefs his writings which some claim predicted world war ii and the world trade center attack were quite musical it was time to give him the judas priest treatment
2682536 we grabbed it by the reins before it could go careening around central park
2682537 its our blessing really that after so many years writing and recording we understand the magnitude of these things usually our albums have songs about one topic then another and another this one had to be cohesive it had to follow nostradamus story
2682538 surprisingly when glenn tipton k k downing and myself got to it the music just flowed out of us there was a great feeling of excitement and energy we were creating something very special when it was over we had more than we needed if you can believe it and the cds are over two hours
2682539 this is a broad metal opera and it has its rightful place in the classical landscape sometime next year we hope to do the whole thing live either at the carnegie hall
2682540 we feel musically in touch with our wonderful heavy metal community
2682541 we had set up a mastering date we were already paying for so we were mixing at her producers place while the guy was mastering the ones we had already finished it was that down to the wire
2682542 its been a long time and i have less daily interaction with lots of kids
2682543 i have much more daily interaction with one kid its funny i worked with so many more adults and so many fewer kids i actually found that somewhat stressful
2682544 when im working with the kids its like oh you like this great this one will be fun you can feel it working i felt like i was depending on myself and the reactions of adults im glad adults like the cd but if kids dont like it no adult is going to buy it
2682545 he would play a song for me and i would say you know when i hear that one it makes my stomach feel bad so play it again he opened up all the possibilities and if i didnt like them they were gone
2682546 i had my first open mic in august the next month after that i met my manager the next month after that my label was at the gig

2682656 a lot of times when they say cautions its because it is an irritant if you keep it on your skin long so when you do handle it like any product because it is a manure product or its a fertilizer product so you dont want to leave it on your hands its concentrated

2682672 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2682673 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2682674 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2682675 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2682676 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2682677 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for

2682683 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2682684 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2682685 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2682686 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others

2682688 is our modern farming and food processing technology combined with higher levels of pollution greatly influencing the spread of cancer
2682689 if you get college presidents off the record and ask them how in the real world they inhabit 21 seems to be working i think you might get a somewhat different view
2682690 its somewhat like trying to run a city where there are two different laws in force and you dont know what set of laws governs what set of citizens
2682691 lets suppose we had traffic regulations that said if you are under 21 you can only drive 55 miles per hour but if you are over 21 you can drive 70 how do you enforce that you know how impossible that would be
2682692 i said in my oped that 21 is bad social policy and bad law and i believe that
2682693 but i had no idea that it would resonate with as many people as it did this is not a cause that i sought out it sort of found me
2682694 but now my aim and the aim of choose responsibility is to engage the public in a debate about how 21 is working
2682695 we think the chief impediment to lowering the drinking age is in the current law that says that any state that sets its drinking age lower than 21 forfeits 10 percent of its federal highway funds
2682696 but we think there are many legitimate issues that should be discussed including the states rights issue
2682697 we want to have the debate and we want to let the states decide for themselves if they want two sets of laws based on age
2682698 and we think that when you survey the landscape and see how the restrictions put into place in 1984 have played out 18 just makes more sense than 21
2682699 its interesting we embrace and allow local options when that local option exercises a more restrictive version of the law

2682728 over a period of time when we will have built hundreds of towers it may become tiresome to find names for all of these so we have decided to uniformly call our projects mag followed by a number for the first project mag 214 the number was arrived at because our chairman has two wives and 14 children

2682731 it is not difficult to understand the reason for this trend investing in property in the uae is seen as safe and rewarding and currently better than investing in bonds or stocks in spite of numerous challenges such as rising costs and shortage of contractors the real estate sector in the uae is still one of the most important investment areas in the country the return on investment can reach as high as 40 per cent an unbeatable figure
2682732 foreign individuals and corporates currently represent between 60 to 70 per cent of buyers of freehold units some developers are now re purchasing properties they have developed from current owners to re invest them in the market with returns ranging between 20 and 30 per cent around two to five per cent of developed properties are re purchased by developers

2682779 the obvious beneficiaries of weaker oil and a firmer us dollar are global stock markets as the us has been the rocky horror show in terms of concerns it is now one of the more obvious candidates for a relief short covering rally
2682780 policy responses to the credit crunch have helped to successfully get out of a financial squeeze you need three things 1 a cheap currency 2 a positive yield curve and 3 the recapitalization of bank balance sheets with surprising speed all three of these conditions are now being met in the us
2682781 bull markets are born on pessimism grow on skepticism mature on optimism and die on euphoria
2682782 eurozone gdp almost certainly contracted in q2 eurostat will release its flash estimate on august 14 the same day that germany and france release their own first estimates if the numbers surprise on the downside the markets will start anticipating a rate cut by the ecb on september 4
2682783 europe has moved further along the road towards a recession than the us the economic data of the past two weeks make that conclusion hard to avoid
2682784 is this simply a bounce from the extreme levels that we highlighted three weeks ago or is the investment environment starting to improve we argue the following
2682785 so the investment environment is not that dire in fact away from the massive volatility prevalent in the financials and commodity space which together seem to account for almost 50 or more of most indices and volumes traded other sectors technology healthcare staples are holding their own at this juncture we reiterate our belief that it makes more sense to focus on these forgotten parts of the market and resist the urges to call tops or bottoms in the overcrowded financial and commodity spaces
2682786 the world economy is precariously close to a recession in 2009 ubs said as it cut next years global growth forecast due to a us slowdown
2682787 global gross domestic product will expand 2 9 next year from an earlier prediction of 3 1 ubs chief economist larry hatheway wrote in a report published yesterday ubs considers a 2 5 global growth rate as one that is consistent with a recession
2682788 a global recession would be the first since 2001 2002 and may ease inflation thats already projected by the international monetary fund to be the fastest in nine years
2682789 softer global economic activity for longer suggests peaking and then declining inflation hatheway said a sustainable recovery of risk assets probably requires policy recognition that the primary macroeconomic challenge remains weak growth not temporarily high inflation
2682790 the fed will cut interest rates by a further half percentage point this year from the current 2 rate ubs predicts the ecb and the bank of england will probably lower borrowing costs next year hatheway said
2682791 the july ism manufacturing survey showed further softening in already weak domestic demand while a slowing in overseas growth presents a new headwind
2682792 global leading economic indicators have rolled over implying that slower overseas growth will diminish one of the key sources of support for us manufacturers
2682793 the only silver lining is that energy prices have finally begun to recede although oil prices will have to move substantially lower before having a significant economic impact energy price relief will help to ease pressure on profit margins and lower inflation expectations
2682794 the fed left the federal funds rate unchanged at 2 0 no surprises here president fisher dissented he would have preferred a higher federal funds rate the committee included one new member governor elizabeth duke who voted in favor of holding the federal funds rate unchanged
2682795 the fed retained most of the june 25 statement but rearranged the order of sentences and made subtle but important changes
2682796 the mortgage bankers associations mortgage purchase index rose to 315
2682797 sales reports of existing and new home for june contained faint signs of a housing market mending but additional support from a pickup in hiring and willingness of banks to lend money will be necessary for stability in the housing market
2682798 given the weakness in labor market conditions and the absence of the one off tax rebate check consumer spending will most likely decline in the third quarter
2682799 personal income increased 0 1 in june after a 1 8 gain in may the difference in growth of personal income reflects the impact of the economic stimulus act of 2008 excluding the impact of tax rebates personal income increased 0 3 in june following a 0 4 jump in may
2682800 i came away from the freddie mac conference call feeling a little shall we say nicely confused
2682801 the ceo richard syron warned of the troubled times in housing even revised his forecast for home price drops peak to trough from 15 to 18 20 he said were only halfway through the correction
2682802 but then one of his underlings went on to assure everyone that freddie would be able to withstand 40 billion worth of credit pain through 2009 if it finishes raising that 5
2682803 freddie in the second quarter wrote down the value of its subprime and alt a portfolio by 1 billion
2682804 i think armando falcon a former head of ofheo said it best when i interviewed him yesterday
2682805 theyve only written them down by lets say five or 6 total over the past few quarters
2682806 some of the most strongly worded emails from analysts questioning their own ratings came from s amp p according to a draft version of the 38 page report which includes the firms and was reviewed by the wall street journal the unit of mcgraw hill is the largest bond rating firm by revenue
2682807 in one email an s amp p analytical staffer emailed another that a mortgage or structured finance deal was ridiculous and that we should not be rating it the other s amp p staffer replied that we rate every deal adding that it could be structured by cows and we would rate it
2682808 meanwhile an analytical manager in the collateralized debt obligations group at s amp p told a senior analytical manager in a separate email that rating agencies continue to create an even bigger monster the cdo market
2682809 morgan stanley the second biggest us securities firm told several thousand clients this week that they wont be allowed to withdraw money on their home equity credit lines said a person familiar with the situation
2682810 the action mostly affected clients with properties that have lost value according to the person who declined to be identified because the information isnt public the new york based investment bank will review home equity lines of credit or helocs monthly from now on the person said
2682811 wall street firms including morgan stanley are ratcheting back on risks after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and ensuing credit contraction saddled banks and brokerages with almost 500 billion of writedowns and losses
2682812 consistent with the terms of the heloc or home equity line of credit morgan stanley periodically reassesses client property values and risk profiles said christine pollak a morgan stanley spokeswoman in new york
2682813 the first wave of americans to default on their home mortgages appears to be cresting but a second far larger one is quickly building
2682814 homeowners with good credit are falling behind on their payments in growing numbers even as the problems with mortgages made to people with weak or subprime credit are showing their first tentative signs of leveling off after two years of spiraling defaults
2682815 the percentage of mortgages in arrears in the category of loans one rung above subprime so called alternative a mortgages quadrupled to 12 in april from a year earlier delinquencies among prime loans which account for most of the 12 trillion market doubled to 2 7 in that time
2682816 while it is difficult to draw precise parallels among various segments of the mortgage market the arc of the crisis in subprime loans suggests that the problems in the broader market may not peak for another year or two analysts said
2682817 the obviously beneficiaries of weaker oil and a firmer usd are global stock markets
2682818 i think it is now getting a second wind and will recover further provided that banks hold above their initial support levels established by the higher reaction low on 28th and 29th july
2682819 elsewhere wall street shows the steady performance of transports where you can see higher reaction lows since january and the nasdaq which never broke beneath its january march lows
2682820 a steady to rising wall street would represent a tailwind for other stock markets remember the influential leash effect
2682821 asian stock markets should get some traction from a positive wall street leash effect and lower oil prices however the china leash has yet to turn favourable india has shown the best form recently resources markets are currently among the most subdued as brazil and canada were among the last to peak but they have some of the best long term fundamentals despite the correction underway in commodities australia is one of the more oversold markets currently and having seen a downside failure this week should now at least take out the july rally high
2682822 so far weve seen only two 90 downside days since the march high there should be more how many more nobody knows
2682823 given weak technicals the durability of the bear market rally is now in question
2682824 investors often ask how we can tell the difference between a bull market and a rally in a bear market charting experts will argue many points from choppiness in price action to limited participation in the rally by various sectors of the market
2682825 i argue that it is all of the above this confirms that the current rally is of the bear market variety and while it can move higher in its current condition its days are starting to become numbered
2682826 the phrase fits and starts is a good one to apply to todays market
2682827 followers of elliott wave analysis are familiar with the term impulse wave which is just a strong price move in the direction of the major trend
2682828 in contrast corrections are marked by lower activity and technical indicators that do not confirm the action
2682829 heres the really big problem for all investors and traders in todays markets unless one was operating in 1931 he or she has never experienced what is occurring now
2682830 as we have noted in past missives since wwii the fed instigated recessions when it feared inflation mostly wages or excess inventories
2682831 however the current situation recession and the worst financial conditions since the great depression have occurred while the fed was not only pumping record amounts of credit but was also creating a record number of credit facilities taf tslf pbdc
2682832 fiscally tax cuts have already been enacted and the deficit is at a record level before recession has intensified and there has been an inordinate amount of socialization and de facto nationalization
2682833 thats why we asked a couple weeks ago how do we get out of this mess and get the economy growing given all the fixes maneuvers and gambits enacted to prevent recession and debt contraction
2682834 the record amount of fixes have rendered the concepts of freely traded markets moral hazard and market capitalism as fantasies solons are fighting for the life of the political and financial systems
2682835 a very astute executive recently informed us that equity prices are extremely important in pricing and garnering credit you can be sure than solons are keenly aware of this and are acting accordingly
2682836 ergo stocks are likely to continue their manic depressive volatility until an event induces a critical mass of investors and traders to act in a concerted manner
2682837 the last thing that the fed should want is for stocks to surge
2682838 ergo stock market returns are likely to be below trend in the coming quarters if not years
2682839 several money managers are calling for the fed to cut rates now that commodities have declined
2682840 the question for stocks becomes how long will this relief rally on the latest crisis and fix last the post bear stearns crisis relief rally on record fed credit creation and vehicles lasted two months the ensuing decline on the recessing economy and further bank and gse woes lasted two months will this rally last one or two months stay tuned
2682841 the dow surged 331 points moves like that typically take place in bear markets
2682842 some items to be noted according to this weeks barrons earnings on the dow are now a negative 81 34 the dow is running at a net loss this means that the price earnings ratio for the dow is infinity nothing times nothing nothing
2682843 im not saying that were in for a repeat of the 1932 37 bull market im just saying that occasionally great buying areas occur during times of seemingly disastrous statistics
2682844 heres a chart that every home owner and wall streeters should like and its a chart that i havent seen anywhere else what you see here is iyr the exchange traded fund for real estate shares relative to the s amp p 500 composite
2682845 first note that relative strength for iyr turned up in january then a dip with a higher low and most recently a rally toward the april high if the current rise in relative strength breaks out above the upper horizontal line the market will be saying something good about real estate and housing its getting interesting here even while most analysts continue to moan and groan about real estate and housing
2682846 the slick from the sudden fall in oil prices is spreading cheaper oil is good for the economy but investors face a risk of accidents as traders retreat from the expectation that the oil price would continue rising
2682847 yet energy stocks have still fallen more than the underlying oil price
2682848 with energy stocks one of the most popular vehicles for hedge funds playing the oil boom they have sold off disproportionately
2682849 another casualty the big oil exporting emerging markets that were viewed as a geared play on the commodity boom
2682850 there is one asset class that conspicuously has not yet joined the list of casualties oil exporters currencies
2682851 brazils real has appreciated 4 2 against the dollar since energy stocks peaked in may and by an astonishing 35 6 since oil was last at 50 a barrel the rouble has also gained slightly since may and is up 12 8 against the dollar since january last year how long can this last
2682852 i am looking for a lengthy medium term correction in most commodities this can be anything from a few months to a couple of years and occasionally more
2682853 i think the reactions will often be biggest in tracker fund favourites since many people have piled into these in recent years in comparison it may have little effect on commodities such as iron ore and phosphate where there are no futures
2682854 targets are also guesswork as you know and marginal cost of production is inevitably a ballpark figure that will vary considerably from one region to another the markets will show us in their own due time meanwhile we can monitor the trends
2682855 an important article from bloomberg reporter xiao yu unveils some of the chinese strategic thinking behind the latest fall in copper and other metal prices
2682856 what we are seeing is a four way squeeze on copper lower global demand an interruption in chinas power demand the absorbing of china stockpiles while the price is high and selling by the hedge funds who are being mauled by this process
2682857 my view is that by using their stockpiles at a time of lower demand the chinese appear to be using a fortuitous set of events to put the squeeze on the hedge funds last night copper fell again in a trading pattern that indicated hedge fund selling what xiao is telling us is that the second half of the year china will be back in the market by which time they will be hoping that the current squeeze will have lead to lower prices
2682858 europe has moved further along the road towards a recession than the us the economic data of the past two weeks make that conclusion hard to avoid and jean claude trichet made no great attempt to deny it in his press conference on thursday
2682859 the governor of the european central bank admitted that the data point to a weakening of real gdp growth in mid 2008 and said directly that the bank no longer has a bias towards raising rates
2682860 this was ample reason to sell the euro which already looked as though it had peaked after briefly topping 1 60 by the end of european trading the euro was down 4 4 from its peak against the dollar back to levels it first set in march
2682861 business activity surveys suggest a european contraction in the third quarter similar surveys in the us suggest that the american economy while extremely unhealthy has not dipped into technical recession
2682862 unlike the eurozone the us has an election this year and so it has resorted to moves such as the stimulus tax rebates this may be why it kept gdp growth positive in the second quarter
2682863 ironically thursdays us data suggest the worst of the economic hit from housing may be over but the second round effects of the housing and credit busts on the economy are now being felt
2682864 when germany announced in may that its gdp had grown an annualized 6 in the first quarter we were sceptical
2682865 while germanys official 2q gdp data will not be released until august 14th our fears seem to have been well grounded indeed a major german newspaper has recently been circulating a leaked
2682866 the first of the eurozones big economies reported preliminary q2 gdp data today and the picture was not a pretty one italys gdp contracted 0 3 q o q in q2 and posted zero growth on the year
2682867 that italys economy is stalling out is no surprise already one of the weaker economies in the 15 nation euro zone data in recent weeks have pointed to a marked deceleration in the zones third largest economy consumer morale has plunged to near 15 year lows and business sentiment is the weakest its been in seven years
2682868 european producer prices rose the most in at least 18 years in june on soaring energy costs sharpening the european central banks dilemma over how to balance faster inflation and slowing economic growth
2682869 the 8 increase from a year ago in factory prices in the 15 nations that use the euro was the biggest since the series began in 1990 and followed a 7
2682870 the ecb lifted the benchmark interest rate to a seven year high last month on concerns that consumer price inflation at twice the 2 limit will become embedded in the economy even as growth slows
2682871 manufacturers throughout the euro zone have been able to pass on higher food and energy costs said philip shaw an economist at investec securities in london
2682872 consumer price inflation accelerated to 4 1 last month the fastest pace in more than 16 years the statistics office reported last week
2682873 the bank of england boe opted to leave the official bank rate unchanged at 5 as expected however monetary easing will resume before yearend
2682874 policymakers have been hesitant to cut interest rates given that headline inflation remains well above the central banks 3 mandated ceiling
2682875 the boes decision to delay monetary relief will only amplify the downturn and inevitably result in the need for more monetary stimulus
2682876 house prices fell by almost 11 in the year to july figures showed on thursday one of the biggest year on year falls recorded in the uk
2682877 the decline which means all house price gains since june 2006 have now been wiped out underscores the speed at which the nations housing market is deteriorating
2682878 the indexs july data are matched by another widely watched index compiled by nationwide but the halifax data mark the first time that homes have posted a single month double digit drop year on year in the history of either index
2682879 nationwides housing index recorded a drop of 10 7 for the three months through december 1990 from the same period in 1989
2682880 this is significant for several reasons said michael hume economist at lehman brothers it tells you how out of balance the housing market must have been to generate this level of decline the credit crunch has made what should have been a long term orderly decline in house prices turn into a sudden rout he said
2682881 inevitably chinas gdp growth is slowing following measures introduced early last year to curb economic overheating and to deflate bubbles in the housing and stock markets additionally most of chinas exporters can only experience a downturn because of weak demand from the west
2682882 i suspect that chinas growth will slow more than most analysts are currently forecasting due more to the factors just mentioned than a post olympics drop in beijings construction projects
2682883 a question for investors are these factors behind the slowdown reasons for concern or part of chinas success story
2682884 we have seen china warnings before and they have been largely wrong that record will not prevent another wave of bearish articles and reports now that chinas gdp really is slowing and they will also partly represent a projection of our own economic problems in oecd countries
2682885 however there is a vital difference between chinas slowdown and what we are experiencing in the west

2682926 we believe open discussions and dialogues on issues of religious conversions are imperative to find solutions

2682928 although mccain suggested in his autobiography that months passed between his divorce and remarriage the divorce was granted april 2 1980 and he wed hensley in a private ceremony five weeks later
2682929 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy

2682938 but the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days
2682939 it was decided there and then he was staying there was never any change in our stance
2682940 we had a meeting and i said billy youre falling to bits you admitted on tv that youre physically beaten and told me you cant even swim with your daughter
2682941 the work has got harder for billy over the years and he has been a bit slower that is not his fault but he is in his 50s and cant do what he could at 33 or 43
2682942 i love billy but cant have a trainer who has admitted umpteen times that he is physically beaten how can i expect him to be okay for the next 12 weeks while im preparing to fight malignaggi
2682943 there is no way billy could have been on top form and continue training me
2682944 how do i know how hard or correctly im punching when he has needles and cannot feel his hands when were on the pads
2682945 he might say youre hitting hard but i would be thinking how do you know you cant feel your hands
2682946 if he thinks anything of me hell have a good look in the mirror and admit im falling to bits im physically done
2682947 i dont want to hear from my trainer who is taking so much medication to ease the pain dont worry rick ill get through this training session
2682948 it is me who needs to get through sessions because im the one taking the punches

2682957 the new airport is no better than an ordinary bus stand
2682958 there is no proper seating arrangements for passengers and visitors
2682959 the new airport is no better than an ordinary bus stand
2682960 there is no proper seating arrangements for passengers and visitors
2682961 there has been deviation from the architecture style and design it does not add to the image of bangalore there are no proper facilities for passengers and visitors
2682962 i have raised the issue based on my personal experience at the airport and also because of complaints i have received from several people
2682963 as a representative of the people i cannot sit quietly
2682964 i am a former urban development minister the design of the airport is different from what was approved
2682965 there are lots of possibilities to improve it can be done the legislators panel will decide that
2682966 a poor cousin to other airports of international standards including the new delhi and hyderabad airports

2682969 personally i think facilities are good however scope for improvement is always there
2682970 it is a new airport some questions regarding facilities do get raised when we tend to compare it with other international airports at the same time we need to understand that facilities are far better than at the old airport
2682971 i have used it twice and i did not have any problems of course there certainly is room for improvement
2682972 we will take up the matter with the central government

2683122 despite good fundamentals we have been unable to insulate ourselves from sector developments indeed the second quarter was clearly weaker than the previous year the latter part of the year also seems difficult and the operational result for the second half of the year might dip into the red
2683123 high fuel prices and a trend towards lower ticket prices have been unsettling developments for airlines the overcapacity in the market has not allowed ticket prices to rise in parallel with costs the coming cost cutting programmes in the sector will be so severe that in countries where airlines collapse there may be demands for flight connections to be maintained for business needs using state funds
2683124 the situation in the sector may remain extremely difficult due to expensive fuel and uncertain development of demand in the second half of the year fuel costs are expected to account for around 28 per cent of finnairs turnover whereas last year the jet fuel bill accounted for a fifth of turnover
2683125 in punctuality we are again among the best of european airlines moreover the amount of baggage delays has also fallen to a third of last summers total

2683128 taylor was going to cancel the concert thinking few people could attend but the mayor of cedar rapids asked her to carry on
2683129 the machinery moved no one is working and the parking lots have reopened people are shopping
2683130 it isnt one of those things where you drop a meter in the water and read a needle
2683131 it means youre so emotionally fucked that youre not even worth it anymore
2683132 oh im nowhere near as bad as you nowhere near it
2683133 just because you dont see it doesnt mean that no one else does
2683134 i cant take this anymore were through done finished i cant take the lying anymore
2683135 over what do you mean over you cant dump me it doesnt work that way
2683136 well i just did i really cant take the lying and cheating anymore i should have done this a long time ago
2683137 have you been talking to your nosy fucking friend about me again
2683138 i dont know what youre talking about ceil has never said anything to me about you she knows better than to talk to me about my boyfriends and leave my friends out of this
2683139 you tell me to leave that bitch out of this that she says nothing to you about me and yet youre constantly running to her telling her that your big bad boyfriend is being a dick again
2683140 you come to my home and accuse me of cheating on you and now youre telling me to calm down oh thats rich
2683141 alright just sit down and we can talk about this
2683142 all i want to know is did you sleep with shauna just tell me put me out of my misery
2683143 i shouldnt miss him but i do i cant help it i loved him
2683144 whatever you tell me this time ill do it i promise i cant do this again
2683145 i think that you should just take a break from the relationship world and get your head back on straight you dont need to ruin any future relationships with baggage from past ones
2683146 it means that you have unsolved issues from past relationships that you carry around with you like luggage
2683147 they weigh you down emotionally and mentally and you cant function fully with them
2683148 you pick the same guys over and over again and it just isnt healthy you got hurt bad that first time with dave
2683149 and ever since then you always seem to choose the same guy the good looking smooth talking flirt who turns out to be a sex crazed manipulator you need to take a step back and reevaluate your priorities
2683150 lucy talking to you sometimes i feel like dr phil
2683151 so have you found out anything else about your mystery girl
2683152 how many times do i have to tell you man shes not my mystery girl
2683153 so what else do you know about her so far i mean aside from the fact that youre destined to be together
2683154 a lot of people do around here theyre pretty local
2683155 do you always have to put a damper on everything i say
2683156 im sorry go on what else do you know about her
2683157 honestly nothing really we went to that concert and hung out a while afterwards and other than a strange affinity for fried plantains and cuban stew i really didnt find out much about her
2683158 you catch the ball without looking its almost like you can sense it coming
2683159 i know where youre going to throw it and i can hear you toss it its not like its incredibly loud in here or theres anything to distract me
2683160 i have no idea whenever i see him i can barely get two words in he always seems to be rushing off somewhere
2683161 well we were talking and i said something about how i was upset that his boys nights were interrupting our plans all the time and he said well then maybe we just shouldnt make anymore plans and then he just hung up end of conversation
2683162 i dont know why i say it all the time
2683163 oh i know who you were talking about i was just questioning the nickname
2683164 well i dont know his last name hes a dude and he is from ireland so voil mr ireland
2683165 so things with him are alright what is that supposed to mean
2683166 you know you really shouldnt let me leave things up to my imagination i can have a very dirty mind
2683167 no i meant alright as in ok good explanation of his new name
2683168 uh i dont know i guess i just havent ran into him or anything its not like were friends or anything
2683169 you two looked pretty chummy to me after the show hell even during the show you two were all over each other and dont think i didnt notice it
2683170 whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa back the accusation trolley up there buddy
2683171 seriously there isnt anything going on with us i dont really even know the guy
2683172 im not saying theres anything wrong with it kay im happy for you
2683173 my guy em what on earth are you talking about
2683174 ok maybe you dont know it yet but you two are so perfect together
2683175 what me and cillian we barely even know each other em
2683176 you just wait and see you two are going to be the next romeo and juliet or or or whats their names in west side story
2683177 em doll romeo and juliet killed themselves and west side story was based on romeo and juliet its not a happy story
2683178 i meant that youre the next great love story youre not going to kill yourself der
2683179 i appreciate the sentiment really i do but i just think its a little early on for you to be saying anything even remotely like that honestly that was only the second time i had ever spoken to him
2683180 well first of all you ran into the crowd holding his hand and also when you found me after four year strong you were still holding his hand and
2683181 thats because i didnt want him to get lost in the crowd
2683182 hes a big boy im sure he could have handled the crowd by himself
2683183 psh youve obviously never been in a crowd like that
2683184 anyway after that when we were all hanging out and dancing i believe it was me dancing alone with pete and dan and you dancing all up on mr ireland
2683185 you left me to dance with them what was i supposed to do stand there and be awkward
2683186 i didnt say it was a bad thing you told me to point out when you were all up on him
2683187 i seem to recall him being all up on you then
2683188 so it wasnt you that he had wrapped up in his jacket when we were standing outside and walking to cuban revolution
2683189 he was really warm and i was freezing you were there you know how cold it was out
2683190 kay just admit that you like this guy its alright i wont tell anyone
2683191 i guess were just going to have to get lucy in on this one
2683192 theres nothing to get her in on theres nothing going on between cillian and i
2683193 well you might want to let him in on that little secret because he seemed mighty pleased with your attention
2683194 oh god you dont think hes into me do you
2683195 no its just that i dont know im terrible at this relationship business
2683196 no youre not you always know just whats going on i think youre just scared because you really do like this guy whether or not youll admit it to yourself
2683197 youve never even met this guy you have no idea whats going on with us
2683198 no thats not what i meant and you know it
2683199 why are you getting so defensive then if there really is nothing going on then you have nothing to be defensive about
2683200 surely its not nothing if theyre cornering you about it
2683201 im fine thanks we were just talking about a guy kay likes
2683202 just cillian hes not even a friend of yours who is this strapping young man who came to your rescue
2683203 well how else am i going to describe you youre a dude that tries to steal my chair and reads the same book that i do
2683204 what i meant is that i dont really know much of anything about you other than a bit about your taste in literature and music
2683205 it doesnt really have to be a date even just hanging out and getting to know more about each other than the fact that we both enjoy this here chair
2683206 i just thought it would be nice to get to know you you seem like a very interesting girl
2683207 boy its getting awful late were going to go turn in
2683208 its already that late boy were up way past our bedtime
2683209 yeah sorry about them so what did you want to do
2683210 oh well theres not much to do in this area at this time of night if you were looking to do something now but if we give ourselves a day or so to plan something out we can do something later on this week
2683211 well how about we just work on our drinks for right now and go out to dinner sometime this weekend how does that sound
2683212 hey i dont want to be an ass or anything but i should probably get going
2683213 no its perfectly alright i actually have to head back too
2683214 next semester well actually be moving out into one of those houses over there
2683215 i bet thatll be nice no more having to check in and out with people whenever you want to leave and come back
2683216 yeah its going to be a lot nicer than living here dont get me wrong now i do like it here but its just that i dont have the freedom i would have if i were living on my own
2683217 well say for instance if i wanted to bring a lovely girl home to continue a conversation i would be able to bring her into my own room as opposed to a room a share with two other guys
2683218 oh well youre going to have to go find yourself a lovely girl to converse with then
2683219 just because you havent seen your mystery girl does not mean that i should have to put up with your depressing bullshit dude
2683220 she is not my mystery girl as you so eloquently put it
2683221 and also just because you know her name it doesnt make her any less of a mystery
2683222 what do you know about this girl other than her name
2683223 well i know that she has excellent taste in reading material
2683224 so you two read the same weirdo books big whoop
2683225 and she likes that same chair that i love at the bees knees
2683226 and you two like the same weirdo chair at the same weirdo coffee shop
2683227 dude im sorry to say this but that really doesnt mean anything
2683228 you dont seem to see that our similar interests could lead to a friendship that could lead to a more serious relationship that could lead to us living happily ever after
2683229 guy you have to get over this happily ever after plan of yours
2683230 do you mean to tell me that you dont believe in love
2683231 for the fiftieth time in the last week yes i do believe in love but love isnt something that just happens to you after meeting someone once love is something that grows out of a real relationship
2683232 just you wait ill find her again and youll see
2683233 yeah were going to head down to providence theres a show down there i want to check out
2683234 yes you can drink to your hearts content as long as you dont puke in my car
2683235 alright were going to be leaving in like two hours i want to go to the bees knees first and get some tasty drinkages
2683236 sounds like a plan ill see you in a bit
2683237 no we should just get our drinks and head out i want to get there early enough so that i dont have to battle to the front
2683238 why do you always go up front its so dangerous especially when you go up by yourself
2683239 you know perfectly well that i can handle myself and besides im not alone
2683240 well in that case im going to stay for a bit longer if you dont mind
2683241 you kind of spaced out on us for a second there
2683242 so what i was saying is that were going to this concert tonight
2683243 yeah four year strong is opening for the starting line i think
2683244 yeah theyre one of the first bands i saw when i came over here im quite fond of them
2683245 yeah my roommate let me tag along with him when i first got here because i didnt know anyone we went to a lot of concerts and it was always a lot of fun
2683246 well were going to this show tonight do you want to come with
2683247 its totally cool if you dont want me to tag along i am after all practically a stranger to you
2683248 thanks i wanted an original one but i couldnt find one in good enough shape that was under eighty thousand bucks and the mileage forget it the old ones i looked into werent in spectacular shape and had insane mileage
2683249 understandable if youre looking into a car thats almost forty years old youre going to be looking at something thats been rolled over at least once
2683250 ceil wouldnt buy a car thats been in an accident much less a car thats been rolled over
2683251 em rolled over means that the odometer has completely rolled over
2683252 it means that the car has at least a hundred thousand miles on it once most of the old odometers hit a hundred thousand they start over again because they dont have enough numbers
2683253 oh ok then because i was thinking that there was no way in hell you would buy a car that was that wrecked that it had looked like it had rolled over
2683254 great then you can go up front with ceil and keep her from dying
2683255 she scares me when she goes up there alone im scared that one of these days shes going to get killed
2683256 you have my word i will do my best to watch over her
2683257 how about i just go up and keep you company
2683258 any reason youre not wearing a jacket in the middle of november
2683259 and yes i dont have a jacket because i dont want to deal with the coat check when i get in there i like to just head straight up front
2683260 thats a good idea in theory but it sucks when youre out here in the cold
2683261 i tell her that every time and every time she just says that its a waste of time
2683262 four year strong is going on first then the receiving end of sirens and after them the starting line is headlining i really only want to be up front for four year strong if you want we can stay up for the whole thing
2683263 no im perfectly fine leaving the front after them if you want
2683264 hey my friend is probably going to be coming back here in a few minutes
2683265 we can have ourselves a little bit of a party
2683266 alright lets head back and see if we cant find em
2683267 how are you going to look it up on your phone
2683268 it has the internet on it and everything so i can just google cuban revolution and see whats up
2683269 maybe this whole no jacket thing really is a bad idea
2683270 yeah huge did you see that other place we were standing in front of this has to be at least twice the size
2683271 it may have been shabby but it was awesome it was kind of like the bees knees it had its own little charm
2683272 oh definitely i wasnt saying it was shabby in a bad way but it was just this little hole in the wall place and now its a legit restaurant
2683273 and they still have the same menus i love these menus theyre so different looking
2683274 this place looks like it should be in hollywood or something
2683275 im sorry but any guy that repeatedly ditches you to play poker with stupid friends is an asshole
2683276 i dont want to be the controlling girlfriend who doesnt let him have boys nights
2683277 but when he makes plans with you to go out for your six month anniversary over a month ago and doesnt show up thats him being an asshole
2683278 he didnt call you at all he didnt even explain himself until you fucking called him two hours after you were supposed to leave
2683279 he knows that youll always take him back no matter how much he fucks up so its not a problem if he keeps doing it
2683280 you sit there all high and mighty and think you can see whats going on but you cant you dont have a boyfriend so you dont know how it is youve never had a real long term boyfriend so you dont know how it is to go back to being single
2683281 em doll i love you and all but youre treading in dangerous waters when you pull that shit with me
2683282 just because i dont have a boyfriend doesnt mean that i cant see whats going on dillon is treating you like shit because you let him
2683283 yes i am right just because he buys you flowers sometimes when he fucks up doesnt mean that hes a good guy it just means that he knows how to manipulate you and get you to forgive him
2683284 yeah that might be so but whos the one crying over an asshole
2683285 so no more talk of dillon hes an asshole and thats that
2683286 im ceil but most of my friends call me kay
2683287 its nice to meet someone else with a weird irish name that requires a nickname
2683288 all of my friends have normal names like nicole and molly
2683289 can you not find your house is that it they do all kind of look the same
2683290 yeah i know they must have used the same blueprints for each house
2683291 i know its on this street im just not sure which one it is we jus moved in yesterday and i cant remember what color it is
2683292 well if youre the family that just moved in you live in number 25
2683293 dont mention it and hey if youre ever bored just give me a call or come on over and we can hang out
2683294 oh i will definitely be taking you up on that one
2683295 so i was over ryans house the other day and were sitting with his friends and he keeps talking about our sex lives with his friends like im not even there
2683296 well yeah but he kept brushing me off like i wasnt there
2683297 what did you say to him to get him to stop
2683298 well i just straight up told him that he was being a dick and to stop it
2683299 listen if you arent going to legit correct his behavior and let him know that it upsets you hes just going to think youre joking
2683300 but when i tell him i really am being serious
2683301 yeah i just cant stay mad at him hes so much fun when he isnt being kind of a dick
2683302 ok well seeing as i know how this is going to end heres the advice you are going to ask for and promptly ignore just tell him that its called your sex life for a reason because its yours not everyone elses
2683303 it always sounds so easy when you say it but when im actually in the situation its different
2683304 yeah i know but you have to stick to your resolve or else hes just going to walk all over you like dave did
2683305 well ive got to head out or im going to be late
2683306 i think were going to sit down and have a bit of a talk
2683307 well im going to let you alone now sorry for interrupting your reading
2683308 oh uh yeah its kind of my favorite seat in this place
2683309 its nice to meet you maybe well run into each other again sometime
2683310 she must have been something special if youre still drooling over her like that whats her name maybe i know her
2683311 youd get it if youd seen this girl man i need to find her again
2683312 i would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to you and the family of the victims over this unfortunate incident
2683313 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2683314 yes it was and we all agreed on it you even signed off on it
2683315 on valentines day lawrence king gave his heart but not in the way he thought he would
2683316 if you take more chances youve got more chances to win if you have a low tolerance for risk youve got a lower probability of success
2683317 buck up suck up and come back when you foul up
2683318 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2683319 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2683320 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2683321 maybe it will be quiet in the future im an optimist
2683322 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
2683323 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan
2683324 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province
2683325 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12 people
2683326 cest en voyant une empreinte de main faite dans de la glaise le cadeau f te des m res typique
2683327 im more than happy i did tell them during the week do it on your own time
2683328 be focused and everyone has to be seen that were focusing on the job at collingwood of getting into the finals
2683329 its not good to read in the paper that three of your coaches are being interviewed for jobs
2683330 but i dont mind it happening its just a perception issue and a logistical issue
2683331 i told them i dont want you doing interviews at 12 oclock or one oclock in the afternoon and thats fine thats what happened
2683332 dean laidley was approached by the kangaroos in grand final week
2683333 he came up to me and said i wont go for the interview because were in grand final week and i owe it to the club
2683334 i said you owe it to yourself and i believe you can walk and chew gum at the same time so go down tomorrow and ill ring the kangaroos then chairman allen aylett and say they have our blessings if there is any publicity
2683335 our navy sailors have been assigned the task of preventing arms and other military supplies from reaching georgia by sea
2683336 these reports do not correspond with reality a coastal blockade would mean war with georgia we are not in a state of war with georgia
2683337 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of good will and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2683338 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2683339 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2683340 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2683341 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2683342 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2683343 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2683344 the united states olympic committee is saddened to confirm the death of todd bachman father in law of united states olympic mens indoor volleyball head coach hugh mccutcheon
2683345 mr bachman and his wife barbara were visiting the drum tower in beijing china when they were attacked shortly after noon by an assailant wielding a knife
2683346 their daughter elisabeth was with them at the time of the attack
2683347 mr bachman died as a result of injuries sustained in the attack mrs bachman suffered serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital for emergency treatment her injuries are serious and life threatening
2683348 most of the players called their parents i told them to be strong
2683349 the president has been informed and his heart goes out to the families of the victims
2683350 the white house and us embassy have offered whatever assistance the family needs us officials have also been in touch with chinese authorities on the matter
2683351 serendipity plays such a big role in science always has

2683462 is a worthy lively and very well researched book that entertains as well as informs it richly succeeds in uncovering the truth about the name of the ancient town and smashing unfounded legends while bringing an evolution vividly to life in the process
2683463 local historians were assiduously applied to the task of inventing history sometime since the first european historian did his research in the area and the present jhelum had become the name of alexanders horse i was surprised to discover locally printed histories carrying on and on about famous horse that dies at jhelum and gave the town its name all of these so called histories have been printed in the last thirty or so years which implies that this industry of pseudo history became fashionable in the recent past
2683464 two things are evident one that jhelum never matured as a trading town that whatever scant marchandize could be seen in its bazaars was the leavings of the limited trade transiting through here secondly in the presence of the busier ferries of jalalpur haranpur and even despite its bitter ground water pind dadan khan jhelum was the less preferred crossing point indeed at the point of annexation in 1849 by the british the town contained only five hundred houses that is its population was not much above three thousand souls a far cry from a rich and prosperous town
2683465 he draws his inspiration from the writers of history who treated their subject as a grand denouement of a dramatic plot with historical personages as characters he is thus far away from those academic historians who establish a thesis and then laboriously fill in data to prove their assumptions
2683466 salman rashid is not a historian neither is he a social scientist he basically loves to write about places and people with the zest and passion that is more the forte of creative writing this strength can easily turn into a flaw but he knows when to stop and puts an end to the surge of passion before it freewheels from the umbilical cord of history into fantasy

2683468 dado el incremento de la agresi n por parte de rusia
2683469 rusia ha trasladado a osetia del sur decenas de carros de combate artiller a y hasta cohetes t cticos gran cantidad de infanter a
2683470 anyone who misses the military operations in gaza mustnt worry they will come
2683471 i am aware of the fact that not every resolution is implemented i am aware of the difficulties and despite all this i say with complete confidence that the security council resolution is good for israel
2683472 it is important to state that from the beginning when we understood that in fact these goals had to be achieved by political means and because it was obvious to us that the entire international community understood the cause of the recent incidents and that it was necessary to implement resolution 1559 we ourselves acted to initiate the procedures and resolutions that would promote the goals we had set ourselves
2683473 and assuming that it is implemented compared with the situation that existed before could create a dramatic change in southern lebanon
2683474 even in the last hours before passage of the resolution we wanted to ensure that this embargo would be enforceable and substantive preventing the transfer of arms from these countries to hizbullah in fact to anyone other than the lebanese army now the embargo is part of the un resolution and the terms and formulation of this article are acceptable to israel and express our opinion a proper embargo
2683475 and it is important to say that one way or the other responsibility has been imposed on the lebanese government to ensure that arms do not enter in order to prevent the rearming of hizbullah
2683476 the question has been asked about whether everything is now dependent on decisions or requests from the lebanese government with regard to the international forces from our standpoint any entire process that involves placing power in the hands of the lebanese government so that it can enforce its sovereignty is a positive one which of course creates a genuine change in the situation in lebanon
2683477 it is also clear that the entire process is intended to lead in the end to the disarming of hizbullah not just to the lebanese army moving southward not just to an embargo but to a process completed by the disarmament of hizbullah as was required from the start in the previous resolutions but today we are also creating the way to enforce this process at a practical level
2683478 regarding the international force should it become apparent that the forces that were decided upon are not adequate the resolution opens the way that will allow for improving the mandate and creating a proper force so that it will be more effective with a broader mandate than this one this is already determined in the resolution
2683479 israel of course demanded that the kidnapped soldiers be returned to their families as this was and still is our goal
2683480 in my estimation especially due to the events of the past month the international community as well as the lebanese government understands that israel will no longer accept a situation whereby a terrorist organization sits on its border and fires katyushas at israeli citizens or alternatively attacks israeli soldiers whenever it wants to so as i stated earlier in comparing the political situation on the day before and the chance that this resolution will change the situation in lebanon with the goals we set for ourselves here two days after the beginning of the conflict and what we hope to achieve following termination of the military operation without addressing the question of when and how it will end we have attained most of the goals in the israeli initiative which in effect we placed as the first draft on the table of the international community
2683481 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province brigadier dawson said
2683482 shadow governor responsible for authorising bomb attacks across the province
2683483 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan brigadier dawson said
2683484 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province brigadier dawson said
2683485 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12 people
2683486 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2683487 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2683488 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2683489 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2683490 we have launched an investigation and have found that thieves are bottling the oil adding water and colourants and selling it to township fisheries as cheap cooking oil
2683491 people should be careful where they buy their fried fish and chips or other fried foods from now on
2683492 row is not between jammu hindus and kashmiri muslims as branded by some section of the media but rather a fight of nationalist forces against separatist elements
2683493 you can see hindus sikhs and even muslims out on roads to support the movement
2683494 its a movement of four lakh kashmiri pandits who are bearing the brunt of being refugees in their own country for over 19 years and its a movement of every indian who consider jammu and kashmir as integral part of india
2683495 this public outcry is to throw out each and every separatist out of this country so that people of jammu and kashmir and rest of india could shun fear forever and live in peace and tranquillity

2683497 o was actually supposed to go buy this friday so then we could watch the movie that night while enjoying this
2683498 in no way in the conflict between the russian and georgian military implicated
2683499 in the wake of the aggression launched by the georgian side against the south ossetian civilians and russian peacekeepers a lot of very complicated humanitarian problems have arisen which we need to address in line with our mandate and simply in line with the duty that our state has
2683500 you guys want an independent kosovo okay then support a free south ossetia

2683506 it will be a cause for celebration if maltese athletes achieve better times and results than ever before

2683508 i wish them all the luck in the world and hope that someday we will win a medal shooter william chetcuti may surprise his fellow competitors with his quality
2683509 i come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses and the voice i hear falling on my ear the son of god discloses and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me i am his own and the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known
2683510 he speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet the birds hush their singing and the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me i am his own and the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known
2683511 i urge the russian federation georgia and the separatist south ossetian and abkhaz administrations to immediately enter into a cease fire in order to stop hostilities
2683512 the use of violence contradicts the principles of the council of europe and violates commitments to peaceful settlement of conflicts which are fundamental for achieving the aims of the organisation
2683513 the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia must be respected and all actors on the ground have an obligation to respect the principles of distinction and proportionality as laid down by international law
2683514 i deeply deplore the military action taken by the russian federation towards georgia

2683561 wenn sie gegeneinander antreten m ssen dann treten sie auch gegeneinander an
2683562 zur gleichen zeit in der die spiele in peking mit einem feuerwerk er ffnet wurden musste georgien mit bombenangriffen auf viele seiner st dte leben
2683563 das ist nicht das was die welt sehen will und es entspricht sicher nicht der olympischen idee

2683565 instead more and more were experiencing nature represented technologically through television and other media children grow up watching animal planet thats probably better than nothing but as a species we need interaction with actual nature for our physical and psychological well being

2683614 hij weet niet of hij nog in staat zal zijn om de ploeg te leiden

2683616 ive got double the usual number of orders since the conferenced started this means our company will probably have a surplus at the end of the year and will allow us to continue strong into the next quarter
2683617 im so thankful that many online gaming economy industry heavyweights took time out to come and talk to us ive learned a lot of new things found out industry news and was able to network successfully with others who have jobs similar to mine
2683618 restaraunts night clubs and the mall have all benefitted greatly local retail sales are up nearly 50 and restaurants have nearly all sold out for the next week and a half
2683619 people are buying this online gaming economy stuff like hotcakes im thrilled about the success of these products
2683620 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2683621 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2683622 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2683623 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2683624 the coin must have been done by a professional the work is impressive
2683625 the russian military actions against georgia can lead to worsening of the international relations between russia and the european union eu
2683626 das was ich heute gezeigt habe war grosses velofahren und es war ein grosser tag f r mich weil ich nicht mit einer medaille rechnen durfte
2683627 diese medaille gibt mir f r das zeitfahren ruhe zuversicht und motivation
2683628 warten warten warten auf die grossen nationen schauen und im richtigen moment zuschlagen
2683629 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2683630 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2683631 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2683632 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2683633 in naam van de honderdzestig zwaluwen wiens nestjes samen met de huizen dreigen te worden vernietigd vragen wij als drie priesters roepingshalve opkomend voor bedreigde zwakke waarden niet enkel de nestjes maar ook de huizen te sparen
2683634 niet voor niets heten deze zwaluwen immers huiszwaluwen staan zij niet symbool voor de zovele al nodeloos uit hun huizen verdreven doelenaars tien jaar geleden al deden wij een soortgelijk beroep op het geweten van de betrokken overheid wij herhalen dit nu met evenveel vertrouwen op haar menselijkheid
2683635 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2683636 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2683637 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2683638 maybe it will be quiet in the future im an optimist
2683639 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2683640 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2683641 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
2683642 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product
2683643 so what youre looking at is a truly phenomenal demand in australia for these sorts of drugs in the modern era
2683644 a person working in the bank reported it we have several teams looking for her we have to be certain
2683645 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
2683646 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran and to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
2683647 were facing an economic blockade and this has forced us to take this natural route and march to muzaffarabad
2683648 our produce mainly apples is rotting at least 1 500 truckloads of fresh fruit are waiting to be transported to markets outside kashmir
2683649 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2683650 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2683651 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2683652 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2683653 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2683654 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2683655 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2683656 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2683657 this is an extremely difficult time for all of us that knew and loved ryan and i would ask that we are given the time and space to grieve in private
2683658 i would urge anyone that knows or saw anything to come forward and assist officers from operation trident in their ongoing efforts to trace witnesses to this cold blooded and reckless act
2683659 its going to be a great time for us just to be together not having to worry about making dinner for ourselves or cleaning up after anyone or doing house stuff
2683660 i didnt expect to have to go again this fast
2683661 a lot of people are disappointed that we elected a democratic congress in 2006 to end the war and nothing happened
2683662 but as voters engage they will see this campaign through the presidential race prism and thats something reichert doesnt want i view this race as a toss up
2683663 reicherts big problem isnt himself its president bush this could come down to the wire just like last time
2683664 when it comes to life and death issues politics is not a factor
2683665 he talks kind of moderate even i could vote for him
2683666 but what he actually does is something else he votes far left
2683667 i dont believe in no win wars that are just police actions
2683668 we dont want you to hang out with him or her
2683669 received the word with all readiness and searched the scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so
2683670 and i will continue to refer to them in language that might offend some people because of the beating and torture of my friends
2683671 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2683672 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2683673 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2683674 lamentablement la meva conclusi s que ser molt dif cil si no impossible trobar punts de coincid ncia suficients per elaborar una declaraci conjunta
2683675 calls on all political and social actors to ensure a peaceful climate throughout the electoral process and its aftermath
2683676 i was expecting if you like a more conventional correction that followed the patterns of a straightforward downturn this has clearly been far more than that weve seen massive disruptions of the financial markets particularly liquidity problems which were not anticipated
2683677 possibility of real economic downturn continued difficulties in credit markets
2683678 give lasting effect to the values which are considered fundamental by the people of the united kingdom
2683679 we want to see a bill of rights that would set the bar for the universal standards to which everyone is entitled and fills the gaps in the protection of more vulnerable people such as the elderly children or people with learning disabilities
2683680 it should not be some sort of charter for correct behaviour that would see rights as a reward for fulfilling social responsibilities rather it should be aspirational setting out a shared vision for the future of our society
2683681 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2683682 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2683683 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2683684 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2683685 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2683686 the disease starts in 65 75 years the average length of illness 5 years but there are cases over the slow over 10 20 years
2683687 the effect on my clients on a day to day basis of the failure to prosecute is severe i am sure you will appreciate that my clients were severely damaged as children accordingly they are hurt scared and scarred
2683688 a failure to prosecute and convict would be the ultimate betrayal of them by the government it would be the ultimate rejection of them and of their rights as human beings
2683689 i can quite clearly say that the investigation is being held up there are people on the island who just dont want us going down the route of this inquiry
2683690 she was sort of disturbing other spectators around her which is against the house rules
2683691 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2683692 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered
2683693 in my opinion there are already elements of some of kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2683694 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2683695 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2683696 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2683702 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2683703 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2683704 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2683705 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations

2683707 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2683708 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2683709 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2683710 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2683711 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2683712 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2683713 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2683714 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2683715 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2683716 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2683717 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2683718 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2683719 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2683720 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2683721 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2683722 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2683723 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2683724 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2683725 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2683726 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2683727 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2683728 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2683729 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2683730 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2683731 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2683732 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2683733 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2683734 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2683735 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2683736 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2683737 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2683738 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2683739 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2683740 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2683741 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2683742 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2683743 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2683744 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2683745 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2683746 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2683747 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2683748 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2683749 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him

2683753 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2683754 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2683755 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2683756 do you mind if i park my car inside i m afraid i left the chain and locks at home
2683757 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2683758 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2683759 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2683760 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2683761 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2683762 just so you all know we did set a record
2683763 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2683764 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2683765 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2683766 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2683767 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2683768 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2683769 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2683770 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2683771 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

2683778 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2683779 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2683780 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2683781 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2683782 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2683783 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2683784 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2683785 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2683786 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2683787 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2683788 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2683789 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2683790 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2683791 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2683792 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2683793 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2683794 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2683795 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2683796 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2683797 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2683798 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2683799 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2683800 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2683801 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2683802 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2683803 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2683804 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2683805 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2683806 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2683807 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2683808 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2683809 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2683810 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2683811 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2683812 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2683813 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2683814 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2683815 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2683816 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2683817 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2683818 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2683819 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2683820 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2683821 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2683822 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2683823 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2683824 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2683825 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2683826 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2683827 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2683828 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2683829 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2683830 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2683831 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2683832 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2683833 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2683834 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2683835 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2683836 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2683837 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2683838 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2683839 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2683840 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2683841 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2683842 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2683843 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2683844 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2683845 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2683846 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2683847 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2683848 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2683849 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2683850 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2683851 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2683852 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2683853 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2683854 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2683855 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2683856 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2683857 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2683858 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2683859 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2683860 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2683861 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2683862 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2683863 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2683864 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2683865 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2683866 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2683867 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2683868 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2683869 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2683870 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2683871 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2683872 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2683873 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2683874 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2683875 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2683876 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2683877 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2683878 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2683879 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2683880 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2683881 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2683882 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2683883 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2683884 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2683885 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2683886 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2683887 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2683888 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2683889 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2683890 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2683891 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2683892 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2683893 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2683894 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2683895 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2683896 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2683897 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2683898 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2683899 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2683900 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2683901 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2683902 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2683903 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2683904 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2683905 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2683906 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2683907 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2683908 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2683909 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2683910 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2683911 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2683912 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2683913 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2683914 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2683915 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2683916 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2683917 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2683918 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2683919 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2683920 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2683921 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2683922 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2683923 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2683924 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2683925 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2683926 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2683927 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2683928 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2683929 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2683930 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2683931 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2683932 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2683933 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2683934 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2683935 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2683936 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2683937 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2683938 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2683939 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2683940 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2683941 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2683942 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2683943 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2683944 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2683945 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2683946 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2683947 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2683948 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2683949 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2683950 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2683951 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2683952 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2683953 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2683954 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2683955 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2683956 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2683957 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2683958 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2683959 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2683960 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2683961 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2683962 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2683963 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2683964 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2683965 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2683966 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2683967 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2683968 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2683969 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2683970 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2683971 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2683972 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2683973 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2683974 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2683975 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2683976 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2683977 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2683978 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2683979 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2683980 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2683981 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2683982 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2683983 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2683984 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2683985 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
2683986 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
2683987 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2683988 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2683989 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
2683990 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
2683991 the real point as noticed here by one of americas most prominent one man bloggers is that the brits are actually leading the way in pointing out to the world that american faults are generally over reported and american strengths under reported
2683992 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2683993 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2683994 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2683995 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2683996 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2683997 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2683998 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2683999 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2684000 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2684001 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2684002 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2684003 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2684004 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2684005 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2684006 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2684007 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2684008 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2684009 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2684010 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2684011 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2684012 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2684013 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2684014 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2684015 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2684016 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2684017 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2684018 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2684019 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2684020 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2684021 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2684022 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2684023 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2684024 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2684025 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2684026 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2684027 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2684028 because when we go back home well have a nice tan
2684029 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
2684030 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
2684031 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
2684032 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
2684033 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
2684034 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
2684035 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
2684036 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
2684037 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
2684038 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
2684039 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
2684040 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
2684041 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
2684042 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
2684043 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
2684044 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
2684045 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
2684046 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
2684047 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
2684048 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2684049 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
2684050 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2684051 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up

2684056 it just goes to show that god is universal god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2684057 this is a true testament to the importance you place on relations with china
2684058 i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding the american flag that was pretty cool
2684059 we take this case very seriously and we have already instructed the competent authorities to carry out a serious investigation
2684060 we are definitely seeing way more political videos hitting the internet than in the 2004 election
2684061 the obama campaign understood right from the start about putting videos online and only recently
2684062 but now we have all these response videos and responses to response videos
2684063 mccains ad was one of the craziest things i have ever seen
2684064 to bring paris and britney into the most important campaign in history was ridiculous

2684080 karan played the lead with kareena while i was just the silent producer i made her promise that if and when i produce a film shed have to be my co star i never knew the director for my first feature film would have the same idea
2684081 its an adaptation of a very successful play from britain at this stage id rather not say more because someone is always there to pull the rug from under your feet
2684082 the hit play in britain was directed by a very talented guy called pravesh kumar and now ive hired him to direct my first feature film based on his own play
2684083 kareena suits the role perfectly its almost as if the role was conceived for her shes meant to play the part in fact the play is named after her character
2684084 for many years ive done films to earn money so i could buy my car house and a life in mumbai now i need to build a body of work and just my body

2684086 im working with danny and manoj for the first time and what an experience i yearn to learn from actors who know more than me we bond really well we have to because were all supposed to be locked up in this factory from which we cannot escape
2684087 on monday i paid us 7 00for a pint now all of a sudden its us 7 80
2684088 there is no price list on the wall i dont mind paying more but it is completely arbitrary it is not the money it is the price hike it is outrageous
2684089 in light of these allegations we will be seeking to make contact with the landlord this may well constitute unfair trading procedures and this is something the council would look into
2684090 that should not be the case and it wont be the case as far as im aware there is no change in price there is no difference everyone should be paying the same
2684091 i am planning various projects with them i will however let the producer announce the projects

2684112 my labrador phoebes puppies are now part of farhans household yes he took two of the pups
2684113 it all started when farhan came on my sets and i told him my dog just had pups and would he like one it so turned out that farhans daughter had been pleading with her dad for pups for some time now
2684114 his daughter had come to visit a friend in my building and she insisted on carrying the pup home all the children of the building came and went as they pleased to play with the pups so farhans daughter came up with her friend and insisted on taking it home there and then
2684115 and then farhans wife called up my wife raveena to ask for one more pup as a companion for the first pup im very happy for my dogs because i know the akhtars love pets
2684116 we do form a club together me farhan madhur bhandarkar rakeysh omprakash mehra ashutosh gowariker raju hirani and vipul shah

2684127 the spate of fuel fires in hungary were all extinguished quickly and no one was hurt but they did serve to remind us how potentially volatile pit stops are
2684128 from my point of view a bigger drawback of refuelling is that it detracts from the racing by turning the grand prix into a series of low fuel sprints between pit stops
2684129 in the days pre 1994 when you carried your entire race fuel load on board the car there was a much bigger role for the driver in managing the tyres and brakes you could even opt to run non stop if you could make the tyres go the distance while someone else might pit twice
2684130 and because the cars weight changed so much more in the course of the race there were more fluctuations in performance and handling characteristics which in turn created more overtaking opportunities
2684131 these days in dry conditions you very rarely see anyone win from further back than the second row of the grid because race pace largely mirrors qualifying pace which is not surprising when the conditions are so similar
2684132 i request that you direct paul matters to desist from besmirching my reputation
2684133 please note if these outrageous attacks on my good character do not stop immediately i will be left with no alternative but to pursue legal recourse in relation to paul matters vox fm and its board of directors
2684134 it was quite mundane political commentary and she knows full well the reasons the statement was made

2684136 we are saying she is unfit for office not because of her physical appearance but because of other issues

2684200 i remember laughing as we rode the log ride and screaming as we rode the big dipper for my first roller coaster experience
2684201 unfortunately he died a year later but i will always remember him acting like a big kid that day with us
2684202 oh what fun riding chartered buses from the town square to geauga lake
2684203 the kids would always be on the lookout to see who would be first to see the big dipper ahead
2684204 we told our mothers after the fact and it was then that my mother realized i was getting too big for the kiddie rides
2684205 during the slow times i would visit the fun house with its wooden slides large wavy mirrors and spinning circle
2684206 the big dipper roller coaster the bumper cars the various rides and the games of skill were free with an employees pass
2684207 it was there at geauga lake park that my widowed mother met and married the park security policeman
2684208 after standing in line the two of us flew around the track
2684209 upon disembarking i noted that my boyfriends face was greener than my blouse
2684210 although the rides are gone i will always retain the memories of that day
2684211 estoy contento creo que jugu muy bien a pesar de que las condiciones estaban dif ciles sobretodo por la humedad lo que hizo que la pelota vaya lenta por lo que el desgaste es mayor
2684212 me dio lata esperar pero ya gan y eso es lo que cuenta
2684213 there is no way devi can compete the entries closed on aug 7 for her event
2684214 its very appropriate that it an inconvenient truth got an oscar from the land of make believe
2684215 well this is certainly not up to par with your usual aesthetic
2684216 made the cake in the morning for my husband and i and by that evening it was gone
2684217 well i had this story about two college girls who spend a summer in san francisco but
2684218 gee theres worse things in the world than to spend three months in the summer in barcelona with my family playing a little jazz seeing the sights
2684219 passes as enjoyably as an idle summers afternoon in the titular spanish city
2684220 my favorite thing about the city is its a real city sexy exciting full of energy las ramblas the main street is like mardi gras in new orleans on any night of the week youre out at 4 in the morning and theres hundreds of people out there still in the cafes the clubs theres all this culture and art and great architecture its a combination of the extremely modern with the quaint and the old
2684221 ca iisidre restaurant 12 les flors 12 in the raval district was my favorite place in the city its probably the best restaurant that ive eaten in in all of europe in all the countries ive ever been to its one of those family run restaurants where you feel youre eating with the family that runs it a family that really knows how to cook
2684222 thats how he connects to my film hes not one of those form and function bauhaus architects he is barcelona and he is what makes barcelona the right setting for this sort of story about discovering something about love and your sensuality if the girls in this movie scarlett johansson and rebecca hall had gone to london for the summer while london is a great and beautiful city it just doesnt have that sensual quality it doesnt have the bougainvillea the mediterranean exoticism that gaudis barcelona does
2684223 its so white and spare very spanish and its filled with one dazzling mir piece after another then you go see gaudi who is the opposite all color and detail and whimsy gaudi brings you into the city
2684224 but im coming back to that part of spain some day
2684225 other cities madrid london paris are all incredibly beautiful but those cities feel sober when you compare them to barcelona
2684226 this summer is the first year we were not able to hold back on raising prices people dont realize how the cost of fuel has affected all farmers
2684227 the expenses are rising across the board and most of the farmers have no control over the price they get
2684228 a lot of what may be perceived as profit is eaten up
2684229 we raised our prices a little bit but it doesnt cover the costs
2684230 the cost of feed has gone through the roof and its just trickled down
2684231 the amount of risk you have in that field is considerably higher than it was before
2684232 depending on the hay field a good year is four or five cuttings
2684233 i wanted to showcase different styles in the same piece
2684234 well we have this building thats pretty ugly why dont we just have them paint the building
2684235 what we dont want to do is make graffiti seem like its just really thuggish
2684236 get to really express exactly what they want to do
2684237 it isnt doing anybody any harm its actually probably making the place look a little better
2684238 through this legislation the department of health will have an early warning when a hospital becomes fiscally unstable and will be able to intervene before the fiscal instability gives way to fiscal insolvency and yet another health care facility in the garden state has to close its doors forever
2684239 my understanding is that my client believes she is in compliance with the agreement
2684240 i think wed love to see it be zero but puppies are like babies and at times can get sick
2684241 thats why we have a puppy lemon law and thats why we support it
2684242 clearly there is no follow up and the consent decree is meaningless
2684243 we tried to put them out of business in 1997 but the court ruled against us
2684244 if there are violations of the consent petition we will file a contempt petition and ask the court to provide sanctions and if we have the grounds to shut them down we will ask the court to do so
2684245 the only thing that is acceptable to our family is that you have the kennel shut down
2684246 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2684247 i couldnt believe that i actually felt better not fantastic but better
2684248 and i wanted to know why and i wanted to help others
2684249 someone said to me why are you sitting through all this testimony and i said i dont want to be surprised by anything in traumatic grief thats when your stomach does a flip when you get an intense headache and when you want to go to bed for three days
2684250 well there is no law that says i have to but thats my son aaron whos going to stand for him
2684251 ive gone back and forth in my mind on the death penalty
2684252 if i were the state could i give a lethal injection
2684253 probably not if i had the chance to stop what happened any mother would rip the face off that person but can i do it after the fact im not sure
2684254 out of an abundance of caution on the chance that anyone could get sick
2684255 im not sure that amy has the proper image that ben amp jerrys wants to be connected with
2684256 theres this perfectly nice allegedly a 14 year old girl looks to be about 60
2684257 im surprised that he lowered himself to pick on a child and act like a child himself
2684258 yeah they offered me the role but its not really what i see for myself
2684259 there are at least six other famous women pregnant right now who arent getting picked on
2684260 he told me to wait for the sunbathers and then try to fit in with them
2684261 if you ask me theres a certain amount of racism in it
2684262 for a person with just a mental health diagnosis its near impossible to find an appropriate placement
2684263 its a way to keep myself civilized because the streets will do some damage
2684264 those who hope in the lord will renew their strength
2684265 it shouldnt be as much of a problem to get onto a beach in new jersey as it is
2684266 not only just get to the shore but park there and enjoy the experience
2684267 you shouldnt have to worry about being hauled away in handcuffs for sitting down on a beach
2684268 you have the right to swim in the ocean to get out of it and sit or lie down on the sand
2684269 the turnover is intended precisely to let even more people use and enjoy our beaches
2684270 people expect that there are no go areas but the law doesnt support that
2684271 they knew full well that she had no access to her journalistic work product after they abruptly terminated her
2684272 were going to play on everything good that people know about wysp
2684273 nbc15 will allow me more creativity than i had in philadelphia
2684274 this is not a traditional republican campaign for president of the united states in new jersey largely because we intend to win it
2684275 with numbers like these its very hard for mccain to make up that gap
2684276 i think you need to start off with a much narrower spread at this point to make it a game changer
2684277 this is a state with a large veterans population a state with a lot of seniors and john mccains story appeals to the vast middle of new jersey politics
2684278 were going to win new jersey for john mccain because of what were doing here today
2684279 john mccain looked me in the eye after the hamilton event on the bus and said build a grassroots organization in new jersey
2684280 we believe theres lots of people who may have made a different choice if the battle was between hillary clinton and john mccain but thats not the campaign thats going into november
2684281 that is a really really big incentive to say something has to change
2684282 if i can knock on 10 000 doors to go to the legislature
2684283 we can knock on a whole lot more to send john mccain to the white house
2684284 im not used to i saw an elk and i thought it might jump at the car are they always that big
2684285 alex last winter you had to shove them out of the driveway with both hands to get the car out
2684286 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province brigadier dawson said
2684287 shadow governor responsible for authorising bomb attacks across the province
2684288 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan brigadier dawson said
2684289 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province brigadier dawson said
2684290 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12 people
2684291 fifteen ltte terrorists were killed when the army made a daring advance this morning before first light and without sustaining any damage to our own troops the ministry said
2684292 two civilians including a school teacher were killed four more civilians were injured when the sri lanka air force bombed iranaipalai the tigers said
2684293 if the latter finds merit in the complaints it will endorse the complaints to the proper revolutionary judicial organ for consideration and prompt action it shall see to it that the provisions of the chapter 3 regarding revolutionary justice of the guide to the establishment of the peoples democratic government shall be followed
2684294 the determination of probable cause during preliminary investigation or reinvestigation is recognized as an executive function exclusively of the prosecutor thus the determination of the persons to be prosecuted rests primarily with the prosecutor who is vested with discretion in the discharge of this function

2684307 just because there was not as much enforcement as there should have been doesnt mean we are vacating our rules
2684308 the whole thing is not what you would normally see in a neighborhood thats what zoning laws are for
2684309 i think nobody wants to do the job and i dont know if theyre afraid or intimidated or what
2684310 if theres a density issue we would have to take action does that mean theyd have to remove two statues or five or what
2684311 a political response to the issues that have been brought to the officials attention
2684312 everyone has been saying its a done deal but its not a done deal
2684313 we respect their right of freedom of speech and the right to demonstrate
2684314 but we do expect they will respect our private property
2684315 well respect their right to protest and first amendment right to freedom of speech
2684316 ive never in my 731 2 years ever been arrested as awful as that sounds i would do it
2684317 they want privacy in their rooms and on the phones
2684318 even if they bellow at the top of their voices
2684319 they will say it is only among my friends and i say do you want to go into law or medicine and do you want this information to come back in 20 years time they say they deleted it and they are unaware that the material still stays around
2684320 this may override any thoughts or concerns about the ramifications of sacrificing privacy
2684321 we were warned back in year 10 about putting pictures of yourself on the internet because people would still be able to see them in the future
2684322 people can google you and your facebook can come up and if they can get on to it and see something inappropriate you could lose out on a job opportunity in the future
2684323 we all realise that if you do upload a picture of yourself someone could look at it in the next second and in the time between you uploading and deleting it that someone could have saved it and sent it on to other people
2684324 we have had a lot of education about it at school and you hear about it on the news
2684325 it is our stuff they dont have any right to snoop
2684326 i believe that many young people are aware or are becoming aware through education about the facts that deleted emails messages and photos can be traced or recovered and that lost privacy cannot be restored
2684327 but the unknown or possible consequences of this may not influence their actions as much as we might hope
2684328 intimacy is much easier to create and less risky in a lot of ways than person to person contact connections with many people or groups can be established quickly it is far easier to join a conversation or ask to be added to a myspace page than to approach a person face to face and risk social rejection to an extent you can control the information that others have about you they cant judge you on your looks if they cant see you
2684329 as teenagers we used to put locks on our diaries so nobody could read them
2684330 i would argue that individuals still have to take personal responsibility for the way they allow others to use their information for example even on facebook you can look at the privacy policy and adjust the settings
2684331 so many young people are exposing themselves in ways that later in life they are going to regret big brother contestants are included that footage is forever and people can record it
2684332 a party might look for the cleanest possible candidate one with the least facebook images
2684333 the older generation has to be careful of making presumptions about the attitudes of youth
2684334 the facebook phenomenon could also be seen as a reflection of the fact that a certain openness about ones private life is now accepted as a fact of life for young people
2684335 nos dias de folga fico em casa para fugir do sol

2684337 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2684338 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2684339 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2684340 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2684341 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2684342 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2684343 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2684344 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2684345 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2684346 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2684347 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2684348 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2684349 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2684350 it was moving firefighters from the fire front to a landing site where they were going to be relieved of duty for the night
2684351 its at 1 800 feet elevation in very steep country the salmon trinity alps primitive area
2684352 as it loaded up and the people had put on their seat belts it didnt have a successful liftoff
2684353 two other company choppers responded to the mayday emergency call and dropped water on the ground around the burning aircraft
2684354 they are one of our best contractors as far as job performance and safety
2684355 was on the job all day building a fire line using shovels and chain saws
2684356 jumped in and helped get the survivors out of the wreckage got the medical folks rolling did triage on the four victims evaluated the situations and made some good decisions to help the victims get the treatment they needed
2684357 we have 12 aircraft under contract to the forest service
2684358 were probably the largest operator of firefighting helicopters we fight fires here canada mexico and australia
2684359 this kind of incident is really sad but its also something that will be used to really examine how we can avoid this in the future
2684360 will look at three things the man the machine and the environment
2684361 theyll look at the pilots flight training experience and did he have adequate rest and was he under any particular stress
2684362 and do a stem to stern evaluation of the helicopter components and the engine to see if theres any malfunction
2684363 sudden unexpected shifts in wind is a helicopter pilots worst nightmare
2684364 well supply them with whatever we can to comfort them
2684365 thats the way the fire family works it doesnt matter what part of the fire family it is
2684366 when theres a tragedy like this it ripples throughout the whole fire service
2684367 d rfte das ende in nicht so weiter ferne liegen

2684398 under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2684399 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us
2684400 in one air strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
2684401 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside
2684402 a woman begged the firemen and soldiers to help find her family she said shed gone into the burning apartment block but had not been able to find them
2684403 we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings we saw at least one man pulled out dead
2684404 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2684405 ossettia is georgias territory it has been undermined by terrorists funded by moscow
2684406 this is because russia wants to punish georgia for its democratic stance and its western ties at the moment there are between several hundred and two thousand people dead this conflict is not ethnic its not religious its about russia wanting georgia to be subordinate to them
2684407 it is vital for leaders on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2684408 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2684409 in order to consider withdrawal of our forces we must make sure that there is no chance of genocide there
2684410 there is a straightforward way to stop fighting to stop killing for georgians to withdraw and then to have an agreement on non use of force signed and then we can talk on other verity things including on military and political arrangements
2684411 certain georgian military activity which is supported from outside of south ossetia
2684412 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2684413 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2684414 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures

2684437 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside
2684438 a woman begged the firemen and soldiers to help find her family she said shed gone into the burning apartment block but had not been able to find them
2684439 we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings we saw at least one man pulled out dead
2684440 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2684441 ossettia is georgias territory it has been undermined by terrorists funded by moscow
2684442 this is because russia wants to punish georgia for its democratic stance and its western ties at the moment there are between several hundred and two thousand people dead this conflict is not ethnic its not religious its about russia wanting georgia to be subordinate to them
2684443 it is vital for leaders on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2684444 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2684445 in order to consider withdrawal of our forces we must make sure that there is no chance of genocide there
2684446 there is a straightforward way to stop fighting to stop killing for georgians to withdraw and then to have an agreement on non use of force signed and then we can talk on other verity things including on military and political arrangements
2684447 certain georgian military activity which is supported from outside of south ossetia
2684448 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2684449 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2684450 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures

2684464 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2684465 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2684466 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2684467 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me

2684492 i didnt want to show my face around campus i didnt want to show my face at the football building i didnt want to do anything just stay in my room
2684493 it was really tough it was something that i didnt know how to react to i didnt know what to do with
2684494 it was not about not being hard on himself because i think its a true leader who can take it on his own shoulders
2684495 what i talked to him was that in our building in our practice he and i can never be down period i feel down too sometimes but i told him guys are looking at you
2684496 he did an excellent job this week because i know i know how he felt when you put your own personal feelings and hurting aside because you know everyone is looking at you thats when you know you have a kid who gets it
2684497 i tried to do the best that i could this week
2684498 coach could see the way i walked into the building last week i was down disappointed hurt i was able to sit down with him and he helped me out a lot
2684499 i saw senior captains jeremy zuttah and eric foster and they said you are the leader of this football team
2684500 when i heard that i was like you know what these guys are counting on me and theres a lot of guys counting on me so i had to push everything aside and focus on one thing and that was syracuse
2684501 all these outside things pulling you this way or that way what i learned this week is that all that matters to me are the 120 guys that wear rutgers across their chest
2684502 when you have their support and backing from the guys you work with every day theres nothing that comes close
2684503 our young guys just dont have the game experience yet
2684504 if you want to change youve got to change something its not going to just happen
2684505 you wouldnt suspect in a two minute drill that the lb would be down low like that
2684506 we knew they were going to go to that play we talked about it on the sidelines
2684507 we ran ti underwood on a vertical and timmy underneath weve done it a hundred times as soon as the linebacker turns his hips you dump it underneath on timmy and he wouldve gotten a first down and kept going
2684508 the linebacker turned his hips i took my eyes off him i went to timmy and they made a great play being there
2684509 i saw him run with ti too and i thought it was just me he just turned around at the right time it was a good play
2684510 i don t think it matters they whipped our butt we lost so we shut our mouths and get ready for this week
2684511 but they lost their quarterback marylands jordan steffy to a concussion late in the first half and had to go with their backup chris turner so you cant expect people to feel sorry for you
2684512 its a hard feeling for me especially with how hard we worked
2684513 whenever we come up short like this its one of those feelings you have to swallow and come back to work next week

2684529 i disapprove of the moa because pgma will use that opportunity to perpetuate herself beyond 2010 cha cha
2684530 in an interview with abs cbnnews com newsbreak teresita ging deles former presidential adviser on the peace process said the planned shift to a federal system would allow the arroyo government to include other agenda items on charter change including a shift to a parliamentary system
2684531 when you open charter change can you say its only up to this point
2684532 you can try a law establishing greater powers in the bje after all the concept of an autonomous government is in the constitution in fact the complaint is that the law that was passed is not real autonomy
2684533 thats why im saying when people should be happy with this breakthrough it becomes so suspect because the actions of the leadership raise so many questions on her real agenda
2684534 is this peace making by improvisation or is it cha cha not for peace but for political survival
2684535 i oppose the moa because it is unconstitutional i e it offends sovereignty and territorial integrity i e will led to the dismemberment chop chop of our country
2684536 the grp milf moa on ancestral domain will give rise to a chop chop republic as the creation of the bangsamoro homeland with its own people territory and form of government will dismember the philippines
2684537 under the moa the president had effectively ceded part of the territory of the philippines to the milf
2684538 ancestral domain does not form part of the philippines public domain
2684539 obviously gma ms arroyo is not empowered to give up any part of our country to any group only the filipino people can do that in their sovereign capacity and only via amending the constitution
2684540 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2684541 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2684542 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2684543 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2684544 lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water
2684545 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2684546 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2684547 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2684548 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2684549 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2684550 the chemical industry just wants to protect its own interests
2684551 la l gica de un pensamiento es como un viento que nos impulsa en la espalda una serie de r fagas y de sacudidas
2684552 what was found was the remains of a brick structure and also a cobbled surface both probably of 19th century date
2684553 we dont know exactly what they are because there isnt a sufficiently large enough area exposed for that to be determined if those remains were to be impacted on there is sufficient interest to require further investigation and recording
2684554 i recommend a programme of further archaeological work be made a condition of any planning permission that may be granted for the scheme
2684555 they could find the base of the old welsh bridge or st georges bridge under there because it came out opposite mardol
2684556 in my mind i have a goal and my goal is to be at my best on that night which will bring me the gold medal

2684558 if youre going to beat me youre going to have to go 12 7 low 12 7
2684559 ive had some people that work here at the university say that they feel like ill win
2684560 he trusts his training hes extremely confident and excited for the challenge that is dangerous with an athlete like terrence you dont put a tiger like that in a corner he wants to come out fighting
2684561 i bought the mask i had from home here and it didnt do much because it was like a painters mask from ace hardware
2684562 so i went to the medical unit on the second day they were like do you have a mask i was like yeah this is my mask right here they said nah nah thats for spray paint i was like give me one thats for running then so im good now
2684563 its raised expectations that it wont deliver on its failed to live up to those expectations and they will be punished
2684564 its always very dangerous to try and extrapolate state results onto federal results
2684565 i dont draw too much into the territory result and i wont draw too much from the western australian result other than to say it will be a tough election
2684566 my observation was that issues of a federal nature even things like petrol prices did not figure largely in the election campaign itself
2684567 the northern territory like every state has its own unique circumstances and the things that matter to people in the territory are often very very local
2684568 paul henderson i think is a very very strong leader for the northern territory hes a very committed hard working young leader so it will be interesting to see what the final seat count is
2684569 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2684570 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2684571 ill be making those the points in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to a death penalty
2684572 ill make enquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of a death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes
2684573 a lot of my friends are sardarjis im very fond of them for their lifestyle and daring ive never done a film that would hurt any communitys feelings quite frequently i get rid of potentially funny scenes when i feel theyre offensive i want to distribute love not hatred through my cinema
2684574 i personally approached major sikh communities to watch singh is kinng they pointed out scenes that were not quite right we recalled akshay kumar from south africa and re shot those scenes then the sikhs were quite happy
2684575 our intentions cannot be doubted people who saw the film on wednesday say singh is kinng is better than my no entry and welcome my wife thinks this is my best work to date and my children love it thats a relief if people in my home dont like a film how can i expect people outside to like it
2684576 ill say only one thing ive made a very good film its a much bigger film than my no entry and welcome but i wasnt thinking of those films while making singh is kinng i didnt want to repeat the earlier formula for the first time ive incorporated action scenes in my cinema i dont like action but because of akshay we had to include it
2684577 i go before the release of all my films and spend four five days in ajmer sharif im able to overcome my nervousness there
2684578 i dont make four films a year i make one film every two years so ive no immediate project to fall back on ive put my entire life in singh is kinng
2684579 vipul loves and respects me thats why he approached me id love to do another film with him if vipul didnt have confidence in me why would he let me direct hed have done it himself
2684580 i normally shoot one film at a time its because of my producer vipuls planning that i could complete and release singh is kinng eight months after my last release welcome
2684581 abbiamo fatto un errore madornale a seguire garibaldi e i savoia ora dobbiamo rimediare io non mollo non me ne andr dalla politica fino a quando il nord non sar libero
2684582 con la sinistra abbiamo trattato per il federalismo vediamo se mantengono la parola mi auguro che il nuovo sistema politico sia approvato ma non spendete tutti i soldi
2684583 se non approvano il federalismo dovete venire a roma in massa per far sentire la vostra voce se non c il federalismo c la lotta di liberazione
2684584 i am planning various projects with them i will however let the producer announce the projects
2684585 indian film industry especially bollywood has grown tremendously and their growth has been a lesson for the world i will be really happy to work for the industry
2684586 i have been listening to various singers and artistes in india and found them to be excellent
2684587 it is my first visit to india and i am very happy with the warm response we have received from the people here

2684590 karan played the lead with kareena while i was just the silent producer i made her promise that if and when i produce a film shed have to be my co star i never knew the director for my first feature film would have the same idea
2684591 its an adaptation of a very successful play from britain at this stage id rather not say more because someone is always there to pull the rug from under your feet
2684592 the hit play in britain was directed by a very talented guy called pravesh kumar and now ive hired him to direct my first feature film based on his own play
2684593 kareena suits the role perfectly its almost as if the role was conceived for her shes meant to play the part in fact the play is named after her character
2684594 for many years ive done films to earn money so i could buy my car house and a life in mumbai now i need to build a body of work and just my body
2684595 in acid factory producer sanjay gupta and director suparn varma have given me a completely new look i havent ever grown my hair to shoulder length i better do it now or soon itd be too late
2684596 im working with danny and manoj for the first time and what an experience i yearn to learn from actors who know more than me we bond really well we have to because were all supposed to be locked up in this factory from which we cannot escape
2684597 never take your own revenge beloved but leave room for the wrath of god for it is written
2684598 my labrador phoebes puppies are now part of farhans household yes he took two of the pups
2684599 it all started when farhan came on my sets and i told him my dog just had pups and would he like one it so turned out that farhans daughter had been pleading with her dad for pups for some time now
2684600 his daughter had come to visit a friend in my building and she insisted on carrying the pup home all the children of the building came and went as they pleased to play with the pups so farhans daughter came up with her friend and insisted on taking it home there and then
2684601 and then farhans wife called up my wife raveena to ask for one more pup as a companion for the first pup im very happy for my dogs because i know the akhtars love pets
2684602 we do form a club together me farhan madhur bhandarkar rakeysh omprakash mehra ashutosh gowariker raju hirani and vipul shah
2684603 were free to like each other personally and dislike our works when vipul shah was releasing namastey london he showed me the film and asked for my honest opinion ive very close friends in the industry like aamir khan and prasoon joshi
2684604 i got the idea a while back itd be nice to see present day politics with a smile on the face its a genre i havent attempted
2684605 the year i got the golden filmfare ramesh sippy had got his lifes first filmfare award ever can you imagine the maker of sholay hadnt got a filmfare award for 35 years
2684606 we have won the case as the court has ordered a permanent injunction on the scenes which mock the actor now we are planning for a criminal case
2684607 we will be filing the case against the makers of the movie monday under sections 499 and 500 which says defaming a person advertently either through words print movies or any other medium is a criminal offence
2684608 we are lucky that our wish was fulfilled by salman bhaiya brother he invited us to mumbai met us and we tied a rakhi on his wrist
2684609 salman bhaiya also promised us to give chance to participate in 10 ka dum show hosted by salman
2684610 i have accepted the invitation i am very happy to be part of it it is a wonderful country and incredible is the fitting word for it
2684611 we will be coming out with an ad campaign and a road show to promote indias tourism it will highlight the culture and heritage of the country which are the usps of our country
2684612 we should show our hospitality india is famous for it even if there are some incidents we should take steps to sensitise people
2684613 each social work is different through this i want to remind people how great is our country and want to sensitize our people i want to tell them what we are we are warm and hospitable people we have to protect those who are visiting our country we must ensure that they have a good time and come back again
2684614 i am an entertainer and will continue to do good work i am part of it because i want to spread social message
2684615 after the movie lagan wherever i go i used to meet people who were interested in visiting india
2684616 terrorism is against everyone we should be united we are for peace and if there is one bomb blast we should light a billion candles

2684618 on monday i paid us 7 00for a pint now all of a sudden its us 7 80
2684619 there is no price list on the wall i dont mind paying more but it is completely arbitrary it is not the money it is the price hike it is outrageous
2684620 in light of these allegations we will be seeking to make contact with the landlord this may well constitute unfair trading procedures and this is something the council would look into
2684621 that should not be the case and it wont be the case as far as im aware there is no change in price there is no difference everyone should be paying the same

2684624 for the past few years we have gotten an extraodinary number of orders of t shirts gifts and collectibles with recovery related cartoons i think it is because people in recovery tend to have a good sense of humor about life and themselves and like to poke fun at themselves
2684625 it is not unusual to receive an email from a customer or a recepient of a gift from a customer who received one of our items and compliment us on it that makes me feel good
2684626 we didnt really date we were just really good friends

2684640 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2684641 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2684642 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2684643 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2684644 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2684645 doping charges have been dropped against her but the indian olympic association ioa wont be able to send her to beijing on the ground that time is very short and they wont be able to re open the entry process for her
2684646 we have beaten china more than once in recent past and hence it was quite disappointing to lose to them we did not play to our potential today
2684647 it was not a match that we could not have won a win was quite a possibility but things did not go according to our plan and the pressure of performing in olympics the biggest stage got the better of us
2684648 it was an ok sort of performance by the archers nothing special
2684649 ishant has got a right gluteus buttocks muscle contusion it has been confirmed by an mri scan he too is not being able to bear full weight on that side
2684650 sachin has got a swelling in the left elbow joint and that is confirmed by an mri scan his elbow movements are not comfortable at present
2684651 laxman also performed mri scans and has got a left ankle sprain
2684652 the current noticeable weakening in the yuan has never happened before
2684653 previously when the dollar rebounded the yuan would either move sideways or appreciate more slowly
2684654 we have crossed three lakh units since inception in india to commemorate this achievement we are launching a sports variant of sedan civic
2684655 all those times goofing around in my front yard i always put myself here in angel stadium
2684656 it was my first start here but in my head id done it a million times i felt really comfortable out there
2684657 he didnt show it but im sure on the inside he was probably a little nervous
2684658 you cant ask for him to do anything more than he did he was outstanding
2684659 he probably could have played friday if he had to but i thought it made more sense to make sure it was right theres a lot of things you do on your legs as a catcher so i wanted to give him the extra time
2684660 felipe alou used to talk about that bring em in but dont let the other team see them too long
2684661 i feel better from the right side than from the left side
2684662 but today in that particular at bat in the seventh inning i was feeling my legs as a hitter thats what you want you want to feel your legs and see the ball and hit the ball there are times you get caught up in thinking too much
2684663 jerrys gonna put guys where it is best for the team i have no problem with that
2684664 jag kan alltid sl tillbaka men jag kan inte f tillbaka min f rlorade sj l
2684665 it may have occurred to clay that his apparent middle of the road position invited attacks from both sides of the slavery question
2684666 it was an apology for his better self formerly he had spoken as a born anti slavery man who to his profound regret found himself compelled to make concessions to slavery now he appeared as one inclined to deplore the attacks on slavery no less if not more than the existence of slavery itself
2684667 freed slaves would flood the north compete with white laborers and drive down their wages or the country would be convulsed by interracial warfare as blacks and whites sought to preserve the purity and separateness of the races
2684668 it is not better for both parties that the existing state of things should be preserved instead of exposing them to the horrible strifes and contests which would inevitably attend immediate abolition
2684669 providence will cure all abolition nothing it may ruin all it can save none
2684670 i beseech the abolitionists themselves solemnly to pause in their mad and fatal course
2684671 amid the infinite variety objects of humanity and benevolence which invite the employment of their energies let them select some one more harmless that does not threaten to deluge our country in blood
2684672 so spontaneous so sincere so fervent that some wondered if another political alliance between northern money and southern cotton had been struck
2684673 i heard the senator from kentucky with pleasure his speech will have a happy effect and will do much to consummate what had already been so happily begun and successfully carried on to a completion
2684674 calhoun assigned to him a place in his church on the bench of the penitents and the candidate for the presidency took the insult without wincing
2684675 once idolized clay now cast him off as something loathsomely hypocritical
2684676 i expected it would enrage the ultras more than ever against me and i have not been disappointed
2684677 the speech bears all the marks of that careful weighing of words characteristic of a candidate defining his position on a delicate subject
2684678 i trust the sentiments and opinions are correct i had rather be right than be president
2684679 the immortal utterance the classic rejoinder one that quickly entered the lexicon of american politics and was always associated with clays name
2684680 moderation conciliation and decision but above all firmness and decision should be our course may it be guided by wisdom and lead to victory
2684681 clay had gone too far in his attacks on abolitionists
2684682 also had a hand in engineering his own defeat his senate speech on february 7 1839 against the abolitionists more than any other single factor undoubtedly prevented him from gaining a single northern state at the convention except glorious rhode island i had rather be right than president clay had announced so be it responded the delegates
2684683 whether that will appease her supporters remains to be seen
2684684 will voters accept hillary clintons nonapology her vote to authorize the use of force in iraq might cost her the presidency
2684685 for a windfall profits tax to fund 1 000 emergency rebate checks
2684686 that the likely republican nominee and others in the gop would try to scare voters by saying the democrat
2684687 it is not to barack obamas advantage to make this a big issue
2684688 it is simply not acceptable to the majority of people including many of those who may be sympathetic
2684689 the main thing about roosevelts appeal is hes remembered by most people as an image and a style
2684690 sooner or later just about every republican who runs for president will invoke t r
2684691 usually though they dont know what theyre talking about mccain is more serious about it i think hes got more justification
2684692 contemporary republicans are well to the right of where roosevelt was in 1912 in terms of their view of the power of government
2684693 its not about experience experts say voters may take issue with a lighter resume but presidents judgment called key
2684694 its not about experience experts say voters may take issue with a lighter resume but presidents judgment called key
2684695 john quincy adams understood the world but he didnt have a political gene in his makeup
2684696 he understood then how you take risks and use your political judgment
2684697 its not about experience experts say voters may take issue with a lighter resume but presidents judgment called key
2684698 the presidency has too many moving pieces trying to gauge whether experience matters really eludes measurement
2684699 its not about experience experts say voters may take issue with a lighter resume but presidents judgment called key
2684700 he was then universally criticized for being a micromanager in the white house
2684701 obama opens platform to rank and file as focus turns to economy
2684702 hillary clinton and barack obama truly agreed on virtually everything
2684703 too fit to be president facing an overweight electorate barack obama might find low body fat a drawback
2684704 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist i think theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
2684705 akhirnya terbukti bahwa air yang benar benar murni adalah air embun alami yang didapat melalui sdp
2684706 winning over the women is a real challenge this will be a sad day when hillary clinton steps down for a lot of people because a whole generation of women thought it would be possible in their lifetime to see a woman administer the american state
2684707 they will have to ask themselves are they even angrier now than when george bush was elected in 2004
2684708 even though barack isnt responsible for the sexism hillary has experienced many people supporting him have done it
2684709 this is perhaps the second greatest moment in african american history symbolically right up there with the abolition of slavery
2684710 it will have tremendous effect across the world overnight the world will exhale and say my god america has done something different unprecedented
2684711 they thought they were going to knock obama and everybody else out of the box with the first few primaries and caucuses and they were just dead wrong
2684712 because hillary clinton voted for the resolution in 2002 authorizing president bush to use military force in iraq there was always the likelihood that there would be a significant anti war challenger to her in the democratic primaries and that a lot of the activist base of the party would rally behind such a challenger so the premise that hillary was a kind of inevitable nominee was always questionable
2684713 obamas race is just one factor that makes him more accessible to younger voters
2684714 theres something about the sophisticated and complex ethnic identity that resonates with younger voters as well
2684715 younger people are able to say we and that we includes barack obama
2684716 there have been times in the obama campaign when i think i wish dad couldve seen that or i wish my mother were here to just see him holding his own
2684717 she can certainly run an i told you so campaign four years from now and she might have a strong chance to win the nomination then
2684718 so i think that actually helps her in terms of her future the partys not going to blame her if things go wrong in november
2684719 it is this belief this optimism that senator obama and i share and that has inspired so many millions of our supporters to make their voices heard
2684720 obviously i am thrilled and honored to have senator clintons support but more than that i honor her today for the valiant and historic campaign she has run she shattered barriers on behalf of my daughters and women everywhere who now know that there are no limits to their dreams and she inspired millions with her strength courage and unyielding commitment to the cause of working americans our party and our country are stronger because of the work she has done throughout her life and im a better candidate for having had the privilege of competing with her in this campaign no one knows better than senator clinton how desperately america and the american people need change and i know she will continue to be in the forefront of that battle this fall and for years to come
2684721 senator obama is a perfect manifestation of a september 10th mind set he does not understand the nature of the enemies we face
2684722 first of all i think there is an executive order out on osama bin ladens head and if im president and we have the opportunity to capture him we may not be able to capture him alive
2684723 franklin reminisces about how his mother encouraged him as a youngster to tell people he wanted to become
2684724 so far fetched so incredible that we used to really have fun just saying it
2684725 he has shown an ability to bridge the divides in our society and unite people behind his agenda for change
2684726 im very much in favor of public financing however the existing public financing law has been flawed from the start the main problem with the public financing system for nearly the last 30 years is that it became too easy to get around it
2684727 the presidents partner the first lady in the 20th century
2684728 michelle obama makes appeal to women voters co hosts the view potential first lady attempts to soften image as husband fights for critical votes
2684729 she needs to relax show she has a sense of humor and is someone who can laugh at herself i see michelle obama taking advantage of more of the opportunities of the white house making speeches on causes important to her and see cindy mccain taking on a more traditional supportive spouse role
2684730 one comment made off hand might be easily misinterpreted by the opposition
2684731 barack obama is the nominee of our party he is a bright committed energizing young leader i met with him yesterday in chicago and i pledged to him then as i had previously that i will work my heart out for him and that ohio will work her heart out for him
2684732 today barack obma has revealed himself to be just another typical politician who will do and say whatever is most expedient for barack obama the true test of a candidate for president is whether he will stand on principle and keep his word to the american people barack obama has failed that test today and his reversal of his promise to participate in the public financing system undermines his call for a new type of politics
2684733 john mccain has visited every one of these countries post primary that i have
2684734 so it doesnt strike me that we have done anything different than the mccain campaign has done which is to recognize that part of the job of the next president commander in chief is to forge effective relationships with our allies
2684735 she did not think the historic brandenburg gate was a suitable venue for a political event by a traveling american
2684736 i urge the chinese government to release tibetan political prisoners account for tibetans who have quote disappeared since protests in march and engage in meaningful dialogue on genuine autonomy for tibet
2684737 a clear message to iran to end its illicit nuclear program
2684738 we rejected the audacity of hopelessness and we were right
2684739 defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
2684740 id love to give a speech in germany but id much prefer to do it as president of the united states rather than as a candidate for president
2684741 quit talking about did the surge work or not work or did you vote for this or support this
2684742 get out of that were done with that how are we going to project forward
2684743 because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others and it began the anbar awakening
2684744 a surge is really a counterinsurgency made up of a number of components im not sure people understand that surge is part of a counterinsurgency
2684745 im here on this trip to reaffirm the special relationship between israel and the united states and my abiding commitment to israels security and my hope that i can serve as an effective partner whether as a u s senator or as president
2684746 rode past an israeli checkpoint into ramallah on the west bank
2684747 i think he wants maximum flexibility to be able to to do what he believes needs to be done inside of iraq but keep in mind for example one of gen petraeus responsibilities is not to think about how could we be using some of that 10 billion a month to shore up a u s economy that is really hurting right now if im president of the united states that is part of my responsibility
2684748 by admitting that his plan for withdrawal places him at odds with gen david petraeus barack obama has made clear that his goal remains unconditional withdrawal rather than securing the victory our troops have earned
2684749 prime minister maliki told us that while the iraqi people deeply appreciate the sacrifices of american soldiers they do not want an open ended presence of u s combat forces the prime minister said that now is an appropriate time to start to plan for the reorganization of our troops in iraq including their numbers and missions he stated his hope that u s combat forces could be out of iraq in 2010
2684750 when you win wars troops come home hes been completely wrong on the issue i have been steadfast in my position
2684751 the kennedys moving into the white house in 1961 was a cultural bombshell you had this beautiful glamourous young couple with small adorable children plus the kennedy mythology behind it for irish catholics it meant we made it there will be as there always is a downturn after the initial honeymoon and it will be a test of the african american community as to whether they can deal with him being treated like anybody else
2684752 when you read obamas book the audacity of hope or when you hear his 2004 speech to the democratic convention
2684753 thats a much more centrist vision than what we saw in the primaries
2684754 he gets lots of local ink out of them in places where he needs to do well
2684755 bush failures may force mccain obama to make like fdr in 2009
2684756 what a burden the next president is going to confront
2684757 bush failures may force mccain obama to make like fdr in 2009
2684758 going to wake up very quickly to the fact that the economy so overwhelms everything else
2684759 barack obama lands in afghanistan on first leg of world tour
2684760 if obama says he represents a new politics hes certainly smashing an old paradigm by going
2684761 and for 10 days hell own the media its gigantic for him
2684762 this is one of those things that is high risk but he has no choice
2684763 if he pulls this kind of trip off it is a huge payoff because this is his only real weakness at this point
2684764 theres also been a flap about senator obamas decision in germany not to visit the troops at landstuhl he now says that based on what he was hearing from the pentagon there was no way that wouldnt be seen as a political trip which is why he decided not to go do you accept that explanation
2684765 well i know this those troops would have loved to have seen him
2684766 in landstuhl germany when i went through i visited the hospital
2684767 there was nothing to prevent him from going if he went without the press and the media and his campaign people but well see what happens
2684768 i think people make a judgment by what we do and what we dont do he certainly found time to do other things
2684769 my assessment is that the surge has not worked and we will not see a different report eight weeks from now
2684770 as with the griffith film many moviegoers accepted david o selznicks 1939 movie as historical and social truth even though gone with the wind merely repeated many of the earlier movies caricatures in a more up to date style and in technicolor
2684771 one character in the film called them the simple minded darkies
2684772 gone with the wind was a barometer of american race relations in the 1930s and 1940s
2684773 eliminated practically all the offensive scenes and dialogue so that there is little material directly affecting negroes as a race to which objection can be entered
2684774 given the popularity of the novel and the ineffectiveness of the few protests staged against the film there was little else that the naacp and other groups could have accomplished
2684775 i for one have no desire to produce any anti negro film in our picture i think we have to be awfully careful that the negroes come out decidedly on the right side of the ledger which i do not think should be difficult
2684776 just a few days before selznick suddenly abandoned his fight mcdaniel had filmed scenes that would have required her to use the term it was clearly absent in the final cut long after the filming of gone with the wind was complete it was widely reported that mcdaniel had refused to deliver lines containing the offensive epithet
2684777 never specifically claimed responsibility for changes in gone with the wind
2684778 the most faithful of faithful souls is scarlett oharas ever scolding but ever loyal mammy who stays with her mistress through good times and bad through the civil war and after
2684779 in some sense hollywood is always participating in this fiction the star system especially during the first half of the twentieth century fed off of audiences willing beliefs that performers were more or less authentically reflected in the roles they played
2684780 this rigid typing was the cause of a downturn which met hattie mcdaniels career following her oscar victory mcdaniel had averaged ten films a year between 1934 and 1938 her roles were so small and so similar that she could finish shooting each quickly and move on
2684781 when i read the book gone with the wind i was fascinated by the role of
2684782 if her character in gone with the wind did succeed in breaking new cinematic ground as some have argued then it was due to hattie mcdaniels reinterpretation of the role
2684783 a performance that if merit alone rules would entitle her practically to co starring
2684784 selznick predicted that the actresss contributions would leave a sensational impression on film audiences
2684785 hattie is the happiest person around these parts for she knows she turned in her very finest performance to date
2684786 mcdaniels coveted role of mammy to which she brought the dignity and earnestness that made her more than a servant
2684787 something about all the hoopla bothered him where does this negro artist go from here he asked why back to playing incidental comedy maids of course with the film factorys rock solid racial barriers hattie mcdaniels future he believed was bleak hollywood had no intention of providing her with any real opportunities to use her talents i dont think it will be easy for me to laugh at hatties comedy in the future he stated for ill never be able to overlook the tragic fact that a very great artist is being wasted
2684788 the nuances of emotion from tragedy to comedy with the sincerity and artistry of a great actor
2684789 the birth of a nation was such a barefaced lie that a moron could see through it but gone with the wind is such a subtle lie that it will be swallowed as truth by millions of whites and blacks alike
2684790 agreed the production was historically flawed and unflattering to african americans they contended that it was not egregious enough to campaign against it
2684791 this was an opportunity to glorify negro womanhood i am proud that i am a negro woman because members of that class have given so much
2684792 without miss mcdaniel there would be no gone with the wind
2684793 we trust that discrimination and prejudice will be wiped away in the selection of the winner of this award
2684794 the evening would be as radiant as the oz of the wizard of oz so magical that nothing could spoil it not even a small band of demonstrators outside the hotel protesting against the racism of gone with the wind
2684795 hattie mcdaniel must have felt a surge of nerves and excitement this daughter of ex slaves who had struggled with poverty and racial oppression had finally broken into the highest ranks in hollywood ascending further than any african american had in the world of white show business
2684796 it is with the knowledge that this entire nation will stand and salute the presentation of this plaque that i present the academy award for the best performance of an actress in a supporting role during 1939 to hattie mcdaniel
2684797 clark gable shook her hand and vivien leigh kissed her
2684798 they gushed self consciously over the award and its recipient
2684799 en masse the entire audience stars in every place stood and cheered their beloved hattie mcdaniel tears came to mammys eyes as she made her way to the stage to accept the award
2684800 enthusiastic to the point of defensiveness in its coverage of her award
2684801 some day hattie may thrill your souls with a modern mother role glorifying race youth
2684802 mcdaniel was important insofar as she was opening doors for more varied roles for black performers not insofar as she had given the best supporting performance of 1939 in a glossy hollywood feature about white people
2684803 despite the oscar she was still regarded as a type not as an actress
2684804 the differing responses of black and white audiences to mcdaniels oscar shed significant light on the relationships during this volatile period among hollywood moguls black performers and the american public black and white
2684805 gone with the wind and hollywoods racial politics making gone with the wind meant dealing with fierce criticism from black newspapers and public officials
2684806 but things is changin nowadays an mammys gettin bored hattie mcdaniel and the culture of dissemblance
2684807 took place during a volatile and often explosive period in american history between the berkeley free speech movement september 1964 and the student riots in paris may 1968 between the assassinations of martin luther king in memphis april 4 1968 and of robert kennedy in los angeles june 5 1968 between the march on the pentagon october 1967 and the bloody protests at the democratic national convention in chicago august 1968 between the tet offensive february 1968 and the my lai massacre march 1968 and the escalating protest against the war in vietnam
2684808 the evils of capitalism the plight of blacks and the perfidies of the military industrial complex
2684809 the students who joined sds ccc and anti war groups and who became sufficiently persuaded of the complicity of the university in the perpetuation of whatever evil they were protesting to move to shut it down were a minority in a minority
2684810 had student protesters wanted immunity in exchange for not directly challenging the presidents disciplinary authority but it was precisely the latter that the protesters wanted
2684811 how to get the sds moving again and screw the university all in one fell swoop
2684812 absolutely committed to an impossible yet galvanizing dream that of transforming the entire student movement through this particular student revolt into a successful effort to bring down the system
2684813 april began the escalation of student resistance that would mark this spring as the most explosive period up to that time in the history of american universities
2684814 rallies marches teach ins and sit ills climaxing in a one day student strike on april 26
2684815 it was a demonstration of significant proportions probably as many as a million students stayed away from classes and yet somehow its impact on the public was slight
2684816 proceeded to declare the service an obscenity given columbias systematic mistreatment of blacks and workers king had lost his life championing
2684817 his actions in the chapel were akin to the takeover of socialist meetings by nazis in weimar germany
2684818 this would not be the last time this analogy was invoked in the weeks that followed
2684819 listed three nonnegotiable demands that sds had settled on the cessation of gym construction columbias withdrawal from the ida and no disciplinary action against the low six
2684820 marked a new departure for sas which until now had avoided involvement in any campus issues that were not directly related to the circumstances of black students
2684821 the largest student strike in the history of the country
2684822 a democratic decision making event proposing a future student strike
2684823 take a hostage and occupy hamilton hall the main classroom building of columbia
2684824 took their revolutionary style and dress their beards and berets from che guevara
2684825 dupee wrote to unite the politics of a guerrilla chieftain with the aesthetic flair of a costumer and an interior decorator
2684826 meyers 2003 hamilton hall became a closed occupation and several dozen armed black activists were invited mccaughey 443
2684827 that an ongoing occupation of hamilton now dubbed malcolm x liberation college should be a blacks only project
2684828 we believe that any differences have to be settled peacefully and we trust that police action will not be used to clear university buildings
2684829 protesters slept in the presidents office smoked his cigars drank his sherry and rifled through his files for politically incriminating documents life inside the liberated buildings was tense but passionate sleepless yet amusing
2684830 we went out on the balcony and the university chaplain proclaimed us children of a new age there were flowers there was cake they took us out and marched us around campus with people banging on pots and pans someone had keys to a faculty office and they gave us a honeymoon suite
2684831 the effective united front among all the variety of sdsers was neatly symbolized on saturday night when three sds leaders addressed a crowd of antiwar marchers who collected outside the university gates mark rudd ted kaptchuk and tom hayden
2684832 with major facilities of the campus held by student radicals a growing national interest in the students revolt and the threat that residents of harlem might decide to intervene president kirk gave the police permission to remove the students on april 30 eight days into the occupation
2684833 the very future of the american university depended on punishing the strikers
2684834 it was like deciding to take an airplane ride and having to leave everything in the air to the pilot
2684835 we all gave passive resistance and were dragged out heads were banged clothes were torn some people were bleeding nothing serious though
2684836 bottles flashlight batteries furniture and anything else they could get their hands on at the oncoming police
2684837 a phalanx of police charged the spectators in the south field forcing them to retreat south and west until they were backed up against ferris booth hall and butler library
2684838 even those of us who were intellectually ready for police action were not emotionally ready for what we saw
2684839 the new york police department received the highest number of complaints ever received for a single police action this was also the largest police action in the history of american universities
2684840 my god how could human beings do a thing like this
2684841 the whole world is in these books how could they do this to these books
2684842 do you think they will know why we had to do this to call in the police will they know what we went through before we decided
2684843 placed a poster in ferris booth hall which warned of showdown no
2684844 can an administration which helps make weapons for vietnam steals peoples land and homes discipline anyone
2684845 were in no mood to be pushed around by rowdy college students students threw bricks rocks and bottles at the lawmen the police gave no quarter it was a bloody wild fight

2684848 sale 440 441 many of the radicals left the university after that spring while others were suspended for the most destructive actions including mark rudd who soon became the leader of the violent radical group the weather underground
2684849 the incident immediately ignited a number of student power demonstrations on campuses throughout the united states fueled more by antiestablishment sentiments than by specific attainable goals
2684850 we just manufactured the issues the gym issue is bull it doesnt mean anything to anybody
2684851 conservative critics were right for the wrong reasons when they argued that if the university had given in on these demands the radicals would have found three others just as urgent or in the words of a famous berkeley slogan the issue is not the issue
2684852 how clinton and obama boosted feminism civil rights the primary contest helped both of the historical causes though some tensions erupted
2684853 both obama and hillary clinton have transformed what people from all walks of life believe is possible

2684856 mccain ad asserts his hatred of war senator shifts tone to draw moderates
2684857 to me the ad is much more playing off bush than playing off obama
2684858 the point of this is for mccain to say im very different from my predecessor even if i want to fight the same war
2684859 there is a line between scurrilous nonsense and serious discussion that laps over especially in this day and age when youve got all this electronic media and these blogs and this kind of fanatical impulse to bring down the opposing candidate
2684860 that andrew jackson was a polygamist that grover cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child that james g blaine was a corruptionist
2684861 these things go in cycles the public gets tired of one approach to politics there is always a measure of optimism in this country so they turn to the other party
2684862 open seat elections are somewhat different so the referendum aspect is somewhat muted mccain would be in much better shape if bushs approval rating were at 45 to 50 percent but the history is that in party candidates are not penalized or rewarded to the same degree as incumbents
2684863 i cant think of an upset where the underdog faced quite the odds that mccain faces in this election
2684864 truman didnt face as difficult a political context as mccain

2684871 we in wayne county are not seeing values decreasing plummeting down
2684872 i like to say that weve been blessed because when you pick up articles and you read those i think those are national articles
2684873 we knew at some point those coastal values would have to plummet and that market would drop
2684874 its absolutely true in some counties there has been no aggregate change franklin county is an example of that
2684875 theres an update year where using sales data the value of the property will be adjusted
2684876 we dont have the discretion to change values until our schedule comes up
2684877 its another set of eyes looking over what auditors do
2684878 its another set of eyes looking over our taxpayers expenditures
2684879 those values should be fairly close or real close to what the market is
2684880 the state monitors that and if i submit values that are low theyre going to say no
2684881 im actually surprised how fair some of the taxes are for the homes
2684882 with some of the older homes the 1900s homes or even the 1960s homes youre seeing them sell for more than what the tax valuation is because in some cases more work has been done
2684883 you invest in a property your property is the most valuable thing you own
2684884 therefore youve invested money in it you need to upkeep that property and the value will increase and when you sell it will sell for more
2684885 the auditor tries to do a little better job of trying to appraise a home closer to market value
2684886 theyve been doing a better job of trying to get a better appraised value
2684887 i certainly would hope that they property values continue to increase
2684888 to my knowledge the ivy league and patriot league are the only other conferences in the ncaa that have struck an agreement like this
2684889 i think this will really help both of our leagues
2684890 any time a policy is adopted i think there are good things and i think there are bad things
2684891 im in favor of being in a conference and playing everybody once ive said that many times we havent had that policy it is what it is
2684892 getting into the uaa agreement on one hand its really exciting because you get to play teams like washington university weve always played case maybe at some point carnegie mellon and university of chicago
2684893 the other side of it that can be a little bit challenging is the travel not only from a time standpoint but from an expense standpoint i think there are good things and bad things as there are with most anything you can think of
2684894 its almost like theres a non conference game and then we get a week off and start the season again
2684895 redick became a starter at the end of last season and the other guys are certainly all in the mix to earn starting positions
2684896 defensive line coach jeff tibbs accepted a job at heidelberg and we were fortunate enough to bring in willis barringer to the staff
2684897 were very excited about having him join our staff well be able to break up the secondary by having chris craig coach the safeties and willis will coach the corners that will be important because our secondary is pretty young
2684898 we have around 35 freshmen which is probably a little smaller than what weve had but the quality we think is very good
2684899 weve got some guys who we feel can come in and make an impact early and thats not necessarily easy to do at some of the positions because we do have some older guys
2684900 hopefully ill be able to make a living out of it
2684901 if i play a pretty good first year then i should have a good chance of moving on from there into bigger leagues
2684902 they have a phenomenal product the classic thing its basically a super easy way to track your business expenses and get reimbursed for things you spend
2684903 its all online you dont have to buy software or download anything we loved their application
2684904 an incredible horrible expensive high carbon process of managing what amounts to usually the second biggest spending in a company
2684905 an online tool that helps people find and purchase the services they need
2684906 think of it as a concierge for your life that not only finds schedules and manages your services but also automatically makes sure all the details are on your calendar sends invitations to your friends and colleagues and notifies you when anything changes
2684907 having been out to wooster a couple times now i love the work ethic there i love the fact that they are just absolutely passionate i love the culture they developed
2684908 so frankly were thinking about keeping all of them in wooster and doubling or tripling the head count
2684909 we have to hire high credentialed folks and so forth
2684910 vast majority of positions are fairly high level and fairly high paying
2684911 we are creating this sort of small it cluster her in wayne county which is going to attract more knowledge workers to our county
2684912 i think its an encouraging sign for wayne county especially long term
2684913 that wind is blowing and theyre going down the track
2684914 is doing the hand pump car you know like in the old movies
2684915 my husband dean and i own one of the track cars
2684916 run it on the west virginia central and all different kinds of locations where you can run them
2684917 a lot of us in the club have a lot of different railroad related hobbies
2684918 one man builds velocipedes like a bicycle for a railroad track
2684919 ive seen people who work on the railroad wearing them
2684920 this is the first time they ever rode on a train
2684921 we go out and just help people being safe around highway rail grade crossings
2684922 all of us are part of it were all in it together

2684928 the room we had last year wasnt big enough for alexs seminar
2684929 we had to set up chairs in main room and we counted over 700 people for his talk hes got kind of a comical act and he says he calls anything that goes into rut but hes a big time turkey caller

2684940 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2684941 the front loaded commission is attractive and there is a 12b 1 fee annual trailing commission paid to the broker as well

2684963 ive seen sex and the city twice already it pushed all the buttons it made me laugh made me cry to be honest i felt quite traumatised by it all
2684964 in a way seeing the four women in sex and the city and how the story of their lives had moved on reminded me of the spice girls and how weve moved on
2684965 i especially got into their promotion of teaching women about safe sex and about not being afraid to carry condoms
2684966 for lawn fertilizing to get stuff to flourish its probably as effective or more effective in some cases
2684967 a natural product it is made from organic manure call it worm poop it is lawn fertilizer and virtually has no environmental impact safe to use around kids and pets once you apply it it is safe to walk on after that
2684968 a lot of times when they say cautions its because it is an irritant if you keep it on your skin long so when you do handle it like any product because it is a manure product or its a fertilizer product so you dont want to leave it on your hands its concentrated
2684969 its natural insecticide soaps that will help eliminate some of the insects that go on to your products if you have vegetables and fruit and they eat the leaves it will help eliminate some of those

2684975 back in india do you know we had to sit on the floor then the teacher used to slap our palms with a ruler w ith a ruler
2684976 do you know when we first came to america and your father was working the night shift he had to take the bus back and forth because we didnt have a car
2684977 you know beta back in fiji we used to use one soap for everything taking a bath washing our hair doing the laundry everything everything
2684978 back in nepal we had so many water shortages i couldnt do my laundry for weeks i had to wear the same clothes 5 or 6 days in a row five or six days
2684979 back in nepal taps were often dry i had to go for days without bathing for days
2684980 back in nepal we had 40 hours of load shedding per week we didnt have the luxury of having electricity 24 7 i had to take a candle into the bathroom to go pee it was complete darkness complete darkness
2684981 back in nepal i used to walk almost 2 hours everyday from home to work and back in heavy pollution uneven sidewalks roaring traffic and with cows monkeys and sadhus everywhere everyday
2684982 back in nepal people carry steel pipes and large sheets of wood on their backs even up the hills on their backs
2684983 if we started dipping the whole cinnamon bun in icing reasonably than just icing the top would you buy more of them
2684984 the corporation will have somebody make this product so people can try it and give their opinions if enough people like it a new product is born
2684985 but if they asked me whether i would like one delivered to my house at exactly 7 00 am every morning i would realize that my compulsive self could not tolerate the daily temptation

2684994 i was just working on trying to put the ball in play i put the barrel on the ball i had a good swing and got a good pitch and it went out for me
2684995 it felt good we did well as a team tonight we battled as a team guys put good swings on the ball and we had a big inning we were able to come up with two out hits
2684996 it just takes one guy to get us going you know
2684997 brewer did a great job there were a bunch of guys who had great at bats dave adams jahdiel santamaria some great at bats we got some guys who see some pitches and get pitch counts up there and get them tired
2684998 if someones not going to get the job done someone else will it just made the game more exciting for the fans
2684999 were playing a lot better so keep on doing this for the rest of the season
2685000 may not be able to get over this one guys but the rubber chicken lunches have been nice so weve got that going for us
2685001 yes but you obviously cant do that since youre already here
2685002 there were times in practice i was wondering if i made the right move
2685003 to be totally honest with you i didnt know the jets were 4 12 last year until i got up here
2685004 id just like to beat the guy for a change
2685005 the knock on him was that his arm wasnt that strong so what i can throw it through a wall but i dont win every game i play in it doesnt matter hes very effective
2685006 hes a good player and were going to face a lot of good players and hes definitely got some insight into the things we do
2685007 theres going to be a lot of excitement and a lot of comparisons
2685008 as an activist i think i probably made my legacy because now women are competing in trap and skeet
2685009 i think this increased the opportunities for women and participation of women hopefully that will go on for generations
2685010 as long as you have your passion age does not matter
2685011 shooting is a big part of my life i love to compete
2685012 ill shoot for sure for another year and then it will be 40 years that i have competed at a world level after that i may still shoot or i may turn to coaching
2685013 we are in a tough pool and we will be happy to finish in the top eight
2685014 the feedback was tremendous from them overwhelmingly positive and it actually led to a very successful upfront for nbc
2685015 that was all very much fun and nice but whats going to happen later on this year when leno goes to abc and kicks conans ass
2685016 but we really believe in the decisions weve made with our partners including jay and well really be standing by them because we love the talent we have on nbc and we love the franchise that we have on nbc and we think theres opportunity for a lot of great talent to play
2685017 when we made the deal with jay four years ago we made a long term deal with him
2685018 weve been talking to him for pretty much that whole time about the future beyond the tonight show we cant force him to do something were presenting him with a number of opportunities that we think would be great were hoping he eventually thinks that theyll be as great as well
2685019 but the star of the show is the car so that was a case where it felt like low hanging fruit to bring in an automotive partner on a certain level because you know theyre going to be part of that show no matter how you look at it
2685020 i was very intrigued with the idea of doing a character based drama set in los angeles that revolved around explosive moments in peoples lives that came out of seemingly mundane events
2685021 it definitely wouldnt be information that was intended for him or for anyone for that matter
2685022 the information you are in possession of is obviously sensitive and sharing that outside of you having it now could jeopardize the safety of members
2685023 im not sure what the call out was for but i dont want to see somebody get hurt over this
2685024 it seems like a rather significant screw up im not sure if the screw up is with bell or aliant the provider of our pager or whether its even related
2685025 i think his number was probably put in there in error
2685026 im sure there is limited information as to what you need to bring and where you need to meet

2685080 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us
2685081 i do not rule anybody completely out at the moment so everything is possible
2685082 i am confident and have belief the team will be focused and treat twente with respect
2685083 we have learned through our experience and i am confident we can qualify
2685084 you always expect good opposition in holland but i believe we are good enough to get through
2685085 at the moment he is with us and we have no formal offer from anybody
2685086 i may let one or two go on loan because they need to play it is part of education
2685087 it is not especially to get premiership experience but to play in the first team every week with that pressure
2685088 then when we feel they are ready to integrate in the first team they come back
2685089 today we were very young but i in the end we learned what it is like to defend what we are not used to and in the end it was a good lesson for us
2685090 overall i am pleased because we lacked a bit of experience but we got a positive result with 1 1 even if overall sevilla had many more chances

2685095 that was a great team effort another record and one for me as an individual
2685096 im so happy to be a part of this quartet which has gone faster than any other british team in history
2685097 im not even going to take an aspirin because i dont need it because i want to mark my limits and get a feel for them
2685098 i hated those pictures of me when i was 15 so much
2685099 i had to have my hair short for school and i felt like a boy
2685100 my father was a gardener and worked in the royal nursery so having my picture taken with the flowers being grown especially for the queens bouquet was an incredible opportunity and an honour i just loathed my hair in the pictures so much i didnt want to show anybody
2685101 thats why from then on i vowed to grow it
2685102 when i got married at 20 years old it was passed my shoulders and by 30 it was hitting the floor
2685103 with five children it was a pain and i remember grabbing my pony tail in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other and going to chop it all off once but i saw how long it was and couldnt bring myself to do it
2685104 since then ive worn it in a tight bun so not many people knew quite how long it was and i only take it down twice a year to give it a wash with baby shampoo its the best product for stopping it getting tangled which is great as it takes between two and three hours to comb as it is
2685105 i have to do it with my fingers as brushes just get caught up in it and then i lay it out across the garden on a sunny day and wait for it to dry
2685106 people think washing it every six months means its dirty but its in great condition as your hair is designed to clean itself with natural oils these people who wash theirs everyday are destroying it
2685107 its thinned over the years and i had made myself a secret pledge that i would have it all cut off for my 70th

2685208 all banks are going through kind of a tough time and so are we interim president and ceo barry backhaus said in an interview last week
2685209 you always expect once in a while some years to come along that dont work out and this is one of them
2685210 i knew it was going to go down i just didnt know the bottom was going to drop out said kobs who bought 210 shares after the bank went public in the 1990s over the years she plowed her dividends into buying more stock
2685211 quiet period mandated by securities regulators prior to release of such a report vantus leaders last week declined to discuss financial details but backhaus said the banks performance is starting to turn around
2685212 safe and safe rating system uses 22 tests to measure a financial institutions capital adequacy asset quality profitability and liquidity
2685213 well capitalized as defined by applicable regulatory definitions bankrate com said the firms ratings are designed to be a supplement for consumers rather than a replacement for the federal deposit insurance corp system which insures deposits up to 100 000 per person
2685214 a one star rating is not indicative of an institution in danger of failing mcbride said
2685215 as long as your deposits are fully protected by insurance you have no capital at risk
2685216 adequate rating bauer financial rates institutions on zero to five stars with five the highest no other local institution rated by bauer received a rating lower than four stars according to a check of the firms web site
2685217 as with any agricultural areas i think the economy here is generally fine and has avoided the boom bust we see in arizona parts of california and parts of florida as well as the stagnation we see in parts of michigan indiana and ohio oja said
2685218 he was the best choice all the way around curry said
2685219 many schoolchildren learn how rivers meander and form ox bow lakes but these processes are still very poorly understood when it comes to submarine channels these channels are built by currents carrying large volumes of sediment and seem to be far more stable and far less likely to meander or form ox bow lakes than those on land
2685220 the sands and gravels deposited by these sub sea giants have in many cases trapped valuable accumulations of fossil fuels
2685221 what the companies have to do is make estimations using very limited data anything that can give them a clearer picture of where to find the oil and gas will be very valuable
2685222 an individual production well may cost over 50m so understanding and predicting the distribution of the different rock types that hold these hydrocarbons is critical for optimising well type and location and therefore producing more of the oil
2685223 in most oilfields they dont manage to recover all the oil and gas in some cases most is actually left in the ground from both an economic and an environmental point of view it makes sense to get as much as you can out
2685224 understanding the differences between submarine channels and rivers will enable improved geological models and enhanced oil production from these giants of the deep

2685246 the north koreans dont like to hear the term human rights but that does not mean that we shouldnt raise it

2685250 we should not justify suicide bombers we are against the suicide bombers but we must understand what drives these young people to such actions they want to liberate themselves from such a dark life it is not ideological it is despair
2685251 the palestinian people feel that they are living the hours before dawn their national will is stronger in reaction to the challenge they do not have another option but to continue to carry the hope that they are going to have a normal life
2685252 against barbarity poetry can resist only by confirming its attachment to human fragility like a blade of grass growing on a wall while armies march by
2685253 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanize and i think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe
2685254 but now i think that poetry changes only the poet

2685265 you knew 30 40 minutes before the game they would be there smiling and cheering
2685266 the first thing she would do is apologize to the player for hitting somebody
2685267 and it wasnt sarcastic it was a genuine remark a reflection of wizs parents
2685268 they had just as much fun watching wiz play volleyball as wiz had playing volleyball
2685269 she was so happy that her parents were going to be there and she was going to get to spend some time with them

2685279 re establishing our flagship platform as an unquestioned leader in blogging
2685280 i dont know if you noticed this last week house speaker nancy pelosi turned the lights out on congress while the republicans were talking she killed the microphones and turned the lights off yeah yeah the republicans called this outrageous except of course for senator larry craig who called it romantic
2685281 its being reported that barack obama may name indiana senator evan bayh as his vice presidential running mate tomorrow tomorrow thats what heres what we know about evan bayh he was going to run for president then he dropped out after getting less than 2 of the vote less that 2 he was actually losing to low fat milk
2685282 and barack obama now says he is open to offshore oil drilling so apparently when he promised change he was talking about his mind i guess thats what that was
2685283 well barack obama and john mccain have both switched their positions on offshore oil drilling they both used to be against it but now they say they are for it under the right circumstances like if it helps them get elected
2685284 the tide has finally turned the polls in the presidential race are tied in that barack obama is winning by slightly less people are finally seeing this guy for what he is a slick hope salesman getting by on platitudes like his timetable for troop withdrawal in iraq and his 15 point health care plan its all so vague
2685285 obama is pro inflation what an elitist now to highlight what a charade proper air pressure is the mccain campaign has started handing out barack obama energy plan tire gauges you see its a great way to drive home what a ridiculous plan this is plus its an easy way to check your tire pressure and that can save you a lot of money thats not just me talking the governments own website says that proper tire inflation can save up to 12 cents a gallon immediately so thank you for the tire gauge senator mccain and good work you stuck it to all the left wing nut jobs who advocate proper tire inflation radical liberals like your potential vice presidential nominee florida governor charlie crist arnold schwarzenegger joe lieberman aaa and the pinkos over at nascar i have had my eyes on those guys ever since they had that car sponsored by the aclu

2685505 het is een goed teken dat werknemers de sfeer en collegas missen
2685506 deze factoren zijn erg belangrijk en onlosmakelijk met elkaar verbonden op de werkvloer men brengt ten slotte de meeste dagen van de week door op het werk hierdoor is het ook niet verrassend dat werknemers de regelmaat missen in een werkweek zit een duidelijke structuur die vaak tijdens een vakantie wegvalt

2685509 sadly so far none of darwins letters to beddoe have been found there are no fewer than nine sets of calculations in which darwin and his son george who was just about to take up a fellowship in cambridge combined and reanalysed the data

2685515 its not good to read in the paper that three of your coaches are being interviewed for jobs
2685516 but i dont mind it happening its just a perception issue and a logistical issue
2685517 i told them i dont want you doing interviews at 12 oclock or one oclock in the afternoon and thats fine thats what happened

2685558 they need time to think time to process new found emotions and time to make decisions about their future they need time to just be to move freely between boyhood and manhood returning several times in the initial flush of adolescence to a state of boyhood where theyll spend time playing while reflecting at a deeper and often completely invisible level on the fact that theyre in the process of leaving that boyhood behind

2685567 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2685568 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2685569 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2685570 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2685571 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2685572 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2685573 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2685574 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2685575 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2685576 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2685577 who are open to doing something on the production side
2685578 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2685579 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2685580 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2685581 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2685582 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2685583 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2685584 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2685585 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2685586 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2685587 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2685588 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2685589 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2685590 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2685591 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2685592 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2685593 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2685594 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2685595 the way its going i think well definitely top what we took last games
2685596 its pretty much spread across the sports its good starting with the swimming weve got a lot of gold medal chances in the pool
2685597 once they start aussie punters go into a bit of a frenzy because they are just given so much information
2685598 of course in this day and age you can see so much and evaluate it for yourself
2685599 football betting has slowed right down since the olympics started
2685600 from a global bookmakers point of view it doesnt really make it too good for business because the time zones are bad for practically most of the world
2685601 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2685602 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2685603 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2685604 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2685605 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2685606 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2685607 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2685608 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2685609 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2685610 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2685611 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2685612 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2685613 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2685614 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2685615 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2685616 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2685617 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2685618 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2685619 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2685620 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2685621 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2685622 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2685623 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2685624 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2685625 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2685626 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2685627 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2685628 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2685629 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2685630 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2685631 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2685632 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2685633 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2685634 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2685635 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2685636 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2685637 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2685638 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2685639 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2685640 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2685641 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2685642 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2685643 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2685644 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2685645 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2685646 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2685647 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2685648 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2685649 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2685650 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2685651 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2685652 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2685653 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2685654 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2685655 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2685656 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2685657 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2685658 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2685659 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2685660 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2685661 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2685662 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2685663 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2685664 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2685665 godaya take your harem with you and clean that place up
2685666 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2685667 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2685668 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2685669 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2685670 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2685671 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2685672 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2685673 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2685674 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2685675 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2685676 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2685677 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2685678 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2685679 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2685680 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2685681 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2685682 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2685683 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2685684 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2685685 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2685686 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2685687 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2685688 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2685689 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2685690 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2685691 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2685692 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2685693 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2685694 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2685695 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2685696 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2685697 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2685698 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2685699 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2685700 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2685701 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2685702 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2685703 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2685704 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2685705 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2685706 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2685707 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2685708 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2685709 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2685710 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2685711 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2685712 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2685713 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2685714 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2685715 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2685716 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2685717 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2685718 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2685719 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2685720 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

2685723 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2685724 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2685725 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2685726 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2685727 in coming weeks the hsc examinations will also begin for drama music and language students as they undertake the practical component of their exams acting education minister john hatzistergos said
2685728 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2685729 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2685730 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2685731 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2685732 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2685733 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2685734 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2685735 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2685736 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear

2685743 it was almost a complete reversal of last seasons opener away at ipswich when they scored in thirty seconds and finished the game at a canter and we did exactly the same today
2685744 we learned our lessons from last year the previous start is dug deep within everybodys minds and we wanted to eradicate that memory and try to get that first win under our belt
2685745 we couldnt have hoped for a better start burnley spent heavily over the summer and they are a good side you could see that with spasms of the game and they can hurt you the start we had though was fantastic we never gave them a minutes peace and to get a goal so early was brilliant
2685746 people know that akpo sodje can be a talisman and what effect he can have for this football club
2685747 it showed so quickly he ruffled a few feathers in burnleys camp and he was a catalyst for our three first half goals
2685748 we are waiting for news on his injury though he will have a scan but it looks like his hamstring after he pulled up very quickly it doesnt look clever but i wouldnt want to put a timescale on it before he has the scan
2685749 there were some great performances out there and marcus tudgay had a fantastic game for us it is not his favoured position and he doesnt really like playing there but he never argues about it and he gets on with the job he scored a couple of goals and his work ethic was tremendous
2685750 james oconnor couldnt really have had a better debut for every ball to be contested he was there along with sean mcallister
2685751 they might not be very tall but the pair of them worked so hard they were like ferrets around a drainpipe
2685752 i think the defending was nothing short of na ve
2685753 you would certainly have never envisaged being 2 0 down within three and a half minutes brian laws will be delighted for sheffield wednesday but from our point of view they were really soft goals
2685754 i can accept being beaten and i can accept somebody working really hard to score a goal against you but i dont think sheffield wednesday had to work particularly hard for any of their goals and i left the players in no uncertain terms about that
2685755 at half time we asked them to take the game to sheffield wednesday at the start of the second half which they did and we had a few opportunities but couldnt quite get the goal to make it 3 2
2685756 then again we lost a goal from a throw in
2685757 it was schoolboy defending and it is clear that if they dont come up to the levels we expect they we will get other players in there wasnt 4 1 between the teams but weve learned a harsh lesson so it is what we take from that and how we bounce back from it
2685758 if it means changing the personnel then well do it people will be well aware that we are trying to strengthen at the back and well continue to do that
2685759 clarke carlisle was a big miss at the back and i thought there were maybe three pass marks within the team
2685760 i thought martin paterson did well stephen jordan did well and wade elliott played well but you are not going to win games with three players doing well and if you had told me on friday night that only three players would have pass marks then i would have begged to differ
2685761 our low cost model should in fact on a relative basis give us the advantage that weve historically had if things get difficult

2685774 there are elements in pakistan that one worries about and they had connections to the militants in the region but the country remains a strong us ally she added
2685775 there are also clearly efforts that we think are not working to have deals if you will or negotiated solutions to the militant problem but the point is that these militants are as deadly and dangerous for pakistan as they are for afghanistan
2685776 i think were taking a pretty bold stand and by the way the pakistanis themselves understand that they need to take a bolder stand

2685849 during the middle of summer he comes up to me and says coach ive got a linebacker meeting
2685850 hes calling meetings on his own to get in and watch tape of california thats the biggest change i see
2685851 last year as a freshman you dont even think about being a leader and now he knows people look up to him now hes calling linebacker meetings i just hope he doesnt mess em up
2685852 i just want to get better game to game year to year and i feel like im ready to take on a leadership role
2685853 the pre snap read is so crucial you have to make the read and communicate it quickly at the same time kaleb was great at that and i want to be as good if not better some day
2685854 i can flip a switch when i get on the field
2685855 i wouldnt say im nasty but you do have to play football you cant be too softspoken
2685856 no doubt about it hes intense when he gets on the football field
2685857 but he has the talent to just play ball just play ball and then when someone needs to hear it he knows when to open his mouth hes not a constant chatterer on the football field at all hes a quiet lead by example guy until its time and he knows when its time
2685858 with people running away from me last season i wasnt able to use all my abilities but me being in the middle theres not a way you can actually run from me
2685859 he was great when he was in the box playing the run so it makes sense at middle linebacker youre going to be in the box most of the time play to his strengths a little bit more
2685860 taking what you watch and applying it to the game
2685861 the defense is waiting for me to get the call right
2685862 i am setting the tempo and i believe if the tempo is off its my fault
2685863 made a lot of plays out there hes very noticeable
2685864 return to tiffany heart lock charm necklace 120 mira mesa
2685865 i want to show that i can get it over for strikes a lot of guys are lunging and shooting for that fastball thats why ive been giving up homers theyre out front chasing it recently i havent been getting my breaking ball over too well i threw some pretty decent ones tonight
2685866 my fastball isnt triple digits but im still in the 97 99 mph range and thats pretty good its just a matter of working on that breaking ball and getting to my arm to 100 percent slowly but surely it his arm is getting there
2685867 he has such late movement on his fastball and he has a sweeping breaking ball
2685868 i hope to face some live hitters wednesday and be activated friday
2685869 things could change if it doesnt feel good on monday
2685870 there wasnt a lot of mental errors a couple times we had an assignment error where we didnt block the right guy but mostly we know who to block now its just about executing each and every down
2685871 we had eight more minutes which is critical for a speed defense
2685872 if you are fast and were not overly big but were really fast the more time you can control that thing its going to help them
2685873 and its their job to get off on third down it all works together if they get off on third down then it starts buying you clock time
2685874 they are just working me in to see what i can handle what they gave me was pretty good
2685875 i dont think the goal is for me to be at my absolute best against the 49ers or cleveland in exhibitions i think the goal is indianapolis
2685876 im just going to do whatever they want me to do whatever they tell me to do
2685877 i came back and i played like six weeks later
2685878 it was a mistake coming back so i went on injured reserve for a few weeks then i played the last seven or eight games
2685879 this is just a personal experience williams is younger than i was but i think if i would have taken the whole year off gotten my stomach and core strength back my career would have lasted a lot longer
2685880 i want to eat out of your ass for the rest of my life
2685881 you break the u s resistance and youve made a big breakthrough on a global scale
2685882 effective immediately overcrowded airports will have the flexibility to vary charges based on time of day
2685883 we will not achieve this eco efficiency or indeed survive as profitable entities if punitive taxes charges and unfair trading schemes continue on their present trajectory
2685884 add in 30 in taxes and fees and you have less than 30 per ticket to run the rest of the airline
2685885 excesses by markets bring the pendulum swinging back toward government
2685886 if you have an itinerary beyond labor day go online and make sure that flight is still there
2685887 theres no requirement that get them on the next flight or a specific flight
2685888 its a combination of rising prices and the reluctance of the u k consumer to spend money
2685889 this is the result of the more cost conscious travelers beginning to adapt their behavior to the glaringly obvious increase in what is already an expensive service relative to others and one which is discretionary for many
2685890 airtran has no unused lines of credit available and substantially all of its assets are encumbered
2685891 they really need to take out 12 to 15 of capacity
2685892 the market for selling eagle right now is probably not too good
2685893 british airways and american airlines need to complete a transatlantic deal to link operations if they are to win the fight against high fuel costs and thwart rival alliances
2685894 we will continue to take actions to increase our revenue and decrease our costs while preserving our culture and core product integrity
2685895 the entire team continues to impress me with their ability to find new ways to do things better and more efficiently helping us mitigate rising fuel costs
2685896 if you are in richards airline you are going to be close to where richard is located
2685897 now we have to combine an lcc with a premium carrier which of course works with different it and sales systems than a network carrier we will create something new that the industry had not seen before
2685898 need to see a workable plan so their investment makes sense
2685899 it appears to me that the midwest fleet is no longer needed
2685900 to make sure we have the cash level necessary to operate
2685901 we will remain true to our mission of serving major business destinations with more nonstop flights from milwaukee than any other airline
2685902 noncompliance issues within wns maintenance program to go undetected for years
2685903 has violated four different ads eight times since december 2006 including five in 2008
2685904 faa management fostered a culture whereby air carriers were considered the primary customer of its oversight mission instead of the flying public resulting in a pervasively negative although unintended impact on its oversight program
2685905 hes got to evolve the airline much more rapidly than herb ever had to because of the changing market changing costs and changing fuel prices
2685906 so you could have many more destinations being added to midway by one or two code share partners
2685907 united shares have fallen too fast and furiously implying a higher risk of near term bankruptcy than justified in our view
2685908 we need to get the job done and show up with results
2685909 without acquiring something either a full partner or significant assets the road will get harder
2685910 rather than become marginalized they could sell what theyve got and distribute the proceeds
2685911 if us airways cant find some way to grow they are probably going to contract
2685912 with neither low costs nor a global network creating an uncertain future
2685913 us airways still lacks critical mass so i wouldnt be surprised if they look at an asset acquisition
2685914 a program of intimidation to pressure your captain to reduce fuel loads
2685915 these eight pilots have routinely been above the 60 to 90 minute range it just behooves us as a company to talk to these guys figure out what theyre seeing that were not
2685916 es ist zu begr en dass justizministerin berger die anzeigepflicht fallen l sst und der weg f r eine weiterentwicklung der gewaltschutzgesetzgebung frei ist
2685917 die vp soll bei so einem wichtigen thema jetzt nicht blockieren sondern zustimmen und nicht auf dem r cken potentieller gewaltopfer wahlkampf betreiben
2685918 flexible modelle wie tagesm tter d rfen nicht benachteiligt werden
2685919 das muss aber nicht unbedingt nur der klassische kindergarten sein
2685920 gerade in den europ ischen l ndern die daf r bekannt sind dass dort die kinderbetreuung im vorschulalter besonders gut ausgebaut ist wie zum beispiel in frankreich hat sich gezeigt dass man mit flexiblen modellen wie tagesm tter und v ter mit kinderkrippen mit wahlfreiheit f r die familien mit gutscheinmodellen wesentlich erfolgreicher ist als mit starren systemen deshalb fordern wir die verantwortungstr ger in bund l ndern und gemeinden dazu auf sich diese erfolgreichen modelle genau anzusehen bevor sie sich auf eine einzige betreuungsart festlegen
2685921 es handelte sich um angelinas erste szene an ihrem ersten drehtag sie hat sich mir vorgestellt und sagte lass uns anfangen wow lacht ich fand es okay und wie immer bei solchen szenen eher peinlich aber bestimmt nicht sexy auch wenn das im film so aussieht
2685922 ihre bodenst ndigkeit sie macht sich st ndig lustig ber sich selbst am anfang war ich schon sehr eingesch chtert aber nach ein paar minuten nahm sie mir durch ihre art meine nervosit t um sie herum habe ich keinerlei begleittross gesehen und das obwohl sie von presse und paparazzi regelrecht verfolgt wird sie ist wirklich total relaxt und ziemlich normal und man kann viel mit ihr lachen ich habe gro en respekt vor ihr
2685923 ich verk rpere absolut das klischee lacht mein geld ist auf der royal bank of scotland mein scheckbuch tr gt das schottenmuster ich trinke nur schottischen whisky und ich habe einen kilt unter dem ich nichts trage
2685924 ich stamme aus einer arbeiterfamilie und war in der schule faul nie h tte ich mir tr umen lassen schauspieler zu werden erst als ich sp ter eine schauspielschule besuchte eigentlich wollte ich fu ballspieler werden und ein schiff besitzen deshalb berlegte ich sogar der marine beizutreten verr ckt heute kommt f r mich kein boot mehr infrage weil ich schnell seekrank werde
2685925 ich war schon ewig nicht mehr wandern oder campen und habe keine zeit mehr f r fu ball mit meinen kumpels jetzt nachdem ich den tolstoi film the last station in deutschland abgedreht habe werde ich eine pause machen und die zeit zuhause verbringen ich gehe oft ins kino liebe musik von rod stewart und lese gerne
2685926 keinesfalls ganz einfach weil ich in meine frau verliebt bin die brigens auch schauspielerin ist sie hei t anne marie duff wir sind seit november 2006 verheiratet und leben in london in der tv serie shameless spielten wir ein paar und wir wurden auch in echt eins
2685927 genauso wie ich sehr relaxt wir nehmen das alles nicht so ernst es ist toll dass mich manche attraktiv finden aber ich will definitiv nicht anfangen zu swingen lacht
2685928 niemals ich vertrage die hitze nicht wenn es hei ist kann ich nicht mehr denken es w re keine gute idee in einer stadt wie hollywood meine intelligenz zu verlieren
2685929 wir sind auf einem sehr guten weg entgegen vielen bef rchtungen anl sslich der erweiterung des schengen raumes
2685930 in allen bundesl ndern in fast allen landeshauptst dten und in den meisten grenzbezirken ist ein kriminalit tsr ckgang zu verzeichnen das bedeutet aber nicht dass wir uns auf diesen ergebnissen ausruhen sondern dass wir genau diesen weg fortsetzen wollen
2685931 nicht nur die polizei sondern alle verantwortungstr ger sind gefordert ihren teil beizutragen
2685932 entschuldigungen beim opfer wiedergutmachung von verursachten sch den oder gemeinn tzige arbeit sind f r mich vertretbar und ein wichtiger schritt um die grenze zwischen recht und unrecht deutlich zu machen
2685933 die netzwerke m ssen weiter verst rkt ausgebaut und verbessert werden
2685934 it takes a lot of concentration you cant brake too fast for example or the hook will start swinging and its tough to get it to stop and when its windy the most stressful time the guys might ask me to bring a load over a little bit but the wind blows into my boom and i have to be in third or fourth gear to get it over there i have to get it to go and stop go and stop to move it that little bit a crane operator depends upon their rigger to help guide the loads crane operators and riggers have their own special vocabulary they use as they communicate by radio the crane operator often cannot see what is going on as the rigger guides in the load its a lot like an airline pilot and an air traffic controller its all about getting the cargo in safely shawn carlson describes his riggers job like this when he says to trolley down a dog he means a unit of measurement he wants the hoist lowered about 6 inches thats the dog he might say one dog two dogs three dogs one time he pulled out a chihuahua then it was a saint bernard one day a whisker and a hair are the same thing a blondie is a hair a hair also is about 6 inches a bump is a little more than a hair about a foot hell say 20 different words that mean the same thing sometimes hell use the actual footage too especially if im in a blind spot hell say come down 3 feet carlson is honest about the stress of the job it takes a lot of inner energy to make this equipment do what it needs to do the first three weeks i was up here i had to go home every night have a coke and just watch tv for a while like my dad used to do when i was a kid i couldnt figure out why hed always come home and take a nap but you have to unwind it gets pretty stressful sometimes
2685935 a lot of older operators dont always like it when i tell them they have to do things a certain way even though theyve done it the same way for 30 years
2685936 some of that is because im a woman some of it is because im young and they dont always think i know what im talking about then i start quoting the code and the law and they get it
2685937 when a crane is on the job often there is a lets just get it done attitude this can be dangerous
2685938 were going to approach this faa reauthorization to try to direct attention to some of the issues we read about every day 3 000 flights being canceled airlines flying with improper equipment
2685939 it makes no sense that consolidation is limited to domestic partners
2685940 carriers have no authority or legal property interest in the slots
2685941 attempt to take away that property would require due process and just compensation
2685942 if consumers start to push back the airlines will be smart and continue to lean as much as possible on the business traveler side
2685943 if fuel prices remain as is the financial impact on the airline industry is expected to rival that of 9 11
2685944 increasingly passengers are certain that the airlines are not on their side and actually dont care anything about them
2685945 passenger satisfaction is dismal and things probably wont get any better if airlines continue to charge more for less
2685946 because it was a grim possibility it takes us all by surprise
2685947 the employees arent going to go back and gut the contract again that was a one time deal
2685948 is bankruptcy inevitable no but you cant ignore the fact that american has some significant obligations coming due that cant be ignored
2685949 we wanted to preserve jobs keep our work in house and protect retirement and healthcare
2685950 so we were looking to make adjustments anywhere else we could
2685951 when you look at the industry and our competitors and where our employees stand theyre in a much better position than their counterparts
2685952 amr is the only carrier at this point that may need to renegotiate its loan covenants this year a step already taken by ual and northwest
2685953 in addition americans labor costs are the highest in the industry
2685954 the recommendation from international was to let the members decide because of the uncertainty of the industry
2685955 the airline industry as it is constituted today was not built to withstand oil prices at 125 a barrel and certainly not when record fuel expenses are coupled with a weak u s economy
2685956 our company and industry simply cannot afford to sit by hoping for industry and market conditions to improve
2685957 must find ways to cover the cost of providing our services so that we can remain viable and have the resources to reinvest in our company for the future
2685958 as well as create a more sustainable supply and demand balance
2685959 the bottom line is that our revenues which include ticket sales and fees must keep pace with our increasing costs
2685960 would be placed at risk in a merger with another carrier in todays environment
2685961 it was horrible it was unexpected it was really without warning
2685962 in order to start los angeles service without losing money we would have had to raise the fares beyond what we believe customers would have been willing to pay
2685963 this amendment gives us the flexibility to implement the significant actions we are taking to combat higher fuel costs including reducing capacity creating new streams of revenue and lowering our costs
2685964 the united guys are very much heading in the direction of something that will really allow them to downsize the airline
2685965 there is no large financial benefit that we are not receiving because we dont have one integrated pilot contract right now or one seniority list
2685966 were optimistic that economic conditions will be on the upswing in 2010 giving us a better chance of success with our first route to china
2685967 every u s carrier including continental is under enormous pressure from record high fuel prices a slowing u s economy and a weak dollar
2685968 it is what liberalization was intended to do i think it is inevitable that the increase in the number of players will see a downward pressure on fares
2685969 our strategy is to identify the highest risk products and then insist that everything is certified by someone we trust
2685970 its time for president bush to nominate an administrator who solves transportation problems rather than creating more of them
2685971 instead we got the same old stale proposals the same neglect of our nations infrastructure needs
2685972 i doubt that theres an airport operator or airport executive in the country that would agree with that
2685973 it is pretty hard to believe the administration is serious about increasing capacity when they again cut airport improvement program funding by nearly 22 percent
2685974 once again the bush administration wants huge new taxes and user fees imposed on general aviation and it wants to slash and burn the airport improvement program
2685975 has made coming to work optional for too many employees
2685976 the slower growth for passenger demand in december sets the trend for the coming months
2685977 people traveling on our flights have said it is important that they keep in touch with the office friends and family
2685978 we work with the authorities and we have the highest levels of security and respect them
2685979 i do like being able to go to the front of the line
2685980 other airlines seem to be ceaselessly trying to part money from me without providing service
2685981 of our entire february schedule we will cancel one tenth of 1 percent of the entire schedule
2685982 we are pleased that the apa today responded to americans previous requests for a protocol agreement
2685983 in binding arbitration you are placing your fate completely in the hands of a third party
2685984 we want to ensure that we have the time to be thoughtful and deliberate about the issues
2685985 americans history as far as mergers and acquisitions are concerned is not a good one
2685986 american airlines after investigation has determined that oxygen was administered on the aircraft and it was working and the defibrillator was applied as well
2685987 its been five years since we made those significant concessions and the cost of living has gone up
2685988 we can recover all those things and make significant gains
2685989 when compared to peers are very strong and reflect the success of our restructuring
2685990 would not move forward with any transaction that did not serve the interests of our employees our shareholders our customers and the communities we serve
2685991 i have to question the sanity of any airline where if you have a problem you cant call them
2685992 we have changed and the environment we are in has changed
2685993 we believe calmer labor relations remove a headwind on uals potential involvement in industry consolidation
2685994 the pilots at united are done doing anything that is at their discretion sorry but look for the bare minimum from the employees at united airlines until further notice
2685995 but i hear the pilots calm voice telling atc that were experiencing continuous light chop and i can relax more
2685996 the last link with a world i enjoyed very much
2685997 united airlines will not merge with another carrier unless we say it will merge
2685998 the only way they pay attention is if were acting up
2685999 acting up can mean any number of things and thats as far as im going to go
2686000 when you cant rely as much on market stimulation and have to steal share from other airlines you have to be relevant to business travelers
2686001 were also seeing a greater number of customers are waiting for sale fares than observed in the past
2686002 we dont see any signs of corporate travel fading away suddenly there is still business going on around the world
2686003 consumers are already shell shocked by higher prices but their wallets are going to be hit harder than ever before on their next vacation or business trip
2686004 instead of requesting meetings in hawaii and other faraway places my clients are booking meetings where their employees can arrive by car or train
2686005 rule 240 originally stated that in the event of a cancellation or flight misconnection the airline would have to put you on their next flight out or if that wasnt
2686006 in many ways weve seen the enemy and it is us
2686007 were not willing to pay for better services yet we fully expect them
2686008 they cant raise fares because they have no pricing control
2686009 its not that they dont have the courage it would be business suicide to fall out of lockstep
2686010 the three biggest enemies to airlines today are fuel costs the internet and southwest a smart lean mean flying machine
2686011 one thing worse than high fares is no fares because youve lost airline service
2686012 its an effort to circumvent the airlines unilateral implementation of the furlough policy and avoid the disciplining of pilots who refuse to work overtime
2686013 continental continues to invest in its product to make flying more comfortable for our global customers
2686014 the airline industrys ability to find new sources of equity never ceases to amaze me
2686015 it put some incentive back in for those who wanted to fly more
2686016 this would burden the pbgc with more than 15 6 billion in additional liabilities on top of its 13 1 billion deficit for fiscal year 2007
2686017 it is absolutely irresponsible for alpa to promote unlawful behavior particularly in this environment when the industry is taking unprecedented actions to offset record fuel prices
2686018 draconian contract and work rules negotiated under the duress of bankruptcy
2686019 yesterday united management launched a very serious attack on employees by issuing an inaccurate and misleading media statement concerning the pilots at united airlines
2686020 the work of alpa and a small group of pilots
2686021 alpas communications are essentially a guide describing how to use sick leave inappropriately
2686022 despite these significant steps unlawful job actions escalated intimidation of pilots continued and the impact on our customers and other employees grew to truly unacceptable levels
2686023 alpas communications are essentially a guide describing how to use sick leave inappropriately
2686024 with close to 1 7 million loyal guests served seven destination cities and a list of travel industry best in class awards we couldnt be more pleased to celebrate
2686025 the collapse of both aloha and ata occurred in the first week of the quarter so our financial results reflect the amalgam of increased revenue from carrying 21 percent more customers hawaiian airlines
2686026 while we see skywest as one of the higher quality providers of regional capacity we see little growth in the industry right now given difficulties major airlines are facing
2686027 september is coming and thats when a sharp decline will happen
2686028 we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and the business continues to be strongly cash generative with over 2
2686029 we will dump the price to wherever it needs to be in order to get to 80
2686030 if passengers are booking ahead of the 80 seat target we will close off the cheap seats
2686031 the are all basically saying the same thing and its going to be a logical progression
2686032 this industry has never seen the stresses like its seeing right now or like its going into its seen some shocks before but never anything like this and its going to be messy
2686033 we will see a number of failures as there are quite a lot of weak carriers that will not survive we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
2686034 if we make a profit we stay if were making a loss and we cant see how well ever make a profit then we leave
2686035 the cost characteristics of the industry appear to make it difficult for firms to rapidly contract in the face of declining demand
2686036 it seems like perception is what trumps reality with respect to stock price and call it overall financial strength
2686037 with air travel demand softening around the world we expect the lack of pricing power will continue leading to further erosion of profit as costs rise
2686038 in the last 10 years this steady growth has been interrupted twice first by the meltdown of the global economy in 2001 following the burst of the internet bubble which was compounded by a year of crises with the traumatic events of 9 11 the gulf war and the sars epidemic within asia
2686039 and second on the immediate horizon by the extraordinary impact that the rising cost of oil is having on the global economy
2686040 theres always that possibility im sure theres a lot of sweating
2686041 hedging gives you the ability to fix costs and or profit margins but it typically takes away potential for windfall profits for favourable price movements
2686042 airlines are not traders they are not in the business of buying and selling they go into the market to protect price levels on fuel purchases and these are strategic decisions
2686043 the reserve was not created to alleviate a commercial industrys burden but to ensure that the people who need it most will have the ability to heat their homes
2686044 the airline industry enables global commerce so i have to believe at some point these companies can become global like the companies they serve
2686045 the u s economy cant afford to have one of its major airlines just shut down for days
2686046 planes are full and with any little thing that happens people cant get somewhere
2686047 people dont have to pay for services they dont want
2686048 has a real geographic niche and it knows how to play the field
2686049 quite a few airlines have recognized that theres value in aligning long haul international routes with carriers that are pre eminent in their markets
2686050 but north south is a problem and the incursion of other carriers is problematic in the near term
2686051 the first thing they wanted to do is take away the retiree medical
2686052 it could be that individual unions are losing their bargaining power
2686053 our members are feeling the brunt of the bad economy too
2686054 is the largest of the legacy airlines and will be standing when the crisis is over and the weak carriers have disappeared
2686055 the government will never permit a company the size of american to go on strike
2686056 would take corporate customers the people you really want to carry from american
2686057 has unhappy employees heavy debt and higher labor costs than most of its major competitors
2686058 the information is presented in one place at one time and it is updated dynamically
2686059 this tells us the actual status of the plane passengers and service
2686060 it helps us decide things like the order in which flights are brought back to dallas and priorities in terms of international flights and crew legalities
2686061 we restructured the company the right way weve paid our debt funded our pension plans funded obligation to creditors our employees are highest paid in the industry and our equity didnt become worthless thats what we are paid to do
2686062 however the landscape is changing we will review our strategic alternatives and make sure we remain a strong long term competitor
2686063 on long overseas flights because of its limited range even with full fuel tanks
2686064 will keep quite a few of the northwest operating people
2686065 to be a bit more careful and opportunistic about where we add our capacity
2686066 while we need to reduce costs in this difficult environment we will not be going back to our employees for pay cuts
2686067 skybus struggled to overcome the combination of rising jet fuel costs and a slowing economic environment
2686068 i have been subjected to reprisal by management and harassment by co workers
2686069 the message i have been getting is not to rock the boat
2686070 i believe there was a failure on the part of the leadership in the southwest region
2686071 if consolidation takes root either through mergers or outright capacity reductions convincing many that the overall industry is improving we expect interest in southwest from investors that do not traditionally traffic in the airline space
2686072 it has become more reliant on incremental revenue generating opportunities which could be more difficult to achieve in an economic downturn
2686073 weve slowed our growth rate in less than 12 months from 8 to what will probably be 2 in 2009
2686074 the potential for revenue lost due to no shows could easily undermine southwests low fare leadership
2686075 right now the conversation more appropriately seems to be between boeing and the federal aviation administration rather than us but nonetheless we erred on the side of safety
2686076 in 2007 boeing changed that apparently at the request of one customer that it be inspected but they say its voluntary so we found ourselves in a bit of a peculiar situation as to whether or not to submit to the faa that we think we should be inspected
2686077 our objective is to have a clear line of sight to the performance of each business unit
2686078 divesting assets that do not earn an acceptable rate of return is just as important to us as investing only where we can earn sufficient profit
2686079 united will not be taking delivery of new aircraft until we need them
2686080 our primary responsibility is the safety of our customers and our employees and there is no obligation we take more seriously
2686081 we are using our flexibility to respond quickly and decisively to todays marketplace and to manage successfully through this challenging economic cycle
2686082 consolidation will help get the industry closer to being able to compete against foreign carriers
2686083 the industry has changed dramatically both globally and domestically and the old paradigms no longer apply the current fuel and economic environment are only accelerating the need for a different approach
2686084 the path to sustainable profitability requires us to fundamentally overhaul every facet of our business
2686085 people tend to believe that theres no real value in acquiring or merging with us airways because it doesnt have any list of unique international destinations that they could tack onto their network
2686086 i see them us airways as being the least attractive partner
2686087 its my view that us airways is the least attractive of the merger candidates
2686088 virgin america also a private company may be the next casualty
2686089 i can finally fly all the way around the world on a virgin plane
2686090 it is regretful that the air line pilots association alpa is again trying to hype the media with the threat of a strike as a negotiations ploy
2686091 foreign carriers are merging to grow larger and financially stronger and u s carriers have to match that to remain competitive
2686092 zoroaster established a criterion other than usefulness to determine whether a power was good or bad by making an ethical distinction between the spirits
2686093 spirit only and withal the spirit of truth purity and justice
2686094 among the beings opposed to ormuzd a conspicuous place is taken by the dragon azhi dahaka whose home is in bapel babylon a druj half human half beast with three heads this dragon creates drouth and disease
2686095 ignorant folk at the beginning of an eclipse throw themselves on their knees and beat gongs and drums to frighten away the hungry devil
2686096 having on one occasion failed to do so and having received a reprimand he proceeded with the prayer that he might become a destructive dragon
2686097 fiendish snake three jawed and triple headed six eyed of thousand powers and of mighty strength a lie demon of the daevas evil for our settlements and wicked whom the evil spirit angra mainyu made
2686098 he appears still in that character in yasti xix seq where he is described struggling against atar fire in the sea vourukasha his contest with yima khshaeta bore at first the same mythological character the shining yima being originally like the vedic yima a solar hero when yima was turned into an earthly king azhi underwent the same fate
2686099 fire is everywhere the deadly foe of these fiendish serpents which are water spirits they are ever powerless against the sun as was azhi lacking wit against ormuzd
2686100 tradition adds another guardian to the precious deposit a dragon or winged serpent this sits forever brooding over the treasures which it cannot enjoy greedy of gold like those famous griffins that contended with the ancient arimaspians
2686101 it was eighty yards in length and so fierce that neither elephant nor demon nor lion ever ventured to pass by its lair
2686102 almost tore up the earth with its heels to rouse his sleeping master
2686103 will be compared to each other along with those of the mummy of king tutankhamun
2686104 governments have got to be embarrassed into addressing the issue this is a scandal and its got to be tackled
2686105 the government encourages irrational pricing so people can fly but quite frankly not everyone should be able to afford to fly
2686106 its not good for customers for employees or for communities to have this volatility
2686107 to negotiate a eu wide comprehensive air services agreement with australia
2686108 give me back the meal take my luggage at no additional charge give me my window or aisle seat without an upcharge and increase the price of a ticket
2686109 people put up with poor service on southwest flights because they are cheap
2686110 raising prices is such a simplistic concept except for this every time it happens economy minded travelers head for southwest and other discounters
2686111 i would travel but i probably wouldnt take a second checked bag
2686112 i would try to carry on as much as i could
2686113 many travelers believe their time is not respected and it is leading them to avoid a significant number of trips
2686114 we all know people who say its a hassle its not worth it
2686115 if we increase fares in a not very good economic situation we will have a very strong impact on demand
2686116 its now a value proposition more than a price proposition
2686117 in this country we believe its written into the constitution that everyone can travel by air
2686118 consumers just wont go on vacation or will jump in a car and businesspeople will just have a phone conference instead demand is very sensitive in commercial airlines
2686119 it will probably be a more pleasant travel experience on the whole
2686120 the industry will have to behave differently in terms of customer service
2686121 elite fliers of the pre deregulation days wont be back and theres always going to be a deal out there somewhere but not for anyone who wants travel at peak times
2686122 as capacity cutbacks happen there will be fewer seats available and any people whose flights are delayed wont be moved through the system very quickly
2686123 consumers should be wary and be prepared for longer delays and the possibility of being stranded
2686124 it was surprising to learn that customers are less concerned about paying higher fees than about what they see as a decline in the quality of customer service customers are saying that if theyre treated badly by an airline theyll vote with their feet
2686125 in this unstable industry environment it is critical that airlines invest in their employees as a means to enhance the customer experience as there is a strong connection between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction
2686126 if you see a good price its where you want to go a price you can afford then dont wait around chances are there arent going to be many seats at that low price
2686127 half of us know where we want to be for thanksgiving yet most of us wait if you know right now book now
2686128 sit down put on your seat belt and shut up
2686129 on an american carrier you are so afraid to ask for something extra
2686130 routes we might have gone into in a 50 or 60 per barrel of oil environment dont hold up at 100
2686131 flies under the price umbrella of delta with a lower cost structure
2686132 weve made a decision to basically stop all growth for this year and well into next
2686133 theyve put a strong emphasis on people and processes and it shows
2686134 reduce capacity in an effort to significantly reduce costs and create a more sustainable supply and demand balance in the market
2686135 our pilot cost per block hour which is already the industrys highest would increase more than 150 percent placing aa at a crippling disadvantage compared to our competitors
2686136 however any changes that benefit our pilots must be linked to increases in efficiency and productivity so that we can strengthen our company and be better equipped to compete and succeed in our rapidly changing industry
2686137 in these mediated negotiations it is critical that we engage in a process that produces economically viable proposals and stimulates honest conversations
2686138 while the reductions will vary by department they will generally be in line with the capacity reduction of approximately 8 percent from the 2008 plan
2686139 these are for senior pilots who already are eligible to retire
2686140 it is a way for them to retire a little earlier than they might have otherwise with a little extra cash
2686141 one of the lowest cost structures in the industry and strongest balance sheets in the industry
2686142 while its important to maintain a broad domestic presence for our customers and employees as well as to feed international routes we remain flexible and will make additional adjustments if needed
2686143 to an emphasis on margin and ebitdar by pruning slowly developing new markets and raising fares more aggressively than the market
2686144 to make sure we have the cash level necessary to operate
2686145 in the current environment capacity has to come out of the industry
2686146 that comes from retiring planes in the fleet and not taking delivery of new planes
2686147 achieving a joint contract and combined seniority list in advance of the closing of the merger is something that has never been done in this industry
2686148 we cant become addicted to this cost advantage that weve built up
2686149 we need to continue to manage other costs the way we always have
2686150 at this time we are not thinking seriously about an acquisition
2686151 our goal is to make a 15 annual return on invested capital each year
2686152 we have a wonderful advantage where fees dont fly with southwest
2686153 to say i am disappointed would be an understatement we are devastated
2686154 likely to be significantly higher six to 12 months from now
2686155 a significant step leading to a more effective and efficient operating fleet for united in the years ahead while improving our customer experience and reliability
2686156 the magnitude of the challenge the industry faces demands unprecedented change
2686157 were confident united has the ability and resources to go it alone
2686158 frequency reductions while retaining a commitment to all five u s hubs
2686159 all told we expect that merchandising opportunities will generate 1 billion in revenue annually over the next few years
2686160 we need to pull every lever that is available to us be it capacity discipline fare increases fuel surcharges ancillary revenue generation or something as basic as returning pricing segmentation to the marketplace
2686161 with record breaking fuel prices we must pursue new revenue opportunities while continuing to offer competitive fares by tailoring our products and services around what our customers value most and are willing to pay for
2686162 wow what a difference a half a billion dollars makes
2686163 youre only here for a short visit dont hurry dont worry and be sure to smell the flowers along the way
2686164 cease your caresses unless you are ready to give me a proof that you do really and sincerely love me
2686165 give over cobbling it is a vile low trade and never yields more than ten or twelve dinars a day turn astrologer your fortune will be made and i shall have all i wish and be happy
2686166 all i know is that if you do not turn astrologer immediately i will be divorced from you to morrow
2686167 i am an astrologer i know the sun and the moon and the stars and the twelve signs of the zodiac i can calculate nativities i can foretell everything that is to happen
2686168 if you understand your art you must be able to discover the kings ruby do so and i will give you two hundred pieces of gold but if you do not succeed within six hours i will use all my influence at court to have you put to death as an impostor
2686169 o woman woman thou art more baneful to the happiness of man than the poisonous dragon of the desert
2686170 you are discovered my dear mistress you are discovered by a vile astrologer before six hours are past the whole story will be known and you will become infamous if you are even so fortunate as to escape with life unless you can find some way of prevailing on him to be merciful
2686171 spare my honour and my life and i will confess everything
2686172 oh nothing nothing with which you are not already acquainted you know too well that i stole the ruby from the kings crown i did so to punish my husband who uses me most cruelly and i thought by this means to obtain riches for myself and to have him put to death but you most wonderful man from whom nothing is hidden have discovered and defeated my wicked plan i beg only for mercy and will do whatever you command me
2686173 woman i know all thou hast done and it is fortunate for thee that thou hast come to confess thy sin and beg for mercy before it was too late return to thy house put the ruby under the pillow of the couch on which thy husband sleeps let it be laid on the side furthest from the door and be satisfied thy guilt shall never be even suspected
2686174 courage my dearest husband this is only your first labour in your new and noble profession go on and prosper and we shall become rich and happy
2686175 i am an astrologer i know the sun and the moon and the stars and the twelve signs of the zodiac i can calculate nativities i can foretell everything that is to happen
2686176 a man of your knowledge and penetration will easily discover my jewels find them and i will give you fifty pieces of gold
2686177 stay here a few moments thou great astrologer i will return immediately with the reward thou so well deservest
2686178 thou wonderful man to whom all the secrets of nature are revealed i had quite forgotten where i laid the jewels and without thee should never have found them but when thou desiredst me to look at the rent below i instantly recollected the rent near the bottom of the wall in the bathroom where before undressing i had hid them i can now go home in peace and comfort and it is all owing to thee thou wisest of men
2686179 i am going to my death the kings astrologer has heard of my presumption and is determined to have me executed as an impostor
2686180 the ways of heaven most learned and excellent ahmed are unsearchable the high are often cast down and the low are lifted up the whole world depends upon fate and fortune it is my turn now to be depressed by fate it is thine to be exalted by fortune
2686181 but who were they and what have they done with my gold and jewels
2686182 i cannot now answer but i hope to satisfy your majesty if you will grant me forty days to make my calculations
2686183 but when they are past if my treasure is not found your life shall pay the forfeit
2686184 except that i am to be put to death at the end of forty days unless i find forty chests of gold and jewels which have been stolen from the royal treasury
2686185 by the same art which discovered the ruby and the ladys necklace
2686186 foolish woman thou knowest that i have no art and that i have only pretended to it for the sake of pleasing thee but i have had sufficient skill to gain forty days during which time we may easily escape to some other city and with the money i now possess and the aid of my former occupation we may still obtain an honest livelihood
2686187 will thy cobbling thou mean spiritless wretch ever enable me to go to the hemm m like the wife of the chief astrologer i hear me ahmed think only of discovering the kings treasure thou hast just as good a chance of doing so as thou hadst of finding the ruby and the necklace and earrings at all events i am determined thou shalt not escape and shouldst thou attempt to run away i will inform the kings officers and have thee taken up and put to death even before the forty days are expired thou knowest me too well ahmed to doubt my keeping my word so take courage and endeavour to make thy fortune and to place me in that rank of life to which my beauty entitles me
2686188 your will shall be obeyed all i desire is to pass the few remaining days of my life as comfortably as i can you know i am no scholar and have little skill in reckoning so there are forty dates give me one of them every night after i have said my prayers that i may put them in a jar and by counting them may always see how many of the few days i have to live are gone
2686189 we are all found out ahmed the new astrologer has told the king that there are forty of us
2686190 this ahmed with all his simple good nature is a shrewd fellow forty chests having been stolen he naturally guessed that there must be forty thieves and he has made a good hit that is all still it is prudent to watch him for he certainly has made some strange discoveries one of us must go to night after dark to the terrace of this cobblers house and listen to his conversation with his handsome wife for he is said to be very fond of her and will no doubt tell her what success he has had in his endeavours to detect us
2686191 my dear wife to night there are two of them
2686192 the number is complete to night the whole forty are here
2686193 have patience i know what you are come for it is a very unjust and wicked deed
2686194 we are fully convinced that thou knowest why we are come nor do we mean to justify the action of which thou speakest here are two thousand pieces of gold which we will give thee provided thou wilt swear to say nothing more about the matter
2686195 do you think it possible i can suffer such gross wrong and injustice without complaining and making it known to all the world
2686196 only spare our lives and we will restore the royal treasure
2686197 guilty men ye are persuaded that ye cannot escape from my penetration which reaches unto the sun and moon and knows the position and aspect of every star in the heavens your timely repentance has saved you but ye must immediately restore all that ye have stolen go straightway and carry the forty chests exactly as ye found them and bury them a foot deep under the southern wall of the old ruined hemm m beyond the kings palace if ye do this punctually your lives are spared but if ye fail in the slightest degree destruction will fall upon you and your families
2686198 ahmed thy looks are promising hast thou discovered my treasure
2686199 does your majesty require the thieves or the treasure the stars will only grant one or the other
2686200 your majesty must make your choice i can deliver up either but not both
2686201 but if it must be so i choose the treasure
2686202 and you give the thieves a full and free pardon
2686203 if your majesty will follow me the treasure shall be restored to you
2686204 without a confirmed faa administrator safety and modernization projects will be left to the whims of a rudderless federal bureaucracy it is beyond me why anyone in the senate would want to hold up filling this vital leadership role
2686205 this is a business world where corporations have to boost profits
2686206 what we dont want is an unregulated monopoly on a regional basis
2686207 ba and virgin are very much at the top end of the market the americans are at the low end and that is the way they are perceived by customers
2686208 parents want their children to experience a different culture and learn first hand what the world is like
2686209 unfortunately for travelers in 2008 this increasewill probably be the first in a continued wave of increases
2686210 its frustrating to report a fourth quarter adjusted loss in what has been a solid year relative to other carriers
2686211 we need a union president who is willing and has the ability to take on american executives when necessary and fight for the flight attendants who are out there on the planes every day
2686212 things are going to be very different the whole tone is going to change particularly with contract negotiations and its going to be more intense
2686213 its obvious that the membership wants the return of our previous salaries and then some
2686214 flight attendants are broke and tired and hungry and angry and just despondent
2686215 we need someone who will unify us and fight for us
2686216 our positive earnings and cash flow allowed us to pay down a significant amount of debt
2686217 the outstanding performance of our team has once again set us apart from the competition
2686218 delta has comfort with northwest and a transaction with northwest would be easier to do
2686219 a deal with united could be both riskier but a more exciting transaction the atlanta based unit of the air line pilots association opened its strike operations center and mobilized its tactical arm the strike preparedness committee pinnacle this summer will replace atlantic southeast airlines as the delta connection carrier operating the atlanta cozumel route delta dal was considering a merger with northwest nwa or united uaua delta plans to cancel the equivalent of 10 domestic mainline aircraft and 35 regional jets by grounding planes and using them less this year delta has taken on two more boeing 757s bringing its fleet total to 15 aircraft the aircraft which came from american airlines fleet delta and united united is a larger carrier and arguably the better known brand northwest is smaller than delta so its more likely that delta would be the surviving brand and the headquarters would stay in atlanta air franceklm also could provide strategic or financial backing in a delta bid for northwest if delta were to strike a deal with united and defect from skyteam the move would be a double blow to air franceklm delta exited first in april 2007 its shares have dropped 34 since and carry a fpe ratio of 14 4 the carrier sees negative operating margins in the first quarter the company took 13 domestic aircraft out of its fleet in the fourth quarter and this month plans to cancel the equivalent of another 10 domestic mainline aircraft delta sees a first quarter operating margin of negative 2 to 4 with domestic mainline capacity falling 3 to 4 in the quarter frontier frontier airlines has developed a strong brand frontier has made some big moves in recent weeks including layoffs and a realignment of its route network the company is considering partnering with international airlines and u s low cost carriers shedding some planes further tweaking its route network and possibly shifting to a pricing structure in which passengers pay extra for some services and amenities efforts to revive frontier financially for me the biggest priorities are focusing on the bottom line and on profitability we have to stabilize the airline
2686220 the rise in fuel costs forced frontier which hasnt posted an annual profit in nearly four years
2686221 i think we needed to narrow down the priorities when you have 100 different things going on its hard to do them well
2686222 for us to compete we either have to go out and buy a bunch of new airplanes or we can develop relationships that will deliver that in a different way
2686223 its becoming more important now to determine how we get more money out of the product were offering
2686224 he will have to decide whether he wants a warm and fuzzy company or a lean and mean company that can survive in hard times
2686225 im a true believer in the culture here but theres a question in the marketplace of the longevity of this company
2686226 i want people to have jobs but if we dont make these tough decisions then we dont have a company
2686227 neither really has much choice but to roll back later today in order to stay competitive
2686228 southwest airlines is concerned about slowing economic growth and we want our flight schedule to be built around flights that are in high demand
2686229 more use of off peak times will make for a more efficient operation
2686230 united may blame this weeks flight cancellations on poor weather in the midwest
2686231 but as most of our competitors demonstrated the real culprit was uniteds lack of manpower
2686232 we worked late into the evenings both days to get customers to their destinations
2686233 when you extend the amount of time we had people working those days we knew wed have to cancel flights the subsequent days
2686234 management team that is bent on personal profit over customer service
2686235 uniteds pilots pin delays on top bosses union advertises take on latest trouble
2686236 it was a tough winter weather month for all the industry
2686237 this was the worst december in history weather wise for united
2686238 it was a tough winter weather month for all the industry
2686239 we believe ual remains as highly leveraged as ever to even the slightest fluctuations in demand for air travel
2686240 somewhere in the process the industry has lost sight of the fact that marginal costs dont stay marginal and marginal revenues can be destructive to core revenue performance
2686241 earlier this year we knew we had to reverse the domestic drag
2686242 driven by our continued discipline in managing capacity aggressively controlling inventory to improve revenue results we delivered industry leading passenger revenue performance
2686243 our position has always been that we control our decisions no one makes them for us
2686244 the advantage of our situation is that we have the choices that we continue to consider with our board
2686245 a consolidated u s carrier would be better able to compete in the international market
2686246 wed like to transparently present to the market its true value
2686247 we have none on order but thats something were looking at
2686248 should further adjustments be required you know that we will act decisively
2686249 a consolidated u s carrier would be far better prepared to compete in that environment
2686250 you can assume that absolutely everything goes into the mix of consideration
2686251 we have none on order but thats something were looking at
2686252 i think the thing that stands out the most is the amazing prasm passenger revenue per available seat mile increase
2686253 they looked like they were in a little bit stronger position than we though they would be
2686254 being the sixth of the big six were not going to be somebodys first choice
2686255 us airways is probably at some risk of being marginalized
2686256 us airways could also join the crowd and seek to acquire northwest
2686257 we have been and continue to be focused on single contracts for all of our represented labor groups and will continue to negotiate in the proper forums with them to that end
2686258 virgin atlantic is committed to resolving this dispute but the only way our cabin crew are going to see any form of pay increase in future is by joining the hundreds of volunteers coming in to work on the planned strike days and ensuring that our customers get to their destinations
2686259 i believe that the union are hearing loud and clear from their members that they will be far worse off unless they come in to work
2686260 for some of you more pay than virgin atlantic can afford may be critical to your lifestyle and if that is the case you should consider working elsewhere
2686261 they are trying to play catch up the americans have never been able to match us on innovation and new products it will be many many years before they catch up
2686262 it is absolutely the wrong time for the company to continue ramping up the branded flying strategy
2686263 we do not have the ability to handle the increased demand for air travel
2686264 one can imagine that this will extend and will become the rule everywhere everything will be more consistent
2686265 if people have bad experiences they may not travel again
2686266 the family going on vacation who now has to pay an extra 200 probably will think twice
2686267 people also want to know everything about that trip how do i get there is my flight on time what about my frequent flier miles
2686268 the pricing by mesa made it impossible to be profitable and under those circumstances no one would provide additional funding
2686269 it will be very difficult to maintain three interisland carriers
2686270 on a route of 750 miles the super 80s fuel cost per seat mile is 37 percent less than that of a 727 100 while its cockpit crew cost per seat mile is 42 percent less
2686271 that presupposes that boeing has the ability to give them 30 airplanes a year for the next 10 years
2686272 if were talking about an airplane that will have 12 percent specific fuel consumption improvement and being delivered in 2016 or 2017 ill continue with my 737 800s and replace the md 80s with them in a more aggressive manner
2686273 then you would say lets wait to that time frame to get that 35 percent improvement in fuel consumption
2686274 if we were to phase it out in the most rapid manner it would be eight years at least
2686275 continental remains firmly convinced that neither it nor its employees were the cause of the concorde tragedy and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously against any criminal charges
2686276 we can absorb these extraordinary high fuel prices for a little while
2686277 our plan is to fly where other competitors arent flying
2686278 it is not out of the question for delta to be profitable this year albeit modestly profitable
2686279 the only thing that changes is this time the flight attendants get to determine the issues and policies that affect them as a group instead of being dependent on the company to make decisions for them
2686280 airfares have to go up and our passengers will need to pay more airlines simply cannot absorb these cost increases
2686281 first we have to tighten our belt we need to find ways to preserve cash by reducing capital expenditures and operating costs
2686282 northwest is an attractive target for a number of airlines delta probably would have been the best fit
2686283 our stock has declined precipitously and as we share this bleaker outlook we anticipate at least 1 7 billion in higher fuel costs
2686284 is the best positioned of the network carriers to prosper in a standalone world
2686285 despite northwests solid financial performance it is still a relatively small player relative to american united and delta
2686286 immaterial relative to the companys earnings cash flow and liquidity
2686287 we see every airline except southwest posting a loss in 2008
2686288 we must be able to pass along these costs just like other businesses do
2686289 as the impact of todays business realities hits home the issue of sustainability should be front and center
2686290 we believe it to be in the best interest of us airways and all of our employees to focus on joint negotiations for a single labor agreement as we are now one company
2686291 america west pilots say their counterparts in the old us airways system are being promoted to captain at a much higher rate
2686292 the pilots i represent are angry frustrated and asking what was in this merger for us it appears as if the answer is nothing
2686293 they cant just get away with it bad service anymore
2686294 our fourth quarter earnings outlook has been impacted by higher than anticipated fuel prices and a weak u
2686295 fedex faces a challenging economic environment that includes persistently high oil prices sluggish u s growth and continued concerns in the credit markets
2686296 porter is probably the most exciting venture ive ever been a part of
2686297 i hate my life please help me i am going crazy right now
2686298 we got her away from him before it got worse
2686299 shell live with this for the rest of her life but we got her away from him
2686300 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2686301 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury

2686304 id say that is because the sky is clearer and lights in the sky are easier to see the sunshine coast also has a little bit of activity
2686305 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2686306 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2686307 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2686308 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2686309 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

2686316 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2686317 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2686318 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2686319 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2686320 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2686321 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2686322 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2686323 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2686324 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2686325 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2686326 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2686327 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2686342 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2686343 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2686344 he was here thats for sure i like his hair its like mine in the seventies but i cant tell you any more than that
2686345 id like to think that once the coloccini deal is completed then two more players will arrive and then well see what happens
2686346 i think therell be a lot of comings and goings late on as clubs try to re balance and somebody will come available who will be of interest
2686347 apple pulled the app july 31 without giving my any notification that they were doing it or what their justification was for removing it ive tried to contact them about the issue but its been a complete dead end

2686374 real madrid are ready to hit cristiano ronaldo with a 17million compensation claim for refusing to join them the spanish club are claiming that ronaldos agent jorge mendes struck the astonishing deal with them at the start of the summer transfer saga real are adamant they agreed personal terms with the manchester united star and insisted on the compensation clause if the transfer was not completed spanish media sources who have become madrids unofficial mouthpiece during the ronaldo negotiations are reporting that real president ramon calderon is determined to press ahead with the claim
2686375 manchester united will launch an astonishing 20million bid to land thierry henry before next weekends premier league curtain raiser against newcastle united sir alex ferguson whose team warm up against fa cup winners portsmouth in the fa community shield today has made the ex arsenal hitman his top priority following the breakdown of uniteds attempt to sign dimitar berbatov from tottenham appropriately if a deal goes through this week henry could make his united debut against newcastle on his 31st birthday next sunday
2686376 kaka believes that a world record transfer to chelsea remains a strong possibility and that he could be a premier league player before the end of this month chelsea have made a 100m 78m offer for the brazilian forward who would be prepared to move to london if his club milan accept it even though the world footballer of the year has not requested a transfer from milan and is contracted to the club until 2012 he has been unsettled by their handling of him in recent months the 26 year old was prevented from representing brazil at the olympics in beijing despite his club allowing summer signing ronaldinho to play and last week the clubs doctor questioned kak s decision to undergo close season knee surgery
2686377 liverpools american owners will attempt to win back rafa benitezs trust with an 18million bid for valencia winger david silva kop boss benitez is furious after the collapse of the gareth barry deal left him looking foolish now owners tom hicks and george gillett know they have to do something quickly to appease the spaniard they blocked a move for barry because they considered aston villas 18m valuation excessive they want to resurrect a bid for silva a hero of spains euro 2008 win and an anfield target earlier this summer
2686378 although portsmouth manager harry redknapp is bemoaning the lack of funds available to him one of the more intriguing aspects of the afternoon will be seeing jermain defoe and peter crouch in tandem for the cup holders in a classic little and large combination
2686379 with world cup qualifiers against andorra and croatia coming on sept 6 and 10 having the undivided attention of capello for 90 minutes today is a real opportunity for players who desperately want to be involved in the italians regeneration of the national side
2686380 campbell has always been a reluctant talker but when he can be prised out of his shell it is usually worth the effort and so it proved after training on friday when he held forth on all manner of subjects from knife crime to the football associations respect initiative designed to improve players behaviour towards match officials and his ambition to go to a fourth world cup with england and to win it this time
2686381 the administrators of the game have become besotted with their brand deluded into thinking that foreigners believe our premier league teams are as attractive and compelling as they think themselves to be and so another season is poised to start and we scrabble for interest wherever we can knowing that the top four will be the same top four as last year and that the bottom three will most likely be the three that came up or at best two of the three that came up
2686382 the premier league enters its 17th season off the back of arguably our most compelling competition yet the clubs put on a great show fantastic football in the finest set of club stadia in the world and the highest average top flight attendances in england for more than 50 years on top of that we had an all english champions league final for the first time testament to the strength of the premier league and the standards being set week in week out it is no accident that premier league clubs find themselves in this position financially strong and performing well on the pitch the collective selling of our media rights and the equitable distribution of broadcast revenue provides the stability to invest while rewarding success
2686383 for a start it is somewhat disingenuous to talk of virtuous circles when the premier league is by some distance the most linear competition in europe you cannot get a bet of 2 1 on either manchester united or chelsea to win the title yet hull city are available at 10 000 1 you might think that is normal and fair and you would be right hull have no chance of winning the title but neither have the weakest teams in serie a and la liga yet they are only priced at 1 000 1 the best price available on a bundesliga team is just 500 1 the ludicrous odds offered on the three newcomers to the premier league this season fully reflect the bookmakers conviction that no one outside the top four can possibly win the title and that even within the top four arsenal around 5 1 and liverpool around 7 1 can almost be regarded as rank outsiders everton for instance the team that finished fifth last season can be backed at 200 1 to win the title many people including the bookies fancy spurs to overtake them this season yet for all the comings and goings at white hart lane and the palpable sense of excitement that juande ramos has generated odds of 66 1 suggest no one expects a 47 year wait for a title to be over any time soon
2686384 under the respect scheme referees will speak to both captains before the game then ask them to help control their own players if disciplinary problems arise during it this can be viewed as a sort of safety valve or cooling off mechanism it emphasises the captains responsibility for putting his own house in order and stops the referee having to produce cards as a first recourse which can often inflame situations by making the contest unequal or leaving one side feeling persecuted that is basically all there is to it respect is simply an opportunity to remind players and officials that they need each other need to work together and have a greater responsibility to the overall good of the game
2686385 the so called respect agenda only football could appear unaware that the word
2686386 fergusons rabid determination to hold on to his teams main inspiration at a time when the glazers might have welcomed a 70m windfall was not just born out of a refusal to be bullied by real madrid it was because the scot knows ronaldo will be the key to achieving the unparalleled feat of an english team retaining both the league title and champions league and if united pull it off ferguson can wave a happy goodbye to cristiano and a tearful one to football and no one who respects his magnificent achievements and abhors ronaldos loathesome antics will blame him
2686387 in many ways you can see united becoming tevezs team ronaldo likely wont be there beyond next summer none of the midfielders except for perhaps one day anderson seem to have the charisma age profile and durability to grow into a long term leadership role rooneys position on the pitch is evolving and changing and is sure to be the subject of further discussion sir alex indicated that maybe he was playing too far away from goal his scoring totals have declined every season after arriving at old trafford and yet his own future seems distinctly linked to tevez in fact you get the sense that going forward rooney may be shifted around to accommodate tevez as a partnership the two will most likely be integral to uniteds future more so than ronaldo and thats why the clubs foremost priority must be turning tevez contract which at present is a loan with two years remaining into a permanent deal figures of 30m have been mentioned if united can pull it off it could be their transfer coup of the summer more so than berbatov or even hanging on to ronaldo for another season
2686388 were luiz felipe scolari to be subject to the same financial constraints as jose mourinho during his last year the picture would be different but roman abramovich has apparently changed tack again and instead of steve sidwell from reading this summers addition to an already formidable midfield is the rather more impressive deco from barcelona the hiring of a proven world class coach as successor to avram grant appears to have persuaded frank lampard and didier drogba to stick around for another year and conse quently chelsea who during the champions league final in moscow looked as good a team as their rivals are capable of taking the title back from them with or without robinho
2686389 at chelsea because of abramovich and the building work still in progress scolari will have the opportunity to get everything as right as it can be and we assume an appreciation of the owners philosophy hence deco and a suspicion that artistry will be back in fashion at the bridge this season
2686390 chelsea are stronger for the arrival of scolari bosingwa and deco with robinho to come but united are reliant on the same personnel it could all change if they eventually manage to sign dimitar berbatov but as things stand the lovejoy beer money is on the boys in blue mind you it was last time
2686391 not for the first time in his liverpool career rafa benitez feels undermined embarrassed and isolated by his board his summer pursuit of gareth barry over benitez has two options he can accept the decision and use the 18million earmarked for the villa man to make an alternative target david silva the third most expensive player in liverpools history or as his latest cryptic press conference hinted he can end the uneasy truce since klinsmanngate made liverpool the grubbiest story in town and ensure the new campaign starts amid similar chaos so hurt is benitez by what he perceives as a challenge to his leadership even his hierarchy have no idea what hell do or say next
2686392 kick off was delayed in liverpools friendly versus lazio on friday because of pressure on anfields turnstiles supporters were drawn by the first home outing of a partnership that makes them think this time it will be different that between fernando torres and robbie keane there are other reasons for imagining liverpool are about to improve daniel agger is back from injury ryan babel who grew sharply in potency during his first season is a youngster ready to advance and andrea dossena benitezs new 7m left back looks capable of proving penetration on the flanks which was previously lacking
2686393 the likeliest survivor among the promoted clubs is tony mowbrays albion who possess a touch of class have bought astutely and place the accent on a passing game but which of the premier league householders may find themselves subject to repossession though newcastle and west ham look probable underachievers they boast sufficient quality blackburn probably do too though deprived of their merlin mark hughes they could well flirt with danger we all witnessed the kind of vacuum that canbe created when big sam allardyce vacated the reebok leaving little sammy lee
2686394 staying in the premiership is far more difficult than winning promotion realistically it requires several attempts during which so the theory runs a smart club fattens its bank balance in preparation for the next assault insane money makes such thoughts possible even if they do finish last hull can count on 32 million during the following two years parachute payments will add a further 30 million a sensible club could do a lot with such sums a sensible club and hull have no real choice can take relegation on the chin for that sort of money
2686395 last year the club had a fantastic start but unfortunately werent able to sustain it for whatever reason things that happened before i was on the radar were trying to make sure we have the range and depth of squad and levels of physical capacity to sustain a run at the competitions were in from start to finish if we can do that i fully expect us to be in the top 10 again at least
2686396 we made a very good offer for a top striker who we didnt get but it would certainly have smashed the transfer record at this football club so we are prepared to spend we are trying the figures dont scare me or worry me its when youre paying over the odds for average players you have to try to balance your books but trust me if liverpool win the league this year they wont be saying they paid over the odds for robbie keane
2686397 rio ferdinand seems to have nudged ahead of john terry in the running but the more i think about it the more i think capello was right in the first place just give it to the guy with the most caps

2686401 sometimes you never fully face up to things that you ought to face up to
2686402 tobacco addiction is just as powerful of an addiction as heroin or crack addiction
2686403 i did three events this week which were projected to raise 650 000 and actually raised 800 000 tipper and i were supposed to do 1 1 million and it looks like we will be closer to 1 3 million

2686406 the pacific yew can be cut down and processed to produce a potent chemical taxol which offers some promise of curing certain forms of lung breast and ovarian cancer in patients who would otherwise quickly die it seems an easy choice sacrifice the tree for a human life until one learns that three trees must be destroyed for each patient treated that only specimens more than a hundred years old contain the potent chemical in their bark and that there are very few of these yews remaining on earth

2686417 in the face of moderation of growth in the global economy if india has to sustain a high growth trajectory then quick development of the infrastructure sector is imperative
2686418 this would serve the twin objectives of keeping the demand high and with larger capacity creation would ensure that some of the supply side bottlenecks are taken care of
2686419 the planning commission had drawn up a detailed plan for investment of about 500 billion in infrastructure during the 11th five year plan the government should release status on project implementation and enumerate the reasons for delays in implementation which in turn could facilitate measures to speed up the implementation of large infrastructure projects
2686420 its terrible and surprising because his parents are such good people
2686421 if it came to troublemaking he was the first to join in
2686422 he really didnt let his parents tell him what to do
2686423 she wouldnt let people know that if she was disappointed
2686424 they said we dont send him money anymore because he has money himself

2686429 our online business has grown dramatically over the last 12 months
2686430 we always knew that there is a huge difference in flavour between supermarket shelf coffee and high quality freshly slow roasted coffee it seems that the increase in use of domestic coffee making equipment combined with the growth of internet shopping had driven a lot of coffee lovers to our previous online store with this in mind we commissioned the development of a new high quality website that was better able to cope with growing customer demand
2686431 we hope our online presence will develop and change over time in response to customer feedback
2686432 we currently freshly roast on demand over 25 top quality world coffees which our customers can easily purchase at the new store we also have a fledgling coffee articles section that should expand over time as well as other coffee related features
2686433 a greater awareness of quality coffee is also a factor in the growth of this business
2686434 we have seen an increase of fha loans originating from 5 percent to 35 percent of our monthly volume over the last year and i wouldnt be surprised to see it go to 50 percent
2686435 in our view its the richness of diversity like a colorful tapestry that makes the world and our neighborhood such a wonderful place
2686436 the woodcut project has been a great opportunity for our brewers to broaden their brewing horizons as well as offer an intriguing and distinctive beer to our customers
2686437 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2686438 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2686439 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2686440 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2686441 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2686442 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2686443 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2686444 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2686445 as 6 decis es mais importantes que voc vai tomar na vida
2686446 when youve got people that are 30 year plus incumbents its smarter to sit on the fence than pick a horse that doesnt win
2686447 the big problem with don is that he used the money he was given for legal fees thats not why people contributed to him so that created incredible uproar amongst the money group
2686448 if you support the lieutenant governor the governor comes with that support so thats one thing but if the congressman ends up winning
2686449 neither of them are raising lots of money people are holding their powder
2686450 the club for growth is one of the most extreme groups in washington d c
2686451 this is a group that does not want to spend any money on alaskans period to me thats wrong a congressman must represent the people of alaska not some special interest group in washington d c
2686452 the large dollar donors are concerned about the potential vindictiveness of the congressman
2686453 im not opposed to earmarks im opposed to earmark abuse
2686454 and the abuse of the process where earmarks are dropped in without public scrutiny tarnishing alaskas reputation
2686455 thats primarily what don youngs war chest is made of is political action committees and gaming interests from puerto rico and louisiana and the like
2686456 sean i think is hopelessly na ve when it comes to the earmark process what a congressman or woman is supposed to do
2686457 or if hes not hopelessly na ve then hes simply pandering to this club for growth i mean a congressman is supposed to be working on ways to bring projects to this state
2686458 when your colleagues in the congress ask for an investigation of you things dont bode well for alaska
2686459 that means people are kind of distancing themselves people in congress and those are the folks that are going to be deciding alaskas fate
2686460 theres a little biblical saying you know judge not that ye be not judged yourself
2686461 i would absolutely bring projects to alaska that have been subject to public scrutiny and the light of day
2686462 i would think its going to be a close contest between young and parnell
2686463 ledoux is the wild card if she does well then the handicap has to go to young if she doesnt do well then parnell
2686464 don might still be able to pull this one off because of gabrielle ledoux which should make supporters of sean parnell pretty concerned because sean was the odds on favorite a few months ago
2686465 it got me a couple of times and i got her a good couple of times i wasnt going to give the bear an easy target
2686466 executive branch employee shouldnt be getting involved in the recruitment process unless its based on merit
2686467 it was my fault i shouldnt have been on that trail
2686468 as soon as i stopped they looked up and started bolting for us
2686469 i kept looking over my shoulder but they kept coming
2686470 i thought if i get off the trail maybe theyll lose me
2686471 she just pounced right through those trees and was on top of me
2686472 she just stayed there for a moment then took off real fast
2686473 ive got to get out i dont have time to lie here
2686474 i thought im going to have to hurl myself into the road here
2686475 if it wasnt me it could have been someone else
2686476 im really glad its getting warm and not cold an ice age would be really bad
2686477 species cant adapt or keep up in an evolutionary sense because everything is happening so fast
2686478 the changes are all happening faster than the models had predicted
2686479 this place if you stay here more than a week they dont provide toilet paper
2686480 people do make choices and some of those choices arent so good
2686481 i want to show them something to think ahead on things to kind of organize things
2686482 thats really hard when theyre in the shelters and moving from place to place
2686483 i hear a lot of people say why cant they go to mcdonalds and get a job flipping hamburgers but mcdonalds has criteria you know they do criminal background checks even if they have a job there they cant pay rent and gas and child care
2686484 i told him if you even think of doing that again think of me sitting on your shoulder
2686485 when you are a young mother you look for guidance and me not having family here i looked into the community
2686486 there was times we sat on the floor for two hours just waiting for him to calm down
2686487 she basically said youre a loving man youre a good man and im pulling for you because i know you can do this she kept saying that

2686521 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2686522 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures

2686556 without private security firms it would be impossible to achieve what were achieving here
2686557 we just dont have the numbers to do everything as an example they secure some of our bases
2686558 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2686559 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their russias borders
2686560 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate ceasefire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2686561 saw flashes of fire and heard sporadic gunshots after the explosions
2686562 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2686563 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2686564 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2686565 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that

2686578 the parents are scared to bring their kids here for karate lessons
2686579 the problems were mild before but now its getting worse
2686580 its just nice to see the people and walk around
2686581 its a fun outing especially if you live nearby and you dont have to take the car
2686582 cooler temperatures delayed development rain in the summer is good but because berries took longer to develop bears have to look around more for replacement food
2686583 its the worst disease a rose can get it has a greyish cast and pustules

2686585 you see them framed against the sky and they look terrific
2686586 so it means they are storing lots of sugar and starches in the root system it bodes well for the forest
2686587 it can stop what we need now is a bit of heat and sunshine to raise the sugar levels in the fruit
2686588 they are huge producing as much seed as possible theyve been taking over and overshadowing a lot of other plants
2686589 they just shook their heads and said these people have to have their policies reviewed
2686590 in that kind of situation a lifeguard is in the position of overseeing the child the same as a daycare worker it may have upset the parents but you have the lifeguard doing a very important duty and they err on the side of caution
2686591 there is a problem with the way they conducted themselves theyre lifeguards theyre not trained in psychology
2686592 we have no problem with them saying theyd like to investigate further but wed like to have a professional come in
2686593 as drivers we have to be so careful of our senior population

2686611 the conversion of hindus to islam happened over a period of time especially in the medieval period the people who embraced islam were not happy with hinduism which has a rigid system
2686612 this system made many people try to escape from it when opportunity arose across the country people from untouchable and other castes which faced discriminations became muslims
2686613 row is not between jammu hindus and kashmiri muslims as branded by some section of the media but rather a fight of nationalist forces against separatist elements
2686614 you can see hindus sikhs and even muslims out on roads to support the movement
2686615 its a movement of four lakh kashmiri pandits who are bearing the brunt of being refugees in their own country for over 19 years and its a movement of every indian who consider jammu and kashmir as integral part of india
2686616 this public outcry is to throw out each and every separatist out of this country so that people of jammu and kashmir and rest of india could shun fear forever and live in peace and tranquillity
2686617 over one lakh bangladeshis who entered india with valid passports and visa are traceless as on date
2686618 we are very optimistic about this it will affect the chinese government they will do something for the benefit of tibet
2686619 that would be a painful thing for our association to go through
2686620 were trying to work behind the scenes to avoid it
2686621 someone was riding it up my driveway and i petted it that was it i wanted to ride it
2686622 the hardest thing for morgan was overcoming the fear of falling off
2686623 it took a year and a half she didnt want to go faster than a walk or a trot but then she progressed very quickly and now rides confidently and handles the cart in driving classes
2686624 i love to ride them brush them just be with them
2686625 and i sure dont mind getting down and dirty we clean the manure and fill the water buckets saddle and bridle the horses for younger kids and then we get a chance to ride
2686626 they earn free rides through the time they give me this can be an expensive sport i paid their entry fee to salmon river as a thank you for helping me so much
2686627 i brush her a lot bring her carrots give her lots of attention she tried to bite me when i first got here but not so much now
2686628 the horse has a baby face and attitude just like me
2686629 but shes really affectionate i pay more attention to her than the other horses here
2686630 the animals all have horsonality ivy bites demi bucks alvin is pushy he doesnt respect a persons space hell bump you and push you away
2686631 its so great being on the horse riding it doing things together with it weve become totally devoted to them i sure dont mind cleaning up after them
2686632 i have three siblings at home all younger and this is quiet compared to hearing them scrapping yelling and crying
2686633 riding a horse is a lot more work than driving in a cart behind the horse riding is an exhilarating feeling
2686634 id rather give up a show to be here riding for a weekend
2686635 i didnt want to be responsible for our second loss in the row i made some mistakes but i hung in there and battled through
2686636 leadoff walks make innings more difficult but he made some good pitches
2686637 i certainly got double plays in spots when i needed them
2686638 a lot of that was hitters just missing those hits i owe it to the guys behind me who turned the double plays
2686639 i just wanted to be careful and attack the inside i remember the last time i faced him he got a hit on a slider
2686640 since we have jacoby ellsbury nine and j d drew one rather than having our fastest guy get stuck behind our catcher and if they want to bring a lefty in it just seems to make some sense it may make them use an extra pitcher
2686641 i remember a lot of times hed come back to the bench even on a ball that wasnt a hit hed say i feel better hes taken some better passes more consistent
2686642 i know hes put in a lot of time and is working hard its starting to pay off for him
2686643 thats the biggest thing relax and be on time be ready to hit
2686644 i dont think it was any great scouting job or great coup on my part
2686645 arizona used the kid we traded to them in the dan haren deal with oakland so it wound up working for them we just knew carlos had a lot of ability and that he was injured in 2007 and that was the reason for the drop off in his play did we think hed have 31 homers in mid august not really but were thrilled and hes been a top performer for us
2686646 we went inside the numbers and spotted trends that we felt were favorable and worth the risk when we signed him as a free agent hes been a terrific pickup for us and we need him back healthy in order to get going with our season and to get where we want to go
2686647 its a chance to play in a stadium that i might get a chance to play in down the road
2686648 at the same time it might be your only chance to play at a stadium like this
2686649 if you dont watch yourself monotony becomes something of a problem
2686650 youve got to find a way each day to try and reinvigorate yourself and be able to take a fresh outlook
2686651 its people at home that would kill to be here right now
2686652 you can feel it just to come in here and play and win a ballgame its a great feeling
2686653 i mean growing up and playing baseball my whole life never had any kind of failure or adversity to go through this year its been a whole ball of adversity trying to find different ways trying to find a routine that works for me that i can stick with
2686654 they know if i get in trouble ill go to off speed stuff and they still dont swing at it
2686655 they get in fastball counts and i have to throw a fastball regardless of where its at somebodys sitting fastball if its not painted on the knees black outside corner its sort of hard for them not to hit
2686656 so ive got to work on getting probably getting ahead in the count a bit more often where they dont have a choice to swing at off speed stuff
2686657 when things werent quite going his way his reliance on his secondary pitches became great and thats where the word around the league became very clear how hitters were going to approach him
2686658 he was well aware that the need for more fastball not only usage but better consistent location is there i know hes working toward that so were seeing that at times
2686659 his secondary stuff is still well above average were still seeing the same consistent action to his curveball but any time you get a pitcher that is more confident his stuff seemingly is more sharp and crisp because theyre pitching more free of mind and thats what were working toward with clay
2686660 ive always been able to throw all my pitches for strikes
2686661 then sometimes when i get behind in the count i feel like oh god
2686662 theres something to it and i feel like im really close to being really good right now just got to keep going after it itll happen sooner or later i think im good enough to go out there and compete and be good at this level
2686663 youve got four teams that are right in the thick of it great players great fans this is what its all about when youre in this type of situation you want to put on a good show for the fans and hopefully we can do that
2686664 i have all i can do to help keep this together
2686665 were in a tough series with one of the best teams in baseball were all focused on winning all the time but the red sox are here and we have to be very good to beat a team like that
2686666 im sure for the city its great i mean how many thousands of people will be in this city this weekend to watch the games here i think thats great but i usually dont pay much attention to whats going on over there with the cubs
2686667 weve got to win our division and keep our players healthy and thriving
2686668 were trying to get through each series hoping that our pitching is strong and we get scott linebrink back soon to shore up our bullpen
2686669 weve done some things to shore up our team and weve done them for a reason were hoping we see the benefits of that
2686670 brought griff in for the offense he could bring but also because of the hunger factor
2686671 he and jim thome have never won a championship i think that desire and hunger will hopefully rub off on the rest of our guys
2686672 when hes hot he can carry a club and when hes cold you want to kill him
2686673 i guess mother nature doesnt want me to hit it out tonight
2686674 the double was hilarious when he thought it was gone
2686675 but youve got to be a strong man to leave this place to left field
2686676 at the same time i think about you know i missed two months of the season im still not 100 percent so i dont want to be too crazy and try to do things that make things get worse
2686677 seemed like for a guy that gave up four hits it seemed like he had to pitch out of some jams
2686678 four double play balls though he made some real good pitches
2686679 i didnt realize at the time i actually thought he had a cramp
2686680 with the defiance of the milf 105th base command to pull out from illegally occupied areas in north cotabato the group has degenerated into a plain bandit group and considered a lost command
2686681 as such today sunday the government forces launched clearing operations in certain barangay in north cotabato as a due course for law enforcement without necessarily being constrained by the ceasefire agreement
2686682 ayaw pa namin nun we dont want that now we still want to find a peaceful way to resolve this
2686683 the election is expected to go on as scheduled that is the feedback that we got from the task force halalan
2686684 this is a gross violation of the ceasefire we will protest
2686685 while we still continue to uphold the primacy of the peace process we have our mandate to protect the civilians and our civilian communities from unlawful acts
2686686 their afp justification is the milf is not following the order but they have been repositioning since yesterday saturday
2686687 right now the joint ceasefire committee is threshing things out so the arrangement can push through but until that is threshed out there will be tensions because the military is continuing to open fire

2686689 last year if we were out on the practice range we threw some deep balls we had some pretty routes we did a lot of things that looked good but the guy on the driving range the guy thats nailing that driver 300 yards that goes out and shoots a 95 is not going to win the tournament
2686690 so i think our guys really understand situational football a lot better this year
2686691 a lot of times when we threw the ball deep it was from 40 and back yates said
2686692 so if we can get the ball deeper into their territory we wont have to worry about taking as many shots
2686693 t j knows how first and second down affects third he knows when hes in four down territory he knows when were going to take shots he knows how one play affects the next just like a golfer knows how one shot affects the next shoop said
2686694 tiger woods only uses a driver they say four times a round we were pulling that thing out probably a dozen last year
2686695 hes going to have to come in and learn formations personnel groupings and those sorts of things
2686696 given whats transpired this year it seems hard to imagine prices could get that low
2686697 but its not inconceivable that prices in the south bay could fall well below the 4 mark

2686704 neither the political conservatives nor the liberals much engaged with actual poor people most conservatives did not know any poor people or families to test their assumptions about poverty and if they ever did come into real contact those assumptions often changed many liberals had little more relationship to poor people than conservatives and generally regarded the poor as objects more than as subjects in social problem solving doing things for rather than with poor people became the liberal strategy
2686705 we have inherited a particularly greek way of understanding the truth that we simply master a body of material and then repeat it back on cue or merely implement the things we have learned but for the hebrews living was meant to change thinking the hebrew way is both more biblical and more revealing of how most of us really do learn and change

2686709 for a lot of couples a honeymoon is the most that theyve ever spent on travel so there really are a lot of expectations placed on this trip
2686710 there is such a trend for the click fast deal but for such an important vacation you really want to think it through
2686711 renting a condo for a week can save you money over staying at a comparatively fancy hotel
2686712 in places like cabo san lucas condos offer good deals
2686713 youll get a full kitchen instead of a minibar and most people arent big enough eaters to make a fancy hotel breakfast buffet worth the money
2686714 a box of cereal and a carton of milk could save you 35 per person per day
2686715 we get a lot of questions about whether all inclusive deals are cheaper
2686716 it depends how you like to travel couples who get the most out of an all inclusive are those who really use all the activities included if you like to dive play golf or drink and be social youll get your moneys worth if you just want to lie on the beach and dont drink you might want to do the math
2686717 people often lump cruises together and think theyre all exactly the same but thats like comparing a four seasons resort to a holiday inn theyre all very different
2686718 dont just jump on the first one you see if one cruise line is 100 cheaper but the age demographic is 20 years older as a honeymooner its not going to be the right fit

2686798 our role in beijing is first of all to measure the performance of the athletes provide results rankings or scores and then distribute them all
2686799 of course we use more and more computer power to give the results but also in terms of measurement of the performance we have more precision and can follow much better what is going on
2686800 it means we measure the position of each boat five times per second so we permanently know where the different competitors are on the lake
2686801 based on this we can define the acceleration of the boat and the number of strokes per second we can also measure the distance between the boats
2686802 for this we have antennas on the road and then we have an electronic tag thats on the lace of the shoes of the athletes
2686803 each athlete has his own electronic identity and then with our computer system we are able to know all along the marathon exactly what is going on
2686804 we have had a team in beijing since january 2005 supported by the staff in switzerland we have intensively prepared and tested all the different elements of the timekeeping results and the distribution

2686870 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic sea ice
2686871 the crucial point is that ice is clearly not building up enough over winter to restore cover and that when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years
2686872 we are rolling out the network very quickly wherever we have been given spectrum so far
2686873 we do understand that there are security concerns in some of the states circles where spectrum cannot be allocated but wherever it is available there should not be any delay as the government had earlier announced in january this year that enough spectrum is available in most of the circles to accommodate all the new players as well to meet the needs of the existing operators

2686880 i think that he is the best striker in the world at the moment and i do not think there is anyone comparable available to have him in our team is very important
2686881 he was a player himself and knows how footballers feel in moments like this and he knew it was a complicated situation
2686882 the coach has supported me since he took at the club and from the first day we have talked about the olympic games
2686883 i spoke to him a bit about beijing but he told me more about when he played and how great it was and that was why he understood my position and why i wanted to stay out here
2686884 he was fantastic with me and i am very grateful for that

2686896 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2686897 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2686898 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2686899 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2686900 if god has created us for relationship with himself why has he made intimacy so difficult we cannot see him or touch him or hear him clearly and yet we are supposed to understand him hes eternal but were trapped within the faculties of mortally frail bodies and minds how do we find peace in knowing we will pursue him for the rest of our lives and never lay hold of him until we step across the threshold of death into his perfect presence

2686906 at the time there were almost no houses no schools no medical facilities at all and one priest with one arm
2686907 we began building the st josephs house of compassion in 1983 on land provided to us by the diocese and finally finished in 1985
2686908 we had a horse and cart to transport villagers who did the work and materials for the building
2686909 the new home had no glass in the windows but was a much needed shelter for many people

2686914 we also have two of our earliest charges now studying at university one is training to be a physiotherapist and desperately wants to be a doctor while another is in training for the priesthood
2686915 we need support and advice to get essential things like construction materials plumbing supplies and water tanks which is extremely difficult in india
2686916 we need financial support to improve the education and supplies we can offer these poor rural families and their children to improve their quality of life in the long term
2686917 hopefully there will be a cure for cancer and in recent years the cancer council have shown there is hope
2686918 cancer is not selective it affects everyone its inspiring to see so many local businesses and everyday people who may not have a lot to give donate to this cause
2686919 last year the young site raised nearly 3 000 which contributed greatly to our total amount
2686920 we have 65 sites across southern nsw and it really is a team effort
2686921 without volunteers there would be no way we could come close to the targets we need
2686922 the children are really enjoying the sandpit although i think we need more shovels
2686923 this support is provided for learning activities for children with challenged abilities to assist them to prepare for their move to big school next year
2686924 activities like these which help develop their abilities to interact with their peers and are of great benefit to all children
2686925 i wasnt very confident when i ran for showgirl but the experience has brought me a lot more confidence and i feel like i have learnt so much this year
2686926 i met many new people and had to really step out of my comfort zone with public speaking i encourage anyone who wants to have a go but isnt sure whether they have the confidence to take it on because you will learn so much
2686927 the entrant will be judged on presentation deportment and general knowledge there is no entry fee and no fundraising involved
2686928 this is not a beauty contest i encourage anyone to have a go we will mentor and assist you all the way through and you wont be thrown in the deep end its a wonderful opportunity
2686929 since the creation of the nsw dpi some staff have approached the department on a voluntary basis seeking redundancy due to their own personal situation
2686930 in some cases these have been granted by the department however from the outset i ordered that frontline services be quarantined from voluntary redundancies
2686931 we are currently looking at getting a horticulturalist for the young office however there are processes that need to be followed
2686932 not only do we want the position filled as soon as possible but we want it to be filled by the best possible person so this takes time to accomplish
2686933 the young office had sue marte as horticulturalist for many years a very able and well respected horticulturalist
2686934 hers will be very big shoes to fill and we want to get it right in the long term
2686935 currently the horticulturalist from orange jeremy bright who is one of the best in the department is travelling to young regularly to provide those services
2686936 obviously we want to have someone on the ground at the earliest opportunity but we will take the time to ensure that we get the right person
2686937 almost 20 per cent of the tourist destinations the nrma surveyed said they would be forced to lay staff off and a further 55 per cent will have to cut back on operating costs
2686938 there has been lots said anecdotally about the impact petrol prices are having on the tourism industry but nobody expected the traditional australian family holiday to have changed so much
2686939 the decision by families to slash their spending by up to 500 and to holiday closer to home means an urgent campaign is needed to boost local tourism
2686940 with families wanting to cut their travel to reduce petrol costs tourist destinations further from metropolitan areas could suffer particularly in areas already struggling with the effects of the drought
2686941 in the most recent national visitors survey for the year ended march 2008 domestic overnight visitor spending for nsw increased by 366 million or 3 1 percent
2686942 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2686943 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2686944 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2686945 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2686946 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2686947 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2686948 the national sheep flock seems to have fallen a further 6 5 percent in the past year to june 2008 although smaller declines in the flock are now anticipated resulting in a base of around 76 million head by 2011
2686949 with another poor breeding season and high lamb turnoff at the end of 2007 lamb slaughter in 2008 is forecast to decline nine percent from the 2007 record to 19 2 million head and production by eight percent to 404 000 tonnes still the second highest production on record
2686950 for those reasons supply is expected to be particularly tight through this winter leading to a high seasonal spike in lamb prices
2686951 the local and global demand and supply balance for lamb continues to tighten providing the prospect of higher lamb prices and attractive returns to lamb producers once seasons improve
2686952 the team has never visited young before usually going to larger centres like wagga dubbo or coffs harbour
2686953 with this visit being such a success they have indicated that they will return for a similar day every two years
2686954 it will be fantastic for locals to be able to have their long term check ups done locally and not have to travel so far afield to see specialist doctors
2686955 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2686956 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2686957 the garden looks grand and the red rose vine is clinging to the gate

2687021 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
2687022 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law in fact there is supreme court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity

2687111 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic sea ice

2687157 im not a regular union flag waver since they usually only seem to defend the workers who have attendance or other abuse problems
2687158 please do not say management is strapped for funds when contract talks begin and state our wages may be frozen and we need to pay more for health care use the money that is wasted every day to offset these expenses
2687159 also im in favor of bringing back operators laid off a while ago but not when were sitting around looking at each other however the authority thinks differently and some are being brought back now doesnt someone see what is going on
2687160 i have a few friends who work for pat and it is an unwritten rule that you call off sick so other drivers can get your shift and the accompanying overtime privatize the thing and be done with it
2687161 management would work us 15 16 hours and the next day they may have kept you around for three or four hours imagine having a job like that think about it also i know someone with a bad back who was off on workers comp for years while he worked as a constable when he came back he was put in charge of a department in a newly created job no politics here right

2687169 beijing has invested more effort and more resources into the environment than any other olympic host city before and i think the diversity of measures here that have been taken have been very impressive
2687170 in the areas of particle matter water resources management water quality there is significant room for further development and finally the question is will beijing continue to invest in its public transport infrastructure and i think that will be a big test for the long term impact of the games
2687171 im not downplaying this race by any means but i have to put that race behind me
2687172 i have to act like it never happened because i have so many tough races ahead of me
2687173 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2687174 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2687175 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2687176 we had a deal i told bob that i wanted this to be my last 400 im he said i have to end on a record
2687177 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2687178 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2687179 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2687180 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for

2687182 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2687183 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2687184 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2687185 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2687186 everyone did a great job and were really happy with silver because i dont think we were even expecting that
2687187 if you get the women who are 50 to 64 to join the women who are over 65 youve got a strategy for beating obama

2687190 i expect youll see mccain do well with older voters not because of his age but because of his politics
2687191 its really sad after the celebration of the opening ceremonies which were the best opening ceremonies ive ever been at
2687192 to the best of my knowledge this is a random action and not targeted at americans its just that you dont expect something to happen in a country like this
2687193 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2687194 the chinese government will try not to let this event have a serious impact on u s china relations
2687195 of course its a little scary but any time you have so many coming together there is a chance that something like this would happen
2687196 im very surprised because all of the locals we have met say its very safe
2687197 clyde held on and struggled for 37 hours after we removed life support friday evening thats who he was thats what he was a fighter and those two took him away from us

2687199 this is just a senseless crime that needs to be taken care of these young men deliberately meant to commit bodily harm on my brother and they succeeded in what they wanted to do
2687200 we would probably stay busier if we were a little closer to downtown but we wouldnt have all this pointing to the panoramic river view boaters tell us this is the best part of the river

2687215 its fun to watch good lawyers i love the factual parts of cases watching witnesses testify and seeing how things unfold
2687216 im the objective person inside the courtroom and outside with written submissions
2687217 ok mr petro youve already objected once you dont need to object again
2687218 has every quality you could possibly hope for in a judge shes very professional efficient hardworking

2687220 if you were supposed to be in at 11 for curfew you better be there at two minutes till
2687221 she inherited two things from her mother her petiteness and her sweetness
2687222 of course these qualities disarm people into thinking she is frail and timid this conclusion is far from the truth
2687223 see any difference between the government and the court in this case
2687224 if it didnt hurt too bad to lose id say it would be a joy to be against her
2687225 i want grizzled old guys and young mean looking men opposing me
2687226 grand dismissive self important striving humorless full of social and political zeal
2687227 she rules fairly shes prompt in her rulings and shes much more efficient than the lawyers who come before her
2687228 shes fair as heck even when youre fighting with her

2687231 the people of denver by popular vote commanded the erection of this building
2687232 denver was a city run by city bosses really from the 1880s through mayor ben stapleton which means in the 1940s
2687233 whatever you can say about it mayors could get things done the price was it was not a very democratic way of doing business
2687234 a lot of the real decisions were not made in the convention but at the brown palace and at the albany hotel

2687239 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2687240 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2687241 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger

2687247 the omagh community spirit i read so much about in newspaper articles never existed for me
2687248 as a council we have tried to do our best to mark the anniversary i realise its a sensitive time and different people will react differently

2687251 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2687252 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2687253 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2687254 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2687255 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2687256 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2687257 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2687258 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2687302 last season was a tough one for me and there were lots of things that maybe meant i didnt have all of my focus on football
2687303 but thats in the past and im now fresh and ready for the new season
2687304 i had a lot of bad luck last season but now it feels good to be back again
2687305 i thought i did well against benfica i had good delivery and scored a goal from a free kick
2687306 ive been on set pieces before but last year things werent going my way so the job got taken off me
2687307 i had three good seasons before that but sometimes you take two steps forward and one back so maybe last year was the step back now though its time to step forwards again
2687308 ive been working hard on all aspects of my game and that seems to be paying off for me at the moment
2687309 hopefully ive shown the manager what i can do in pre season and now i need to keep that up
2687310 on the plus side you get some good time off and that allows you to let your body recover one hundred per cent
2687311 for me it was also important to recover mentally as well and i did that this summer so maybe it was good for me this time to miss out
2687312 we opened them up with some good passing but i was very disappointed with their goal
2687313 im disappointed we didnt win but morecambe are difficult to break down away and i was very pleased we created more chances
2687314 we should be first to it in our box but first game of the season i imagine some of the boys brains were getting a bit tired at that time
2687315 we could have been ahead before they scored and i am pleased with the way that we came back

2687347 pornography is the presentation or production of sexually explicit pictures writing or other material whose primary purpose is to cause sexual arousal

2687545 its the nature of the sports business and certainly the position i play for that to become a legitimate question the negative side is part of the culture of sports

2687547 sometimes you have to care about the way it looks
2687548 that was more the writers opinion than mine i didnt tell him that
2687549 that in this job you have to worry a lot about perception but i still dont to me the only perception that matters is winning winning makes it reality again thats just sports
2687550 heres what i was thinking when we took that trip get some buddies and get some girls and on a free weekend take a trip to the beach relax sit around and watch football buddies and girls and watching football i like all that
2687551 i still feel like i made a good choice but with a laugh i guess it didnt exactly work out that way but if we win like i think we can win all the perception questions will be answered just win
2687552 statistically it looks all right ws and ls its ok but theres just so much more to do and the question about what i need to do has an easy answer go to work work every day at being better ive got to be better
2687553 there is a next level out there ive got to reach it
2687554 i know its only training camp and only a week and a half of that but this is by far the best weve looked offensively since ive been here
2687555 normally the defense comes in ahead of the offense but that hasnt been the case we should be a good offense and be a good team period i think so anyway the expectations are high and that starts with me
2687556 i read that and i think you guys have that all wrong there will be some things happen at receiver this season you guys are not expecting these young receivers will emerge several of them in fact does one of them stand out yes and i will tell you his name but dont print it just watch and see if im right
2687557 you just try to make the most out of the situation
2687558 i feel like we came out strong weve just got to finish up the second half of the game was the big difference but we still have three more weeks of the preseason to get it right
2687559 it just didnt turn out the way we wanted it to turn out
2687560 did all right thats a really good defensive front they were pretty pumped up
2687561 theyre grinders they run hard every day and they ran hard tonight
2687562 it was clogged up in the middle and there wasnt anybody outside
2687563 it was a good feeling to get in there hopefully thatll happen many more times
2687564 we have a pretty good idea of what steven is capable of doing and there is quite a bit unknown about our younger backs
2687565 i think its a great opportunity for the other guys to move up the ladder and get reps with the other groups
2687566 obviously you want steven back hes a great running back
2687567 he got a taste of it last season and now here he is running with the first unit and hes taking advantage of it hes running the ball really well
2687568 were working on our depth while we wait for steven to get in so you have to look at that as a positive

2687599 were trying to change the paradigm of human democracy of human governance and thats what this nyc 9 11 ballot initiative is all about changing the paradigm of human governance right here in new york city by asserting that you saw something wrong that took place and you want to address it through using the tool of the initiative the legislative power of citizenry to go after that fundamental change

2687602 freud divided the ids drives and instincts into two categories life and death instincts the latter not so usually regarded because freud thought of it later in his lifetime life instincts are those that are crucial to pleasurable survival such as eating and copulation death instincts as stated by freud are our unconscious wish to die as death puts an end to the everyday struggles for happiness and survival freud noticed the death instinct in our desire for peace and attempts to escape reality through fiction media and substances such as alcohol and drugs
2687603 the ego is that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world the ego represents what may be called reason and common sense the ego is the mediator between the id and the super ego trying to ensure that the needs of both the id and the super ego are satisfied it is said to operate on a reality principle meaning it deals with the id and the super ego allowing them to express their desires drives and morals in realistic and socially appropriate ways it is said that the ego stands for reason and caution developing with age sigmund freud had used an analogy which likened the ego to a rider and a horse the ego being the rider while the id being the horse the horse provides the energy and the means of obtaining the energy and information need while the rider ultimately controls the direction it wants to go however due to unfavorable conditions sometimes the horse makes its own decisions over the rocky terrain
2687604 when the ego is personified it is like a slave to three harsh masters the id the super ego and the external world
2687605 the super ego comprises that organised part of the personality structure mainly but not entirely unconscious that includes the individuals ego ideals spiritual goals and the psychic agency commonly called conscience that criticizes and prohibits his or her drives fantasies feelings and actions

2687667 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2687668 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2687669 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2687670 es sieht so aus als h tten sie meinen bruder gefunden
2687671 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2687672 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2687673 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2687674 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2687675 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2687720 i think with time well eventually be working out of middle east e gaming development warehouses and selling by online websites
2687721 because people hardly come to our stores in person anymore
2687722 and where there was once one or two big internet marketing firms now there are well over ten in our industry this growth speaks to the power of the information super high way
2687723 i prefer to take my time and read about it all online first
2687724 im not a high pressure sales type and rather just go to the store and check out sas soon as possible
2687725 things in the industry really turned a corner when people began to acquire not maintain customers online
2687726 when acquisiton via online services got big companies in the middle east e gaming development sector finally woke up to the idea that the information super highway was here to stay in a very big way
2687727 with internet middle east e gaming development sales booming we may have to cut back on in person sales teams
2687728 mainly because we are losing money in that operational area as we move forward well give those employees new job opportunities in our middle east e gaming development company before we actually lay them off so that they can continue to grow with our company if they so desire
2687729 i was working 9 to 5 at a marketing firm doing the typical corporate thing now however i have my own website production center and payment processing this allows me to work from home under my own rules and with unlimited income potential
2687730 after starting an internet middle east e gaming development sales division in 2003 we saw our sales increase three fold
2687731 and this resulted in the creation of more jobs and employment opportunities in our company our number of employees has doubled and our number of it staff has quadrupled in a years time
2687732 when we added a website and shopping cart system our numbers went through the roof
2687733 this teamed with high positioning in the major search engines really created a whole new market for us that was never expected

2687779 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
2687780 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
2687781 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
2687782 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
2687783 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
2687784 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
2687785 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
2687786 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
2687787 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
2687788 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
2687789 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
2687790 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
2687791 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
2687792 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
2687793 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
2687794 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
2687795 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
2687796 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
2687797 this is a call to the global community that it is possible to increase pediatric cancer survival even in countries that have high under 5 mortality rates for other causes such as infectious diseases

2687800 the data show a modest investment in health if it is well organized can produce an incredible increase in pediatric cancer survival
2687801 countries with limited resources should not be afraid to tackle pediatric cancer as a national health priority because they can have decent programs if they make a relatively small investment
2687802 and that investment can come from outside sources as well
2687803 a major issue we face in managing patients with recurrent sarcomas is the paucity of active agents
2687804 there is a limited number of drugs that are active against bone sarcomas and these are usually used as front line treatments when the sarcomas recur we have essentially no active agents
2687805 we were first very careful to see whether we would see any excess toxicity in children compared to that seen in adults
2687806 when we found that the combination was well tolerated we used it in more patients since our colleagues at rady childrens hospital were also using it for refractory sarcoma we decided to pool our data
2687807 further evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in these patients
2687808 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
2687809 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
2687810 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
2687811 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
2687812 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
2687813 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
2687814 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
2687815 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
2687816 target presents varietys power of youth campaign is a powerful one one that harnesses the energy of more than 150 young performers who are in a position to influence their peers and fans with the support of target and our other sponsors the power of youth effort has the opportunity to generate millions of dollars to benefit st jude childrens research hospital and create a bedrock of social awareness within the next generation of entertainment
2687817 our partnership educates and encourages young individuals to take action in their community
2687818 this event is important to target because of our long standing relationship with st jude childrens research hospital and the meaningful work they do
2687819 my father opened the doors of st jude through the generosity of the entertainment community
2687820 target and variety continue the tradition of entertainers giving back to people in need the dedication and enthusiasm of young hollywood and partners like variety and target enables us to carry on my fathers vision that no child should die in the dawn of life
2687821 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
2687822 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
2687823 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
2687824 these findings emphasize that patients with aml especially those with high white blood cell count should be treated in an experienced tertiary center with a good supportive care team
2687825 for example at st jude we have a dedicated team of clinicians taking care of aml patients and they are more aware of the need to treat hyperleukocytosis are more experienced and are more vigilant in patient care than is usually found at a less specialized hospital
2687826 even though we had dramatically reduced early deaths in this group of patients in the latter period of the study the long term result for patients with these complications was still not good
2687827 we have continued to address their problems with new treatment approaches and have now improved not only the early results but also their long term outcome
2687828 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
2687829 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
2687830 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
2687831 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
2687832 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
2687833 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
2687834 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
2687835 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
2687836 what we a found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
2687837 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
2687838 gene expression profiling will help us identify targets for future therapy
2687839 it is still crude but in the end you identify multiple genes for further study if you find a good target for therapy the next step is to develop molecular therapeutics for the target
2687840 pharmacogenetics is important to finding out a persons response and tolerance for a therapy
2687841 certain drugs may be good for 99 percent of patients but bad for 1 percent we need to find out who those patients are who are at risk so we can spare them from toxicity
2687842 we need to know the leukemic cell genetics that affect drug sensitivity or resistance and what role pharmacogenetics plays in treatment to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity
2687843 that way we dont over treat low risk patients or under treat high risk patients
2687844 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
2687845 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
2687846 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
2687847 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
2687848 what we found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
2687849 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
2687850 proteasome inhibitors are currently being used to treat some types of cancer including multiple myelomas although many aspects of this cellular process remain poorly understood
2687851 our study sheds new light on how that process works
2687852 we wanted to determine what happens to defective heavy and light chains in plasma cells so we could get a better understanding of the molecules and channels that allow these cells to get rid of defective proteins that cant be used to make antibodies
2687853 the class of cancer drugs called proteasome inhibitors block endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation as well as the destruction of proteins from other parts of the cells and cause defective proteins to overload this system
2687854 we want to fully understand how endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation works for antibodies made by plasma cells so we can design more specific ways to block this process in myelomas
2687855 our study shows for the first time the role herp plays at the retrotranslocon
2687856 the study also describes how non glycosylated proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum and disposed of this information helps to explain how the process works and how we might design ways to block it in cancer cells
2687857 in addition to fulfilling your new years fitness resolutions and raising needed funds for the children of st jude this is also your opportunity to be a part of history by creating a new guinness world record for the most abdominal crunches done in one hour by a group
2687858 im extremely proud to lead this national campaign to benefit a very worthy cause while educating women on the importance of strengthening their core as a first step to greater fitness
2687859 st jude is an incredible research center where doctors and researchers are committed to saving the lives of children with cancer and other deadly diseases
2687860 our family is forever grateful for the courageous people at st jude and all that they do ab crunch challenge participants will be a part of a vital team supporting the hospitals life saving work and ensuring that no child is ever turned away because of a familys inability to pay
2687861 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
2687862 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
2687863 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
2687864 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
2687865 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
2687866 our report reflects how adept st jude has become at designing and conducting even complex clinical trials for twinning through iop
2687867 this is a powerful strategy for sharing our knowledge and skills with countries that have excellent clinicians but limited resources
2687868 through twinning we can ensure delivery of state of the art therapy to children in other countries while identifying additional research opportunities
2687869 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
2687870 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
2687871 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
2687872 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
2687873 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
2687874 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
2687875 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
2687876 long lived cells like those in the brain arent constantly being replaced like red blood cells are
2687877 these cells must have a way to remain healthy for a long time getting rid of mitochondria that threaten the cell by making ros is one of those strategies
2687878 the fact that reticulocytes must eject their mitochondria in order to form red blood cells makes it the perfect model for studying programmed mitochondrial clearance
2687879 the identification of nix as a protein that regulates programmed mitochondrial clearance is a significant advance because of the importance of this process in the health of long lived cells like those in the heart and brain
2687880 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
2687881 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
2687882 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
2687883 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
2687884 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
2687885 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children

2687887 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
2687888 these findings provide new avenues to pursue to gain a better understanding of these disease processes and ultimately to develop better therapies
2687889 it really takes a series of genetic lesions to lead to cancer
2687890 you may get activation of an oncogene but you may also need activation of a tumor suppressor gene and an alteration in a cell death pathway
2687891 it appears from our study and other work published previously that all you need to get cml is that chromosomal translocation and bcr abl1 expression
2687892 the vast majority of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of b cell lineage
2687893 the loss of the ikaros gene is a nearly obligatory lesion for the development of bcr abl1 all
2687894 and clearly must be a genetic lesion that is cooperating with bcr abl1
2687895 that is an important finding that may give insight into how that transformation occurs or it may give insight into a better way to treat the disease if one can figure out how the ikaros deletion is working
2687896 its time to hand the torch to the next generation of young people to continue this important role of st jude in the international community
2687897 dr websters legacy is that he has highlighted the importance of the avian reservoir of influenza as it relates to human health
2687898 we now know that the avian reservoir is the initial source for all human flu he has helped the world understand that we need to keep an eye on whats going on in the animal populations and communicate with each other about those changes
2687899 richard has attended who meetings and has been accepted by the international community
2687900 autophagy is a cell survival jack of all trades and were trying to understand the signals that trigger its onset
2687901 this process developed so early in the evolution of life that at least some types of microorganisms must have learned how to avoid this defensive response of the cell to being invaded we want to know how invading microorganisms avoid being destroyed by autophagy and learn how cancer cells use autophagy to resist chemotherapy drugs before they have a chance to work
2687902 we suspected that because tlr signaling triggers both phagocytosis and autophagy that this signal might also link these activities together as well as enable each process to occur separately
2687903 this would make sense since autophagy kills microorganisms that invade the cell and phagocytosis deliberately brings microorganisms into the cell to destroy them so having two totally separate and unrelated sets of signals to do a similar job would be like re inventing the biochemical wheel
2687904 this strongly suggested that tlr recruits parts of the autophagy machinery to enable the phagosome to fully develop and fuse with the lysosome even if autophagy itself doesnt occur simultaneously
2687905 we can actually see phagocytosis take place in live cells and we can study it in detail so we know the steps involved
2687906 but autophagy seems to occur suddenly and we know about it only after its very obviously underway now that we discovered that phagocytosis uses some of the same biochemical signals as autophagy does we can use that information to solve the mystery of how autophagy works we hope that we will be able to translate that new knowledge in the future into improved treatments for infections and cancer
2687907 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
2687908 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
2687909 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
2687910 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
2687911 this motility is also called dancing because when you electrically stimulate an outer hair cell with a sound the cell body spontaneously elongates and contracts along with the sound
2687912 it is very dramatic to see these hair cells dance with the sound
2687913 we found that these mice showed exactly the same kinds of hearing deficiency as the previous knockout mice
2687914 therefore we believe that these experiments eliminate criticism of our earlier experiments with the knockout mice
2687915 with this study we still cannot really exclude stereociliary motility from contributing to cochlear amplification because eliminating somatic motility also reduces ciliary motility so it is not possible to totally isolate either form of motility in fact we hypothesize that the two mechanisms might work together in different aspects of amplification
2687916 for example an overdose of aspirin causes a high frequency hearing loss by inhibiting prestins function
2687917 also there is evidence that many cases of high frequency hearing loss are caused by defects in the cells molecular machinery that involves prestin and two mutations that have been detected in the prestin gene in humans are reported to be associated with deafness
2687918 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
2687919 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
2687920 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
2687921 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
2687922 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
2687923 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
2687924 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
2687925 decreased levels of transforming growth factor beta and increased levels of jnk are known to be associated with the transformation of myeloid cells into leukemic cells in humans
2687926 so those findings in our lab suggest once again that n myc is linked to aml
2687927 by eliminating il 3 from the culture we were able to unmask the apoptotic effect of n myc which greatly increased cell death
2687928 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
2687929 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
2687930 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
2687931 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
2687932 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
2687933 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
2687934 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
2687935 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
2687936 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
2687937 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
2687938 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
2687939 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
2687940 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
2687941 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
2687942 because the control of cancer in the bone marrow has improved so much cns relapse has become proportionally more important
2687943 if we are to further increase the cure rate and improve the quality of life of our patients we need to concentrate on preventing cns relapse
2687944 most clinicians still feel strongly that high risk patients need radiation treatment because they think that without radiation such patients have a very high risk of relapse
2687945 but i disagree i think that we should avoid using radiation in all patients even those at high risk of relapse with optimal chemotherapy we can reduce the relapse rate to a very low level we should reserve radiation for the treatment of relapse whats more the salvage rate for cns relapse in patients who did not receive prior radiation is very high and if patients who are treated with radiation develop bone marrow or cns relapse later on it is more difficult to treat them successfully
2687946 optimization of intrathecal therapy to allow adequate distribution of intrathecal therapy in the cns and to avoid traumatic lumbar puncture which leads to an increase in cns relapse are essential for the success of cns directed treatment
2687947 however there are no conclusive trials that show this approach to be superior to intensive chemotherapy
2687948 so whether transplantation has any role in the treatment of isolated cns relapse is uncertain
2687949 cns relapse may just be the tip of the iceberg meaning that while we may see cns relapse there may be hidden leukemia in the bone marrow
2687950 at st jude our treatment protocols involve detecting subclinical cns leukemia early and treating it aggressively
2687951 such treatment has allowed both good cns and bone marrow control therefore we have achieved excellent outcomes for our patients
2687952 effector t cells mediate immune responses like accelerators make cars go forward while a specialized population called regulatory t cells stop an immune response like brakes slow down a car
2687953 regulatory t cells actively suppress the activation of effector t cells that are reactive and damaging to self tissues thereby preventing autoimmune disease
2687954 in the context of an infection after the effector t cell has orchestrated the correct immune response and the pathogen is gone regulatory t cells can help calm down the immune system
2687955 in contrast there are very few that issue stop signals only two or three so il 35 is special
2687956 this discovery adds significantly to our understanding of how these cells prevent immune responses from running out of control and causing damage
2687957 to return to the car analogy il 35 may turn out to be a very important brake for the immune system
2687958 there is mounting evidence that regulatory t cells stop our ability to eradicate tumors
2687959 tumors produce a dilemma within the immune system on one hand the system wants to get rid of the tumor cells but on the other hand theyre a part of us thus regulatory t cells may prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor experimental studies have shown that if you can remove regulatory t cells or dampen their activity then tumor immunity becomes vigorous and the body can get rid of the tumor
2687960 regulatory t cells are seen as a major impediment to the development of effective anti cancer vaccines and may prevent sterilizing immunity in certain chronic infections such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis
2687961 blocking the activity of il 35 may reduce the function of regulatory t cells and their ability to block anti tumor immune responses so treatments that block il 35 activity may make anti cancer vaccines more effective
2687962 when i interviewed with dario he said the best thing about st jude is that your only limitation is your imagination and he was right
2687963 one of the best things about science is the fact that your discovery attracts the interest of other bright minds other scientists will hear about il 35 and say maybe this new protein is important in the disease process or condition that im studying by collaborating with others whose expertise is different than ours we can hasten progress
2687964 i believe this protein has a good chance of having therapeutic applications
2687965 im a st jude donor myself and like other donors i think its important to remember that at the end of the day the goal of our research is to treat patients especially the children we have here at st jude
2687966 one of the main reasons my family and i support st jude is because there is always something you can do for someone else
2687967 it costs more than 1 2 million a day to run st jude so every penny counts whats really cool about st jude is that it doesnt matter about things like race religion or a familys inability to pay they are really here to help the kids and that is what is really important it is great to be able to encourage kids to learn and help other kids at the same time
2687968 jim nantz has received many awards and honors in his outstanding career with cbs sports
2687969 to have the honor to present him an award that bears my name will indeed be a very special moment for me
2687970 a series of complex developmental processes must be carefully orchestrated for the eye to form correctly
2687971 one important aspect of this coordination is that retinal thickness be the same irrespective of eye size for example the mouse eye is about 5 000 times smaller than that of the elephant eye but the retinal thickness in these two species is comparable
2687972 this represents the first example of a role for a myc gene in retinal development
2687973 on the basis of our data we propose that n myc plays a central role in coordinating retinal proliferation with eye growth during development
2687974 the determination of n myc target genes during retinal development may also contribute to the current understanding of retinoblastoma progression
2687975 importantly for retinas to maintain nearly constant thickness across species that have different sizes of eyes the total number of retinal cells must change several fold
2687976 the identification of n myc as a key regulator of these processes allows us to begin to understand the coordination of complex developmental programs in the developing eye and how these processes have evolved
2687977 we can all make a difference in the lives of others im proud to help st jude i feel like im just a regular person helping out
2687978 through their dedication nearly 75 000 chilis grill amp bar team members made the 2007 create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign a resounding success
2687979 this years campaign once again exceeded our highest expectations totaling more than 8 2 million for the patients of st jude bringing us closer to our goal of raising 50 million and making the chilis care center building we are dedicating today a reality
2687980 as we stand at the foot of the chilis care center in celebration today i want to thank chilis grill amp bar and our other partners who helped make this dream possible we are truly overwhelmed by your dedication to help st jude provide unsurpassed patient care and unparalleled scientific research and you can know that you have helped bring hope to thousands of children from around the world
2687981 the chilis care center is a significant part of our long term strategy to translate basic research at st jude into the most advanced and effective care of patients
2687982 integrating patient care and research holds the key to more rapid advances in science and medicine this new facility will help us maintain our leadership role in defining the forefront of research to advance the treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic pediatric diseases
2687983 give thanks for the healthy kids in your life and give to those who are not
2687984 i am so proud that these buildings are joining the thanks and giving campaign to support st jude
2687985 each year the samaritan award is given to a broadcaster or organization that exemplifies the industrys commitment to serving the public interest through the airwaves
2687986 country cares is a program that truly embodies the spirit of this award as apparent through their tireless fundraising efforts and dedication to serving the patients of st jude childrens research hospital
2687987 showcase is a fun filled weekend of events for the whole family to enjoy it features mans best friend working to provide funds for the best friend of children in need st jude
2687988 this is truly a win win event because the thousands of out of town exhibitors also have a major impact on the memphis economy
2687989 if you go out to eat for lunch or dinner on september 24 by going to chilis you will help seriously ill children become the ultimate survivors on that day chilis restaurants nationwide will be donating all their profits to support st jude
2687990 at univision and at each of the local stations in the univision radio network we are proud of the role we play for hispanics in the united states
2687991 our work with st jude is another example of our commitment to our communities the amazing response of our staff and listeners since we started our partnership 10 years ago demonstrates the importance of the st jude message of hope
2687992 we are very fortunate to have the support from univision radio and the hispanic community to ensure that no child is ever turned away from receiving treatment because of a familys inability to pay
2687993 we want the community to know that every donation even as little as 20 a month makes a difference in saving a childs life at st jude
2687994 part of my job is to motivate people when i see this for myself i want to make sure we have a very successful radiothon
2687995 eighty five percent of every dollar received comes to the hospital thats a very high number for any charity
2687996 i saw every hallway every child and every smile as i was sharing with my listeners
2687997 it makes you feel good to know you are a part of this
2687998 all of the materials are provided for you and are ready to use so all we had to do was make it happen
2687999 with st jude we play our music our format isnt disrupted
2688000 even if a radio station isnt ready to put on their own radiothons
2688001 they should definitely visit another stations event to see what goes on
2688002 the people that tune you in keep us moving forward
2688003 on behalf of the entire global stanford financial group of companies let me say how honored we are to present this check to st jude childrens research hospital
2688004 this tournament is the flagship event for stanfords global relationship with st jude and we look forward to continuing to work together to raise funds and awareness for the battle against childhood cancer we were very pleased with the success of this years tournament our first as title sponsor and to be able to present the largest donation in the history of this event is a true honor for me st jude and these incredible kids is the reason we are involved and im delighted that we can do our part to help st jude work its miracles
2688005 with our donation today and as we have for the last 22 years fedex has supported the incredibly important work being done at st jude childrens research hospital
2688006 we remain strongly committed to this great organization through our continued involvement with the stanford st jude championship and we look forward to carrying on our charitable giving on a national level through the many opportunities with our sponsorship of the fedexcup
2688007 obviously i have my own motivation to make as many eagles as possible but with the eagles for st jude program theres an even greater reward when i do so eagles for st jude allows me to share that good feeling that i have on the golf course and turn it into something truly lasting and meaningful off the golf course i feel like my accomplishments help st jude accomplish its mission to find cures for these special children
2688008 we are grateful to stanford financial group and fedex for their commitment to make this event even more successful than in years past to see a professional like vijay singh get behind our event and support it with both his time and his money is very gratifying we see the stanford st jude championship only growing and we know thats because of the sincere and long term commitment by these incredible partners
2688009 making eagles on the tour takes on a whole new meaning with the eagles for st jude program because i know my accomplishments help st jude achieve its mission to find cures for these special children
2688010 it touches my heart to see these brave kids they have so much courage to fight it makes me feel proud every time i make an eagle and it gives me added drive and passion to play my best golf
2688011 st jude is vital in the battle against catastrophic childhood diseases and we want the world to know it it is our hope that the eagles for st jude program will increase awareness for this special place and encourage golf fans and those who support st jude to donate to this worthy cause
2688012 eagles for st jude is a wonderfully unique program that shows stanfords amazing commitment to the kids of st jude it will be thrilling to watch the eagles accumulating throughout the pga tour knowing that each one will help support st judes ground breaking research and life saving care
2688013 both alison and adam are so excited they cant believe their luck its all they are talking about
2688014 alison is just over the three month mark and is relieved that everything is fine
2688015 alison and adam are over the moon theyre thrilled and delighted
2688016 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
2688017 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
2688018 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
2688019 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
2688020 there are a lot of heroes out there in radio who continue to make this happen
2688021 im just so happy and surprised by all the people especially in country music whove taken st jude to heart
2688022 he put on a mask too when we had our picture taken together
2688023 im just excited to be here doing what i can to help
2688024 the artists who come here need to take what theyve learned and pass it on the type of care offered here is revolutionary
2688025 all these people took the time out of their busy schedules to come here and help the kids
2688026 i dont want people to ever forget about st jude
2688027 were going to have a banner hanging in our student union that says we are the 2006 2007 national champions
2688028 but the only thing harder than being no 1 is staying no 1
2688029 i have no idea if we are going to reach it but we will give it our best shot
2688030 for the first three years i helped peripherally i got prizes for their events
2688031 i saw it as a program that had a lot of potential
2688032 i thought it was something we could really turn into something big
2688033 weve had some great support and some great students and it has worked out for us these past few years
2688034 what i had been told about the hospital didnt compare to what it is actually like there
2688035 talking with students from other colleges and hearing about the programs that work for them was very educational
2688036 it gives us new ideas on what we can do at our campus
2688037 if we start making it a competition we lose sight of what st jude is about
2688038 we have 16 000 people on our campus and 10 percent of them participate in the event id like to believe we can get more than that if we do our job right in promoting the hospital the money will come
2688039 all the things that i wish i had told him all the thanks the news i could still tell him the conversation goes on
2688040 surely you must have some sort of defense mechanism that enables you to look away from all that sadness or numb yourself to the horror of a dying child
2688041 i have to be honest i didnt know much about st jude childrens research hospital before the create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign in 2006
2688042 that was my first introduction to the hospital and i was real excited about the fundraiser i got involved right away in doing whatever i could to make it a success but i have to say that this year is so much more personal for me
2688043 there was a pearl like reflective glow to her eye
2688044 we looked at them wondering if this was going to be katie soon
2688045 a lot of times in children as young as katie the treatment breaks down the bones in the face
2688046 they were tactful and truthful that meant a lot we made the decision based on quality of life concerns we felt it was best for her but that didnt make it easy
2688047 even people we just briefly met they all let us know that they were there for whatever we needed
2688048 we got messages and e mails from chilis employees all over the country sending us their thoughts and prayers
2688049 thats huge thats huge when youre going through this theyve given us all the time off weve needed to take care of our family were very grateful to have that
2688050 it was a shock to see her hooked up to the iv lines and oxygen
2688051 well forget that she lost an eye we honestly forget
2688052 we joke that every time she comes home from the hospital she has a new toy
2688053 once she gets outside she loves nothing better than just running through the grass
2688054 if we find a resource to help us and we think it might help another store we share it
2688055 i think this approach will be just as effective if not more
2688056 i see the other survivors and i know even though we shared a different time and a different era that we all have the same thing in common
2688057 we were all patients here at a place that was our last hope
2688058 because we share a common background we understand the little quirks that may pop up
2688059 having gone through the same thing we know exactly what we need to do for each other to make things better
2688060 its amazing all the changes since 1998 when we were last here
2688061 we speak frequently and proudly about the medical marvels that take place within the walls of st jude
2688062 but we all know none of this could be accomplished without the love dedication and financial support of each and every volunteer partner corporate sponsor and donor it is because of you that the most gifted doctors and scientists in the world come here to do their finest work
2688063 but because they are priceless god has blessed us with an army of truly dedicated individuals who are committed to the dream of danny thomas and the mission of st jude
2688064 i know if my father were here he would want randy to have this award
2688065 i didnt have the chance to know him as well as some of you but it shows you how a good man can inspire you in just a brief time
2688066 a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his clothes and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
2688067 and many came that way and when they saw him passed by on the other side
2688068 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
2688069 and went to him and bound up his wounds and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
2688070 and on the next day when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the inn keeper and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever though spendest more when i come again i will repay you
2688071 one hundred and one years ago our people began a migration to the blessed shores of these united states of america seeking the freedoms and opportunities won for us by our founding fathers
2688072 therefore we who are proud of our heritage have met in washington d
2688073 we at long long last shall take our rightful place in this community of nationalities standing proudly with our heads held high in the knowledge that we have earned the right to perpetuate the name of our heritage and maintain our reputation as unquestioned good american citizens
2688074 with these thoughts engraved in my mind and my heart i shall call upon that powerful patron st
2688075 to this preamble i hereby dedicate my life and affix my signature
2688076 thanks to the 13 chefs for their work in preparing the meals for guests and to mikey flowers who filled our space with beautiful flowers of all kinds
2688077 we raised 610 000 for the hospital and had a wonderful time going about it my thanks to the forbes family for allowing us the use of their yacht which added to the events theme
2688078 thanks to everyone that made our st jude event one very classy night to remember god bless all the people involved with st jude and god bless all the children
2688079 show me my way in life and i will build you a shrine
2688080 non profit non sectarian charitable corporation titled alsac dedicated to the parable of the good samaritan to love and care for our neighbor regardless of color or creed
2688081 i call it the hand of god pushing williams pencil
2688082 as alsac celebrates its 50th anniversary we recognize the organizations unwavering support for st jude
2688083 we are immensely proud of the fact that no child has ever been turned away from st jude because of an inability to pay and we at alsac know that our success and the success of the hospital has been solely dependent on the kindness and generosity of our donors alsac was founded on the principle of the good samaritan we have been fortunate to know and call as friends hundreds of thousands of good hearted donors in our half century of service
2688084 i think its best described in the way brooklyn smiles every day how shes a beautiful vibrant outspoken 3 year old and the way shes so full of life
2688085 for the past five years countless latin artists and singers have truly embraced the life mission of st jude by supporting the angels amp stars gala
2688086 thanks to their contribution and charitable donations they are helping us save the lives of children with deadly diseases
2688087 fedex is proud to continue increasing critical awareness and philanthropic support for st jude
2688088 by partnering with talented celebrities and community leaders we help st jude children overcome illness and triumph over disease giving them much needed hope to persevere
2688089 adam and stuart are both ranked among the top 50 players in the world and sean is making a big impact this year on the pga tour we still have two weeks before the commitment deadline and we already have one of the best fields weve ever had so we are very excited
2688090 help me find my way in life and i will build you a shrine
2688091 this is a fitting moment in the evolution of the growth of st jude
2688092 richard shadyac is a visionary an excellent planner and his focus his tenacity his dedication and his passion for st jude are unrelenting
2688093 i became an arkansas state trooper i married my high school sweetheart i have two wonderful children and three grandchildren
2688094 how proud he would be of all of you how proud he would be of his grandchildren singing out for alsac and how proud he would be of alsac the organization that was born in his heart and built on his faith fifty years later you are still the warriors slaying the dragons that would take children from their mothers and fathers
2688095 the metaphoric rock upon which alsac was built 50 years ago
2688096 the responsibility of alsac is herculean in scope to maintain the largest pediatric research center in the world like the inn keeper who was left with the guardianship of the suffering man we at alsac also stand guard
2688097 i cannot believe you are within 2 blocks of my home and i just now discovered you
2688098 bob bare epitomizes the commitment we all have for this great cause
2688099 we will do whatever we can to save these children
2688100 son go inside and up the stairs and tell mr thomas that we are ready
2688101 i was told to tell mr thomas they are ready for him
2688102 they are joining in a personal way in the lifetime dream of my husband danny thomas in doing so members are ensuring the hospitals growth and effectiveness its preeminence in the world of medicine and its stature as a symbol of hope for children in the world
2688103 in 1962 of all of you standing only this group seated would have survived acute lymphoblastic leukemia
2688104 our goal is not to get bigger but to get better
2688105 it was everything we could do to save the lives of the children stricken with cancer
2688106 i expected to see a regular hospital i was not expecting to see a wonder world we feel very humble to be a part of this
2688107 donating our estate to st jude was the best decision my husband and i have made
2688108 we are relieved to see our estate going to such a great cause
2688109 there is always something new it is a living organism and the need to be a part of it is contagious
2688110 we were down to the bare bones and the young guys have come in there stepped up and done a great job
2688111 it cost him a lot of pitches he had to throw extra
2688112 it makes it tougher but you know were talking about one or two plays you can work out of it it shouldnt make that much of a difference the added base hits on top of it an error is what wears you down and makes it a grind
2688113 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2688114 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain well see what it looks like today
2688115 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2688116 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2688117 there was nothing more than i wanted to do than play this first game and i guess when it came down to it walking out there it was a little bit overwhelming
2688118 but we got the jitters out of the way hopefully and we can follow the next games up with a little more solid defence
2688119 im hoping as the tournament goes on we will calm down and start thinking about the kind of game we can play
2688120 this being overwhelmed is a little too much in my mind even after a bad start it was 9 5 and we had a power play we couldnt execute if we execute that one maybe we dont win but it would be much closer
2688121 from there on we just gave up and thats not good this team does not give up that was one of our characteristics in the past we just have to get back to the same mentality we had before
2688122 five goals from the centre forward position even one is too much
2688123 it wasnt a question of winning or losing spain is one of the top three teams in the world it was a question of us
2688124 the whole theme is to play to our level and show the kind of talent we have and we didnt do that today
2688125 its not the pressure of playing at the olympics its all the distractions the excitement and everything that comes with it the families the media i think as a whole we didnt handle that very well
2688126 we could have been a helluva lot better spains a great team but to give up 16 goals is not acceptable
2688127 kara lang pulls up her socks literally and metaphorically perhaps
2688128 with the call from earlier today craig hummer and paul sherwin
2688129 yao will be playing and they love yao out here and they should its kind of like an official kickoff to everything
2688130 lets get in the mood of the olympics and playing china will be an amazing atmosphere and im looking forward to our team doing that
2688131 we have to do a good job of team rebounding but people are going to have to adjust to us because were fast
2688132 were very fast and were very strong and guys are going to have to face that because we can play defence
2688133 we might not be the tallest team but we will get the job done
2688134 with yao you play against the biggest man youre going to play against so that will be a challenge
2688135 i think when youre in a situation like this you do not try to over coach you have a simple game plan and let the guys feel the game and thats what were going to try to do
2688136 it hasnt changed countries have certain friends and friends help friends
2688137 on floor all people know kyle shewfelt theyre scared of him
2688138 if he makes final he can win competition thats why lots of people lots of judges from some countries gave him so low score
2688139 i looked at the score and i thought it was a little bit low
2688140 i think that the judges need to reward and recognize someone that pays attention to the smallest of details i think thats what makes gymnastics such a popular sport and so beautiful i fell in love with this sport in the early 90s because of the way the soviets did it
2688141 it is not so good for gymnastics if judges make decision not by result but by some kind of game
2688142 it is judges who were ugly ugly im very unhappy
2688143 but we came in and our subdivision was pretty tough
2688144 i dont know why im not sure what messages were sent to the panels in between sessions but i think were a better team than we ended up
2688145 i wanted to get 4 03 to be honest i didnt feel so great
2688146 i was in the ready room and i got like these cold chills
2688147 i was not that comfortable in the first 200 metres afterward i looked up and saw president bush giving me a thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2688148 i cant say that anything phelps does surprises me hes the tiger woods of swimming hes a superstar one of a kind but at the same time he makes everybody else better by going after him
2688149 i knew it was going to be a strong breaststroke when we all turned together at the wall then ryan turned dead even at the 200 metres so i knew i was going to have to overpower them
2688150 i was pretty happy with it the main thing was to get into the final
2688151 these finals are so tough to make and you really have to compete in the heats to be able to come back around and do it again in the finals is definitely a challenge
2688152 phelps was an all star hes the only one able to step up his game from the heats to the final and show how good he is
2688153 were pretty proud of ourselves were all rookies and it was our first final and thats two times our best time in a row so what more can you ask
2688154 he who has not climbed the great wall is not a real man
2688155 the heat and humidity were too much for me you feel your head explode
2688156 because sometimes your head does feel like it wants to pop
2688157 the climbs seemed to get steeper every lap you could see everybody was just empty on the last lap
2688158 well never be here at this moment ever again at the olympics doing this crazy race near the great wall so enjoy it while you can
2688159 this is my third year now and im getting better each day im making progress and feeling more and more comfortable each day so thats a part of the process feeling more comfortable ive just got a lot more improving to do and a lot more things to work on
2688160 its helped me a lot but we cant really tell yet because we havent played a real game
2688161 so the offseason work will show late in the season when i feel like im still healthy thats when the offseason work really plays a part
2688162 i want to go out there and be my best
2688163 i want to go out there and complete every pass make the right decisions its like home training throwing to one of my home teammates i want to be perfect i try to get my mind set
2688164 yeah i always had the confidence but just by going out there and doing it and getting more repetitions the more you do it the more and more confidence you get
2688165 i just wanted to come here healthy and work on getting my burst of quickness back and making sure im healthy enough to play 15 games
2688166 it really didnt matter to me honestly whether it was over or not
2688167 it didnt have anything to do with me really i was just preparing just trying to see what was going on
2688168 yeah i followed it because im a sports guy i love sports i watch sports all the time so it was just me watching just like everyone else
2688169 if he would have came in they would have brought him in for a reason and i understand that but it wasnt going to stop me from doing what i was set to do go out work hard and try to get better each day that was my focus and thats still my focus so it really didnt matter to me either way
2688170 it could have been a positive or a negative i could have learned a lot from him hes a great player
2688171 this is a completely different team than last year and i like the idea of them picking us where they have
2688172 this is more me than basketball basketball was a time in my life this is my roots basketball was a little drop in my life that is why it was so easy to turn the page
2688173 time is of the essence but were on the ice and in the game
2688174 there are still many details to be ironed out in terms of the fiscal commitments the province municipalities and federal government are making but that will move forward
2688175 if you want to be a cpa you have no choice and no time to waste
2688176 i dont know what happened too but i wish youd be humble enough to ask for help i am ready anytime
2688177 i may be strict but i dont bite my students
2688178 miss promise i studied for the quizzes but when i saw the questions
2688179 the ball hit him in the chest and hit the ground and everybody on the sideline kind of looked away
2688180 theres another cell in the area the players have been called off the range
2688181 no decision has been made on cancellation of play for today
2688182 i played a great first shot then a perfect 9 iron for 140 yards
2688183 it bounced in the front of the green but the wind blows just in the moment and it went down into the water
2688184 then again i had tried to make a good shot but again a lot of backspin again to the water and after that i got mad and played not very concentrated the whole rest of the round
2688185 i was almost fighting for the lead in the tournament and suddenly i was trying to make the cut

2688193 los georgianos han hecho una oferta de cese al fuego y es preocupante que los rusos no respondan a ella
2688194 est claro que los rusos buscan prolongar el conflicto de alguna manera porque ellos no dan garant as ni del cese de las hostilidades ni de la retirada de sus fuerzas

2688200 when vic gets back vic will be running second team
2688201 sams improving a lot and hell do a good job i like his intensity he still has a lot to learn hell play this year but i have a lot of confidence in vic as well
2688202 he just looks a lot better a lot more comfortable
2688203 hes always been a right side player you can tell when you put him over there his techniques better and that kind of stuff right tackles a natural position for him
2688204 hanging out at the barbershop all day thats the way i learned
2688205 im into a lot of fashion so i thought i would just have my own clothing line
2688206 with a clothing line youve got to have different options
2688207 so i try to make clothes everybody will like anytime i have free time im drawing up something that i like something different
2688208 oh yeah i have a lot of stuff on my agenda
2688209 i cant be bored i dont like sitting around so i just try a lot of stuff
2688210 this is my second year im more experienced im coming in ready knowing what i have to do last year i knew what i had to do but now im playing some teams that itll be my second time playing thats even better playing a team a second time you know what theyve got and you know what youve got to do to improve so thats what ive been working on
2688211 us on the right side thats probably the best you can get a lot of people are going to see that as soon as the season gets started
2688212 to tell you the truth i really dont worry about names or the nfl
2688213 football is football that person on the other side of the ball im going to do him like i do anybody else
2688214 i mean i caught the ball just like i catch it out here
2688215 my reaction to that is they need to focus on this season thats what im doing because im trying to get better im trying for the team to be the best techs ever been to do that my mind cant be wandering off somewhere else my minds got to be on my team and what weve got to do to get better
2688216 certain pass plays i knew i was in trouble because i knew i wasnt capable of throwing a 20 yard out if coach jon gruden called that play last year i wasnt able to manage it i was thinking of ways i was going to survive the game and at least move the team down the field somehow some way
2688217 i think it is another step but for some reason im not really as nervous for that as i was the first two days of practice
2688218 i feel like ive got my feet under me and ive definitely got my confidence back my timing and rhythm are back so i feel this will be easier
2688219 im sure ill be nervous but i think im more excited than anything right now
2688220 i cant think about it that way or i lose track of whats really going to go down he said im just going to focus on my part and however many drives i get just make the best of it
2688221 i got to do the two minute drill at the end of practice even doing the scout team stuff just getting out there and throwing

2688273 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2688274 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2688275 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2688276 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2688277 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2688278 if youre a person who tends to suffer you will suffer as an actor even if you are doing a comedy

2688280 i am closer to this character than to the psychopath chigurh in no country for old men thank god but that doesnt mean i am this guy
2688281 the joy of the actor is to find the characters inside of you because we are holding all of them if you are not holding him inside of you you better run man and find him
2688282 you have to understand him there are as many different ways to do it as there are actors in the world what i like to do is start from the inside feelings not from the outside behaviors
2688283 he was making bold choices and when youre working with someone whos doing that you cant touch him you just have to stand back and let it happen

2688288 in the world of independent film a lot of performances get noticed and praised but often its because the director can only afford to shoot master shots and everybody is good in a master shot

2688330 these results are bad news for gordon brown three times as many people would be more likely rather than less likely to vote labour if gordon brown was not leader
2688331 if they are to have any hope of wooing the electorate then a change at the top may restore their fortunes but it is no magic bullet if labour chose a new leader he or she would have to work very hard to gain the publics confidence it would not come automatically

2688346 for me whats paramount is writing from a truthful place
2688347 now im finding this extreme sense of urgency to cut to the core to get to the truth it strikes me that theres a real lack of protest songwriters out there what a real opportunity this is to write about what all of us are feeling collectively to serve the role artists have served historically
2688348 a wholly inspired creative environment for me a very prolific time
2688349 not to sound too harsh but with this record im not concerned who im going to lose or pick up
2688350 because everything felt more urgent the environment a war based on deception and in general across the board people in america have become comatose or dulled out by the immense amount of information thats out there i had to take a leap of faith that a lot of people are feeling the way im feeling

2688365 jan is al 22 jaar mijn buurjongen ik ken hem al zijn hele leven naast visboer ben ik ook voetbal en schaatstrainer en zodoende sporten jan en ik geregeld samen laatst waren we aan het skeeleren toen ik hem vroeg of het klopte dat zijn stemgeluid wat hoger was geworden de laatste tijd dat klopt bevestigde hij waarop ik beweerde dat hij toch vast nog niet zo hoog kon zingen als ik bij thuiskomst vertelde jan dat aan yolanthe die spontaan riep dat ze me zou komen helpen in mijn kraam als ik jan zou verslaan en zo geschiedde
2688366 ze konden er wel om lachen yolanthe wilde graag komen helpen en jan komt gezellig mee inmiddels hebben we de planning zover dat ze f de 23e f de 30e naar raamsdonksveer komen daar sta ik op zaterdag altijd met mijn viskraam de precieze datum hangt af van de agenda van jan

2688421 i wont spend 5 99 on people but im dying to know what the photos look like please tell me
2688422 shed love brad to see photos of her holding her own baby
2688423 i desperately need someone to try this home perm out on
2688424 nagging suspicion that perhaps i was not the person best suited to the task
2688425 open up and make more interesting the definition of the short story
2688426 give yourself a nice cussion of cash and retirement income
2688427 personally i save about 10 each month for retirement 20 as liquid cash for everyday needs and another 40 for investing this may sound very demanding especially with regard to las vegas nevada politics investments but in actuality it is really a reflection of what you want for your future not necessarily what you want now
2688428 were looking at the long term here quick wins are for lotteries and penny poker games not the las vegas nevada politics investment market i think given enough time those who invest in this area will see good returns for their las vegas nevada politics money
2688429 we want all of this to be simple and risk to be nominal the main area in which people have difficutly is assessing their wealth and risk factors far too often we see las vegas nevada politics investors jumping into a portfolio that is far too aggressive the end result can be disasterous invoking many to file bankruptcy
2688430 the motivation to have money from a las vegas nevada politics portfolio in the future is great
2688431 but dont forget that you cant live in the future forever many people fall into the trap of not meeting basic needs in the present which logically means that their future will become progressively more difficult
2688432 make las vegas nevada politics investments work for you and retire wealthy
2688433 my top tip is making baby steps before giant leaps
2688434 by starting slowly your risk factor is greatly diminished and financial commitment is much lower you can get out at any time with minimal losses or move forward into more risky las vegas nevada politics areas with good fundamental knowledge
2688435 i invest heavily in areas that look promising but also proportionately balance my risk by putting some money in standard investments such as stocks bonds and money market funds
2688436 its like having a cucumber sandwich in a rose garden
2688437 i have a big reluctance to talk about anything that might later be misconstrued i was not worried before but since the internet every time you do an interview 300 other people are going to take that story and turn it into something else
2688438 i wish i could be more relaxed and funnier in interviews but i cant because i always regret it afterwards
2688439 all the characters are suffering and struggling so much and to me it was a drama
2688440 woody managed to make all of us forget that we were doing a comedy and when i saw the movie with an audience in cannes i wondered why they were laughing so much i laughed when i read the script and i did not laugh again until i saw the movie
2688441 i wanted to be able to work in other places not just in my country so i learned english late and when i was 23 i got my first movie in english hi lo country with stephen frears and i learned my lines phonetically
2688442 i didnt have any command of the language and it was very painful because i didnt know what people were saying
2688443 i have worked in four different languages french italian english and spanish and its a lot of work but i know i have to keep studying because as well as hollywood my heart needs to keep working in my country and also in other places in europe
2688444 ive never fallen in love with someone im working with its always been afterwards if something becomes friendship then maybe months later it becomes something else but you can never know its always a mystery you cant plan those things
2688445 im blocking the possibility of rain happening out of my mind
2688446 torontos got an incredible music scene especially in the whole indie hipster world right now toronto is known across the world as one of the hottest cities musically
2688447 the concept is to take a snapshot of what we think is relevant at this point in time what we think is cool and where the scene is thats what were trying to showcase
2688448 its a beautiful venue but also its a good size its intimate
2688449 too human has been a project that has been really near and dear to silicon knights heart for an extremely long time we first conceptualized it in 1993 now there are all these kind of rumours that weve been working on it for that long and that is definitely not true
2688450 but its almost company defining for us in many ways we believe in it we love it and you know getting it done i can only describe it as shock right now it hasnt sunk in ask me four months from now
2688451 i think one of the cool things is that if you dont know a lot about norse mythology the characters are developed on their own so you dont have to have that back story if you have it its a little bit richer for you
2688452 they keep telling him youre too human for this you need to alter yourself and basically theyre trying to get you to give up your humanity for this power thats the core underlying story
2688453 we realize that people arent going to go hmm my humanity has been contemplated its got to be fun
2688454 people still have to pick up the controller and go aah argh ooh aah
2688455 clearly they are a high quality developer clearly its an eagerly anticipated game but i just dont know itll sell its million units i just dont know if its going to sell five

2688457 project funding is provided for artists to produce new work whats missing are capital grants for builds moves and purchases
2688458 has an obligation to centres like lift to protect them in the face of developers instead the developer created a vanity building for expensive businesses catering to a particular moneyed class
2688459 that 15 million could have gone to the ontario arts council and supported the dozens and dozens of arts organizations they support
2688460 right now there is no capital project of any kind within the ministry we are working on a modest program we hope to see that come to fruition in the coming years of our mandate
2688461 ik wil niet positief of negatief zijn maar er zijn verschillende bedrijven ge nteresseerd in val saint lambert
2688462 fifteen ltte terrorists were killed when the army made a daring advance this morning before first light and without sustaining any damage to our own troops the ministry said
2688463 two civilians including a school teacher were killed four more civilians were injured when the sri lanka air force bombed iranaipalai the tigers said
2688464 up until this point weve basically been in work groups
2688465 we were in work groups today after this scrimmage we have to start giving guys a role weve got to find where they can help
2688466 i was really expecting her to say fellow finalist twitch boss i knew that a lot of people loved twitch
2688467 i heard it right away so i was like oh my god
2688468 hes like my brother and its a big day for hip hop
2688469 inspirational for all of the kids that cant afford dance classes its exactly what id want the country to see
2688470 but only in the summer because i was also into sports for me it was sports more than dance i ran track and i was a varsity running back
2688471 i took modern class i took some ballet classes i took jazz classes i wanted to know what everything was i didnt want to go into the competition and be dumbfounded
2688472 then we got this and we were like god how are we going to pull this off
2688473 but we did good i thought we really had fun with it
2688474 with this team particularly with the number of young players that we have who may be able to contribute were going to have to work these two early season scrimmages and make evaluations a little bit more like when you cut your team in the nfl
2688475 sometimes you dont keep all the best players because some younger players might be not quite as good as a veteran player at the time but you have to make a decision to invest your time and certain guys might be able to develop and make you a better team over time
2688476 some great receivers who came in i feel like they can produce immediately everyone has to step their game up if they want to be out there and bring their a game
2688477 the game is competition you need competition if you bring competition to the team you make the team better
2688478 were still looking for some big time guys some playmakers to step up but for the most part were doing a good job at the wideout spot
2688479 between me and the receivers we have a lot of trust theyre a great group and they work hard theyre going to be really solid this year
2688480 its not just game experience but its the reps the timing you know what hes going to do with his route before he does it
2688481 he turned it over twice today once during the two minute near the end
2688482 but i think he has done a better job with good decisions throughout this camp just like i felt he made tremendous progress making business decisions when he has a bad day now its not always a bad judgment he had one the other night that was a tipped ball thats not his fault necessarily
2688483 hes made better decisions if he continues to make good decisions were going to make big plays and minimize the bad plays and were making progress in that regard
2688484 mir hacia arriba y vi al presidente bush agitando la bandera y asintiendo con la cabeza eso fue genial me hizo sentir muy bien
2688485 phelps estuvo sorprendente marc un r cord mundial no se puede pedir m s fue un gran comienzo para estados unidos
2688486 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2688487 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2688488 this is definitely necessary for preventing arms shipments to georgia by sea
2688489 a sea blockade of georgia will also help avert an escalation of military activity in abkhazia
2688490 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2688491 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2688492 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2688493 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2688494 interested at first but after smelling it was frightened amp ran away
2688495 best temporary measure to extricate the country from its worst situation
2688496 we would like to sit where we dont have to worry about people behind us dropping their peanut shells on us
2688497 if you have no urgent need to stay in georgia you should leave as soon as possible
2688498 it is wise to do so while some air services are still available and the border remains open
2688499 serious fighting continues in the conflict zone of south ossetia
2688500 as an expression of good will and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2688501 ein effekt ist nur berechtigt wenn er den inhalt unterst tzt
2688502 is to help create provide and improve for american schools and their children more quality opportunities to be active healthy and fit
2688503 the board of education felt it wanted to help the district with taxes
2688504 what we lost seriously outweighs what weve added and will have an impact on the district throughout the year
2688505 with rising energy costs and limited state aid the district will probably be focusing on what to eliminate in the next years budget instead of how it can improve
2688506 f r mich l uft es von spiel zu spiel immer besser die ersten partien waren wirklich hart aber heute gegen angola habe ich mich richtig gef hlt ich musste mich an das neue system gew hnen aber jetzt freue mich auf die n chsten aufgaben die werden schwer genug
2688507 es war schon sehr merkw rdig morgens um elf uhr hier aufzulaufen daher war ich auch sehr berrascht gleich so eine begeisterung zu erleben ich denke wir d rfen uns alle auf ein wirklich tolles turnier freuen
2688508 chris hat heute ein nahezu perfektes spiel abgeliefert stark unter dem korb beweglich und auch sicher aus der halbdistanz dazu sind der welt nicht viele spieler in der lage
2688509 chris hat mit seiner gr e das spiel nat rlich extrem dominiert und den gegner sofort eingesch chtert zusammen mit dirk gibt er der ganzen mannschaft so viel selbstvertrauen dass wir die n chsten deutlich schwereren aufgaben jetzt mit viel selbstvertrauen angehen k nnen
2688510 es gibt in der welt keine ausgemachtete dummheit als dieserart alles auf das ma unsres erkenntnis und urteilsverm gens zurechtzustutzen
2688511 warum verdr ngen wir wieviel widerspr che sich in unseren eigenen urteilen finden selbst berhebung und neugierde sind die beiden gei eln unserer seele diese treibt uns unsre nase in alles zu stecken und jene verwehrt uns irgend etwas unentschieden uud auf sich beruhn zu lassen
2688512 i was the one who suggested give herbie a kick
2688513 i feel very very bad about it i had no idea and campo gave me the evil eyes when he walked into the dressing shed
2688514 theres not a real lot to say theres a lot to feel about it
2688515 we all played a part in it attitude thats probably a big part of it
2688516 we talked about having a defensive focus at half time
2688517 if we have got 17 men out there that are willing to work hard for each other and theyre focused on what they need to do then you can get a result and certainly things clicked today
2688518 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2688519 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2688520 this is definitely necessary for preventing arms shipments to georgia by sea
2688521 a sea blockade of georgia will also help avert an escalation of military activity in abkhazia
2688522 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2688523 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2688524 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2688525 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2688526 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2688527 the surge has succeeded yet commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2688528 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2688529 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2688530 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance but could still be squandered by hasty withdrawals or arbitrary timelines
2688531 a doctors follow up communications with a patient though not exactly marketing are all part of a customer feedback loop that can help keep a patient and her family informed to make better choices about continuing care
2688532 nearly all of the organizations 850 physicians communicate with patients online physicians respond to 97 percent of the queries by or before the next day
2688533 first and foremost this is to take better care of patients
2688534 it saves a patient in person visits it leaves a record for patients to access and it indirectly improves access to a physician
2688535 once patients realized the benefits of e visits group health cooperative promoted the initiative in advertisements
2688536 but group health patients wont find any ads popping up in the clinical messages they receive from physicians there is no spamming no promotional messages to patients through our electronic medical records dr handley said

2688541 its an honor to compete with other swimmers here it is also an honor for me to gain the medal in the olympic games
2688542 it is a good result and thanks for the support of our people i have tried my best
2688543 i know im swimming well i wasnt far off the pace
2688544 i didnt quite have the petrol in the tank for that second 200
2688545 i feel as if i have got a better swim in me but i did everything i could i will be a bit more ready to go when the 1 500 comes around
2688546 i believe that the position of the international community supported by australia is that georgia is an independent state its territorial sovereignty should be respected and therefore all states should exercise restraint and that includes the russian federation
2688547 its important for the united nations security council to deal with this matter its regrettable that in the session which has been held on georgia theyve been unable to reach an agreed resolution on action
2688548 but for our part in australia and i think in common voice with the rest of the international community we are calling upon all parties to exercise restraint and for the territorial integrity of the sovereign state to be respected
2688549 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
2688550 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan
2688551 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province
2688552 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12 people
2688553 ive been running this race since i was 13 years old
2688554 third was my best coming into today and to win it is a dream come true for me
2688555 im really excited to win it was my second time running it competitively
2688556 i wanted to run the first 10km hard i didnt want to leave it until the final 4km because its pretty easy from there
2688557 i started running when i was at school so it would be 50 or 60 years
2688558 ran away from the teachers to wag and hide and ive never stopped
2688559 this year i was just happy to make it over the finish line
2688560 last year i was waiting at the finish with a bandana on my head and no hair

2688599 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic sea ice
2688600 the crucial point is that ice is clearly not building up enough over winter to restore cover and that when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years
2688601 through a common friend general durrani i had advised president musharraf to resign two months back but the president gave no reply

2688603 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2688604 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2688605 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2688606 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2688607 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2688608 how could we in the third millennium be dealing with the levels of syphilis that are out there in this province with this amount of money
2688609 this province doesnt know what to do with health so they keep shifting everything around hoping it will all work and this time out i think theyve impaired the ability of the public health section to do their job
2688610 they say theyre working on it and theyll be releasing it any time now and then nothing
2688611 theyre there to govern they have to put the best strategies in place for public health
2688612 the nature of his injuries were such that in spite of their efforts his life could not be saved

2688615 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2688618 what if we could dip into the energy of those lost versions in some way to enable us to live our chosen life with more vigour wouldnt that be interesting
2688619 that sort of bargain never works out in the end for the recipient you buy back that kind of balance and something huge will drop off the other end of your account theres no such thing as a free lunch as they say
2688620 i just feel that theres a huge well of energy building in me my lifes about to split a big change is coming and i want to make sure its going to finally place me on the path i want to take in the world maybe the energy of such a huge fork means that you get both halves to keep with you
2688621 carlos you have more than enough energy to take you though any decision you seek to make in life
2688622 just make sure you dont make the mistake of thinking that life changing decisions are in some way revocable you take one step down a chosen road theres no going back you retrace the path youre on a brand new road that while it might look like youre walking back towards a recognisable place in fact takes you somewhere different and unknown
2688623 though i fear perhaps that i may already have made a similar mistake
2688624 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2688625 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2688685 amp now i amp bilal went on harboring a lesson for him we thought about cornering him at a weak point he had every body at hostel was much peeved of this particular habit
2688686 not only his roommates but all of us were troubled with that raucous curse and as per our plan we needed a speaker mike amp an electric connection oh dont tell me chuckled moon breathlessly almost getting the nub of the plan how genius and then laughed uncle at that night when he was enjoying his sound sleep we sneaked into his room placed the mike before him took the speaker to the common room amp inserted the plug of speaker into the socket moon was laughing like anything now amp no sooner had we switched it on than the hostel was raging with rowdy snores but our breakneck sprint back to the room didnt let any one see us there and a couple of moments later weve to come back to the common room pretending to be drowsy yawning amp murmuring as though wed been awoken by the dratted snores of somebody whole hostel was echoing with the thundering voices that were not sounding snores at all the doors were opening one by one letting sleepy boys out apprehension laden eyes x raying the surroundings even he woke up by his own thundering snores amp ran out to the common room amp all guys whod worked out the whole matter my word every body started whacking him with cushions amp pillows amp even some fetched their slippers to the scene without thinking how could he put mike before him while sleeping bilal ahead of them all moon could not help another fit of hysteric giggles but we didnt stayed there to make this point clear to the sleepy boys so fleeing away from the scene we dozed off happily amp nobody could ever get we were the culprits however he himself kept throwing us with his contemptuous cum suspicious looks but lacking any solid proof hindered him doing anything against us cool moon tried to stop her giggles so you guys were too dangerous werent you uncle agreed yeah amp smiled meaningfully even then not a fraction of what you guys are we could never have done the thing with ants what you did with frogs oh leave it now moon stopped giggling amp chewing completely whats embarrassing dear his smile broadened it was great i mean im not saying that result was but surely the idea uncle please moon said uncomfortably it was all sarahs if you like it than go to her she keeps bursting with such ideas and uncle chuckled like moon did a couple of minutes ago at that moment the only door of the room opened letting in a smart benign lady surprisingly resembling the former inhabitants of the room with two mugs in her hands she was wearing a thick fur coat amp a wooly cap oh its too cold outside she handed a mug over to uncle sitting on the floor bed beside moon amp placing her feet before fire amp rubbing her hands together why he interrogated you werent in your bed oh no she said taking the cap off her dark black hair in the kitchen ah my feet are all numb oh maa i wouldve been all free tomorrow its weekend ive told you moon came near her id have done the dishes its ok honey she ran her cold fingers through moons hair but now i guess time to go to your bed see its 9 30 amp you got to wake up early for prayers

2688689 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this recognition the awards are a powerful acknowledgement of our ongoing growth in the business travel sector and the premium services we provide our customers vlm airlines is dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and is continually striving to set new standards in the airline industry
2688690 despite good fundamentals we have been unable to insulate ourselves from sector developments indeed the second quarter was clearly weaker than the previous year the latter part of the year also seems difficult and the operational result for the second half of the year might dip into the red
2688691 high fuel prices and a trend towards lower ticket prices have been unsettling developments for airlines the overcapacity in the market has not allowed ticket prices to rise in parallel with costs the coming cost cutting programmes in the sector will be so severe that in countries where airlines collapse there may be demands for flight connections to be maintained for business needs using state funds
2688692 the situation in the sector may remain extremely difficult due to expensive fuel and uncertain development of demand in the second half of the year fuel costs are expected to account for around 28 per cent of finnairs turnover whereas last year the jet fuel bill accounted for a fifth of turnover
2688693 in punctuality we are again among the best of european airlines moreover the amount of baggage delays has also fallen to a third of last summers total

2688745 were just trying to go out and have some fun in these last few games
2688746 the past few summers ive had bad games toward the end so it was a goal of mine to end the season strong and keep playing well
2688747 as we got deeper into the game we thought we had a good chance of getting this thing done but we wish behnkes all the luck

2688749 the corrugated metal pipes and concrete pipes that run underneath i 94 are in bad shape
2688750 theyre cracked and broken so what were doing is rebuilding the sewers without digging em up
2688751 were running a saturated polyester resin tube inside the old pipe filling it up with water and expanding it to the diameter of the inside of the old pipe and curing it with hot water were basically building a new pipe inside the old pipe
2688752 and in about five hours we can install it cure it cool it down and cut the ends off and theyll have a brand new pipe which is wear resistant its jointless so it should last our lifetime

2688790 this is a wrong way to go to sauna this is not about relaxing this is competition
2688791 marketers see social media as opportunity and never seem to consider it will be the snake that bites them
2688792 brands are living organic things because all the time those with knowledge of a brand are changing they may grow richer or poorer and will certainly grow older and as the perceiver changes so inevitably does the perception if a marketing company closes both its eyes and its ears if it relies on the single dimension of current sales if it believes that yesterdays successful strategy is an infallible guide to tomorrows profit then its heading for disillusionment of barometric severity
2688793 lets put forward a reformulation a brand is a collective perception in the minds of consumers but how does this help resolve the division between brands in the head and brands on the balance sheet because by making it a collective perception we can turn a brand from an opinion into a type of fact
2688794 communication is going on here but its not verbal communication its communication with other bits of the brain mirror neurons are firing all sorts of things are happening but its not about a single clear message
2688795 the average marketing big idea is big enough to give you a year or so of ok communications its normally summed up in a tagline and some kind of visual consistency its simple and clear its useful because it lets you integrate all kinds of stuff from all kinds of suppliers and its explicable to the salesforce so far so ok
2688796 the challenge of the semantic web therefore is to provide a language that expresses both data and rules for reasoning about the data and that allows rules from any existing knowledge representation system to be exported onto the web
2688797 we give up the illusion of our power as deriving from some notion of individual collecting data and find out that having access to data through our network enabled communities gives us an entirely more living flow of information that is appropriate to the ever changing circumstances surrounding us instead of growing high we grow wide we become pancake people
2688798 most of the defenders of current culture dont even try to explain why it was ok that the printing press destroyed scribal production but not ok that the internet threatens newsprint or why a proliferation of new creators and experimentation with new forms was good in 1508 but bad in 2008
2688799 mad men a simpler time of real men real problems and lots of sex on mid century design classics its real success in adland was down to a wistful longing for a time when clients were actually clients in other words the people that ran and had often founded the business being advertised and simply wanted to sell more of their products by any means necessary of course the arrival of professional marketing departments has changed the relationships that agencies have with client organisations and the roles that they play for them but it hasnt change the need for clear business objectives

2688923 i have been playing pogo now for 2 years and have had a wonderful time meeting people from all over the world it is great fun and i am so glad that i found pogo
2688924 im a 24 year old graphic designer from northern vermont i design and lay out childrens books and put my heart and soul into making them fun and easy to understand for all levels of reading
2688925 i am a 24 year old i live in a small town in ohio i have been married to my wonderful husband for three years we have three beautiful children who are 7 5 2

2688929 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook
2688930 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
2688931 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
2688932 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
2688933 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
2688934 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran and to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
2688935 i do believe that the bible is banned under the plain language of this new statute
2688936 row is not between jammu hindus and kashmiri muslims as branded by some section of the media but rather a fight of nationalist forces against separatist elements
2688937 you can see hindus sikhs and even muslims out on roads to support the movement
2688938 its a movement of four lakh kashmiri pandits who are bearing the brunt of being refugees in their own country for over 19 years and its a movement of every indian who consider jammu and kashmir as integral part of india
2688939 this public outcry is to throw out each and every separatist out of this country so that people of jammu and kashmir and rest of india could shun fear forever and live in peace and tranquillity
2688940 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2688941 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2688942 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2688943 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2688944 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2688945 all peaceful avenues have been exhausted to resolve the conflict
2688946 we are now compelled to resort to the application of proportionate and justifiable force so that peace and order may be restored in north cotabato
2688947 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2688948 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2688949 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2688950 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2688951 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2688952 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2688953 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2688954 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2688955 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2688956 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2688957 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2688958 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2688959 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2688960 the concept had been on the table for some years now all countries have finally agreed on the formation and implementation of the saarc food bank
2688961 properly realised it would serve as a milestone in strengthening the existing cooperation among the nations of south asia
2688962 this involves the construction of new food warehouses in member countries local procurement and the international purchase of extra food grains and developing an administrative system and a distribution network so it is likely that it will take some time before operationalising the saarc food bank
2688963 i am twenty years old and am in college right now to be a preschool teacher i love kids have always babysat and would love to work with infants
2688964 goldie loves everyone and all other dogs and yes even cats i only wish i was as always as good natured and happy as she is

2689008 i wanted to go for the record but i wasnt sure if i should but then in the warm up room i kind of got these chills in my body and started getting excited
2689009 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2689010 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2689011 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation
2689012 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
2689013 give lasting effect to the values which are considered fundamental by the people of the united kingdom
2689014 we want to see a bill of rights that would set the bar for the universal standards to which everyone is entitled and fills the gaps in the protection of more vulnerable people such as the elderly children or people with learning disabilities
2689015 it should not be some sort of charter for correct behaviour that would see rights as a reward for fulfilling social responsibilities rather it should be aspirational setting out a shared vision for the future of our society
2689016 the lawbreakers drove a taxi to the local public security office industry and business administration and other sites and tossed homemade explosives destroying two police vehicles
2689017 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2689018 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2689019 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2689020 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2689021 ever since high school i always eat pasta the night before a game
2689022 it was hard to pass up ive been in the nba 10 years it was time to try something different
2689023 if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks
2689024 any discussions between james and olympiakos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
2689025 its the ultimate goal ive been trying for since ive been 5 years old
2689026 we have what it takes to medal and to win
2689027 hopefully on the day that it counts it will be there
2689028 its a credit to her and a credit to coach armstrong the way he brought her back from the accident
2689029 people around the world are becoming healthier wealthier better educated more peaceful more connected and they are living longer
2689030 world poverty will be cut in half between 2000 and 2015 which is arguably one of the greatest triumphs in human history
2689031 i think the first offense did a good job against the second defense scored a lot of points and had a lot of big plays
2689032 im not really sure how many points the second offense scored but the first defense has got to play better for the second offense to be that effective against our first defense thats not good
2689033 its the first time ive seen aaron johns on this football field look like he may be a difference maker
2689034 it was big to see we could stretch the field
2689035 i think we ran the ball better today because of it
2689036 i think we just need to go back to the drawing board reassess what we did watch the film and clean things up
2689037 im still excited about whats going to come with our defense
2689038 i think my biggest concern without looking at the film has still got to be up front defensively
2689039 how can we hold up and how can we do better than what we did last year it didnt look like we were effective stopping the run
2689040 hes a well polished opponent and i beat him by more than 10 points
2689041 its going to be tough all the way but ill stick it out
2689042 im in a tough draw but ill battle it out and do the best i can
2689043 it was a mature performance from the youngest member of our team a tremendous performance
2689044 it will do a lot to lend credibility and respectability to purdues program here
2689045 we take a real back seat in this area to u of l and kentucky and indiana
2689046 my team members were a little nervous and some players lost the opportunity to score
2689047 therefore we have to resolve the problem in the shooting circle so that we convert opportunities
2689048 the main issue is how to make the best of the opportunities within the shooting circle many of them got the opportunity we also have to make sure that the senior players are kept fresh
2689049 wanneer men er nu naar kijkt was de video een beetje helderder dan de echte opnames
2689050 maar de meeste toeschouwers dachten wel dat het echt was daarmee heeft ons werk zijn doel bereikt
2689051 op het einde merkte ik dat ik volledig uitgeput was
2689052 de boot zette zich meteen dwars en op minder dan twee minuten tijd zonk de achterkant
2689053 ik wisselde rechts met links af en als ik moe werd zwom ik op mijn rug
2689054 ik had de kracht niet meer om te lopen maar ik mocht niet opgeven
2689055 we dachten aan onze vrouwen en kinderen we wilden vooral niet inslapen
2689056 i tried to find my mom but i couldnt find her
2689057 this is a true testament to the importance you place on relations with china
2689058 most ambitious olympics in history opens with most spectacular show
2689059 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2689060 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2689061 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2689062 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me

2689067 i have advised the president to choose a dignified exit and resign to save the country from further polarization
2689068 if he did not quit than its obvious i will vote in favor of his impeachment
2689069 i could have given up at the start but that wouldnt have been fair on the team so now i just have to sit and wait
2689070 they were not the best routines but thats what happened at the end of the day thats all i can do
2689071 this event which celebrates our success in the e gaming photographic images field also serves as a good break for our hard working staff
2689072 and we find that employee morale is greatly improved after a celebratory occasion and bonuses are handed out

2689086 os melhores e alguns dos piores textos de branco leone
2689087 eis aqui raba as da mercearia s o pedro como que se escrevem di logos
2689088 aquele acorde o furado sobre o banquinho com pintas roxas estava hil rio
2689089 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2689090 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2689091 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2689092 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2689093 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2689094 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2689095 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2689096 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2689097 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2689098 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2689099 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2689100 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2689101 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2689102 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2689103 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2689104 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2689105 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2689106 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2689107 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2689108 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2689109 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2689110 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2689111 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2689112 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2689113 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2689114 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2689115 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2689116 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2689117 people will have to travel to workington or use the telephone and that might put them off seeking work
2689118 if they had somebody in town i believe that would help them find a career
2689119 it is the same as everything else going to computers
2689120 they are doing away with jobs left right and centre
2689121 not everybody has a computer and the means to get to workington if people are out of work they cant afford the prices for motor cars
2689122 i have heard from social workers and meals on wheels workers in cumbria some on only 39p per mile who are now as volunteers making a huge loss in trying to deliver meals on wheels or social services that cannot continue
2689123 an area such as cumbria has a lot more people with cars and they are not the newer flashier models but older cars
2689124 we have a low paid rural population who do not have access to buses they just aint there
2689125 we get into our cars and drive the 30 miles to the nearest train station and then we use the trains
2689126 those lower paid workers will generally have older model cars and they are in danger of being clobbered because of the governments changes on vehicle excise duty
2689127 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2689128 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2689129 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2689130 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2689131 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2689132 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2689133 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2689134 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2689135 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2689136 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2689137 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2689138 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2689139 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2689140 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2689141 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2689142 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2689143 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2689144 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2689145 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2689146 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2689147 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2689148 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2689149 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2689150 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2689151 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2689152 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2689153 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2689154 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2689155 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2689156 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2689157 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2689158 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2689159 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2689160 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2689161 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2689162 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2689163 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2689164 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2689165 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2689166 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2689167 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2689168 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2689169 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2689170 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2689171 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2689172 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2689173 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2689174 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2689175 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2689176 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2689177 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2689178 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2689179 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2689180 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2689181 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2689182 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2689183 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2689184 just so you all know we did set a record
2689185 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2689186 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2689187 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2689188 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2689189 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2689190 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2689191 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2689192 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2689193 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2689194 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2689195 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2689196 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2689197 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2689198 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2689199 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2689200 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2689201 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2689202 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2689203 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2689204 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2689205 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2689206 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2689207 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2689208 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2689209 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2689210 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2689211 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2689212 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2689213 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2689214 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2689215 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2689216 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2689217 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2689218 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2689219 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2689220 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2689221 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2689222 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2689223 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2689224 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2689225 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2689226 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2689227 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2689228 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2689229 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2689230 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2689231 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2689232 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2689233 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2689234 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2689235 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2689236 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2689237 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2689238 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2689239 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2689240 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2689241 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2689242 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2689243 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2689244 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2689245 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2689246 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2689247 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2689248 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2689249 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2689250 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2689251 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2689252 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2689253 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2689254 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2689255 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2689256 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2689257 real results by the end of my first term in office
2689258 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2689259 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2689260 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2689261 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2689262 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2689263 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2689264 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2689265 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2689266 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2689267 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2689268 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2689269 mccain did not have a great week his visual was riding around in a golf cart with old george bush the first
2689270 shears report represents a major change in the mainstream press culture of the past sixteen years
2689271 he genuinely likes reporters hell joke with us about our drinking habits playfully request our cell phones in the middle of a call and tell some unsuspecting editor or parent that the phones owner has just been hauled off to rehab and engage in gleefully sarcastic banter about both our colleagues and his
2689272 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2689273 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2689274 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2689275 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2689276 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2689277 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2689278 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2689279 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2689280 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2689281 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2689282 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2689283 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2689284 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2689285 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2689286 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2689287 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2689288 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2689289 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2689290 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2689291 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2689292 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2689293 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2689294 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2689295 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2689296 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2689297 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2689298 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2689299 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2689300 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2689301 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2689302 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2689303 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2689304 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2689305 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2689306 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2689307 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2689308 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2689309 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2689310 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2689311 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
2689312 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
2689313 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
2689314 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2689315 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2689316 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2689317 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2689318 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2689319 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2689320 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2689321 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2689322 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2689323 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2689324 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2689325 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2689326 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2689327 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2689328 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2689329 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2689330 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2689331 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2689332 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2689333 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2689334 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2689335 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2689336 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2689337 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2689338 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2689339 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2689340 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2689341 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2689342 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2689343 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2689344 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2689345 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2689346 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2689347 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2689348 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2689349 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2689350 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2689351 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2689352 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2689353 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2689354 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2689355 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2689356 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2689357 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2689358 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2689359 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2689360 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2689361 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2689362 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2689363 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2689364 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2689365 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2689366 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2689367 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2689368 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2689369 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2689370 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2689371 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2689372 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2689373 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2689374 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2689375 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2689376 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2689377 it is our job to clarify any confusion and misunderstanding
2689378 whatever decisions orders and policies handed down by the courts and the legal department we have to abide by them they should understand the countrys legal system
2689379 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2689380 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2689381 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2689382 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2689383 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2689384 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2689385 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2689386 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2689387 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2689388 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2689389 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2689390 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2689391 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2689392 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2689393 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2689394 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2689395 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2689396 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
2689397 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
2689398 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
2689399 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
2689400 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
2689401 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
2689402 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2689403 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2689404 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2689405 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2689406 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2689407 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2689408 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2689409 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2689410 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2689411 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2689412 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2689413 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2689414 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2689415 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2689416 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2689417 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2689418 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2689419 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2689420 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2689421 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2689422 considering there is documented proof that the side effects of fluoridation include asthma arthritis gastric disorders fluorosis in teeth particularly in one third of young children skin rashes and thyroid dysfunction surely the residents of mount gambier and the community at large have a right to have their concerns heard

2689440 as for bobby weve done two films together before id do anything for the deols banner vijeta films any time
2689441 it is bobbys film but ive a substantial role i am the shoulder he cries on sometimes its good to be a shoulder instead of shouldering a film
2689442 we shot the episode from 1 a m to 4 a m i had a tough time keeping my eyes open but salman entertained us all through he played a double role he was both the host and the hero of one of the films i was promoting
2689443 when did i ever say i had any problems with salman we make a fantastic on screen pair we proved it in mujhse shaadi karoge and now again in god tussi great ho we rock together amitji amitabh bachchan plays god by the way as for salman hes always fun on the sets
2689444 it may be exhausting to play 36 holes youre putting that much mental effort and everything into it its rough
2689445 we mowed all of the roughs wednesday and the plan was to look at it see how it was coping and growing
2689446 we considered cutting the rough again friday and we did in fact do so in the fairway landing areas last night
2689447 a lot of my friends are sardarjis im very fond of them for their lifestyle and daring ive never done a film that would hurt any communitys feelings quite frequently i get rid of potentially funny scenes when i feel theyre offensive i want to distribute love not hatred through my cinema
2689448 i personally approached major sikh communities to watch singh is kinng they pointed out scenes that were not quite right we recalled akshay kumar from south africa and re shot those scenes then the sikhs were quite happy
2689449 our intentions cannot be doubted people who saw the film on wednesday say singh is kinng is better than my no entry and welcome my wife thinks this is my best work to date and my children love it thats a relief if people in my home dont like a film how can i expect people outside to like it
2689450 ill say only one thing ive made a very good film its a much bigger film than my no entry and welcome but i wasnt thinking of those films while making singh is kinng i didnt want to repeat the earlier formula for the first time ive incorporated action scenes in my cinema i dont like action but because of akshay we had to include it
2689451 i go before the release of all my films and spend four five days in ajmer sharif im able to overcome my nervousness there
2689452 i dont make four films a year i make one film every two years so ive no immediate project to fall back on ive put my entire life in singh is kinng
2689453 vipul loves and respects me thats why he approached me id love to do another film with him if vipul didnt have confidence in me why would he let me direct hed have done it himself
2689454 i normally shoot one film at a time its because of my producer vipuls planning that i could complete and release singh is kinng eight months after my last release welcome

2689470 because of rapid economic growth in india increased demand for business process outsourcing to india and increased competition for skilled employees in india wages for comparably skilled employees in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the us and europe which may reduce this competitive advantage

2689508 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2689509 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2689510 as an expression of good will and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2689511 the navy was ordered not to allow supplies of weapons and military hardware into georgia by sea
2689512 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2689513 something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation
2689514 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2689515 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2689516 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2689517 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognized borders and urges russia to respect them
2689518 going to meet the principals basically to update them on the progress so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2689519 caprioli rock stelvio mestrovich il comune di pisciotta nellambito dellestate pisciottana organizza a caprioli sul lungomare capo darena il festival di musica
2689520 fair enough that is completely up to them its their decision
2689521 that was an unbelievable tournament and after that brazil game everyone was talking about a football revolution about how new zealand football had finally woken up for the first time since 82 the world cup finals but we didnt kick on
2689522 if we can just hold on for that first 20 25 minutes and weather the storm then find our legs brazil like china will get three or four really good chances and it just depends if they take one of them
2689523 este voto del pueblo boliviano va a ser para fortalecer la democracia y para redefinir el escenario pol tico el voto nos obligar a un reencuentro de autoridades a la reconciliaci n del pueblo boliviano
2689524 ser un d a hist rico algo in dito por primera vez el pueblo boliviano tiene derecho a revocar o a reelegir a sus autoridades
2689525 el voto del pueblo va a tener mucha importancia porque al margen de ratificar o revocar autoridades ser la expresi n de definiciones pol ticas

2689527 vamos a exigir que se inicie la investigaci n al magistrado federico sosto por violentar la obligaci n de la imparcialidad y que se determine si lo hizo o no
2689528 estamos llamando al di logo y esperamos que la corte tome la decisi n en cuanto a los puntos que planteamos
2689529 en muchas otras ocasiones he dado colaboraci n en estos t rminos
2689530 lo que la corte vaya a disponer pues ya yo no lo sabr a es hasta el lunes ma ana que se resuelve este tema
2689531 llegamos a la conclusi n de que ser muy dif cil si no imposible lograr algo en com n para hacer una declaraci n
2689532 rusia ha utilizado los bombarderos m s potentes del arsenal a reo ruso y ha lanzado ataques con misiles bal sticos en territorio georgiano
2689533 but in the near term at least we would consider him an enemy combatant and still a danger and would likely still be detained for some period of time thereafter
2689534 but i think you know there are still a significant population within guantanamo who will likely never be released because of the threat they pose to the world for that matter
2689535 si se quiere hacer un suero antiof dico eficaz tiene que tener veneno de ambas poblaciones
2689536 dada la importancia de esta especie en los envenenamientos que ocurren en centroam rica el conocimiento tan detallado de su veneno es fundamental para comprender mejor sus acciones adem s el trabajo realizado brinda informaci n muy valiosa para el dise o de las mezclas de veneno que se requieren para la producci n de antivenenos o sueros antiof dicos
2689537 a n estamos a tiempo de salvar tan cuantiosa inversi n
2689538 estoy muy contento fue una carrera muy emotiva sab a que iba a ser muy dura en toda su extensi n
2689539 iba muy pareja en los 200 metros no estaba muy c modo con que estuvi ramos tan cerca tan entrada la carrera as que estir un poco m s mis brazadas en el pecho y en ese punto el libre ya es una bajada pura adrenalina
2689540 fue algo muy bonito tener al presidente en las tribunas
2689541 lleg m s de un a o despu s de perder peso sin raz n aparente con una desnutrici n severa e irreversible la causa era que no com a su familia dec a que era normal
2689542 hay familias que piensan que cumplen con solo comprarle el diario los v veres pero no saben que ese diario debe ajustarse a las necesidades nutricionales de sus pap s
2689543 una se ora de 85 a os con desnutrici n severa siempre ven a acompa ada por su hija a retirar la leche que le daba el hospital
2689544 pasaron los meses y la se ora segu a igual de flaca nunca hablaba hasta que un d a su misma hija confes que usaba a su mam para retirar la leche que luego daba a sus hijos
2689545 tenemos que generar conciencia en las familias y sensibilizar al personal m dico para que no subestime este problema
2689546 de esa cifra se cancelaron 1 033 millones por incapacidades temporales 219 millones por incapacidades permanentes y 192 millones por muerte
2689547 los otros 2 870 millones corresponden a la inversi n en atenci n m dica hospitalaria medicamentos y otros
2689548 entre las seis de la tarde y las seis de la ma ana
2689549 estamos trabajando en la aver a y el pron stico es que la situaci n podr a volver a la normalidad esta noche
2689550 escuchamos en las noticias el aviso de aya y recogimos agua en baldes para el d a
2689551 un gran logro de esta conferencia es el aspecto central de los derechos humanos
2689552 por primera vez en estos congresos se habl de los transg nero trabajadoras sexuales y hombres que tienen sexo con otros hombres
2689553 tambi n se habl de los ni os y discapacitados que viven con vih los ind genas o usuarios de drogas intravenosas
2689554 hasta que no comprendamos este proceso no se conseguir una vacuna
2689555 su norma era que si no era miembro de la junta directiva no se involucraba
2689556 no constru a casas para millonarios sino para clase media porque cre a que la gente debe vivir dignamente
2689557 por lo menos despu s nos llevaba a comer pescado del reventaz n
2689558 fui a ver sub el cuarto est en una segunda planta ten a la puerta entreabierta y mir que estaba desnudo pens que algo malo hab a pasado y llamamos a la cruz roja y a la polic a
2689559 sencillamente no comulga alarc n con las ideas del plan de trabajo que tenemos es muy profesional pero conflictivo las ideas de mercadeo que tiene son diferentes a las de la empresa
2689560 posiblemente la otra semana vamos a dar a conocer el nombre de la persona estamos evaluando varios candidatos
2689561 lo m s que cruzamos don jorge y yo en este tiempo fueron 18 palabras si no me conoce no s c mo puede concluir que soy conflictivo
2689562 la tienda que ten amos estaba al garete y eso no debe ser as
2689563 estamos valorando la posibilidad de traer refuerzos para la planilla administrativa pero no creo que se vaya nadie m s pienso que con la salida de alarc n se culmin en ese aspecto la verdad es que ya tenemos a alguien
2689564 le hemos cancelado al 90 por ciento de los acreedores hab amos propuesto un plan de pago de dos a os pero estamos adelantados debo decir que las deudas del herediano eran por 1 500 millones
2689565 lo que pasa es que estamos valorando si sale m s barato construir o remodelar es una opci n que manejamos y que decidiremos en los pr ximos d as
2689566 se est trabajando en lo que son las curvas de nivel los planos y cimientos estamos analizando qu queremos de la estructura
2689567 fue una etapa muy extensa nunca hab a corrido una tan larga y fue bastante dif cil
2689568 me deja como lecci n que hay que prepararse mejor y me queda la espinita de volver en mejores condiciones y en un mejor nivel
2689569 tras la prueba me queda la impresi n de que en costa rica tenemos buen ciclismo lo que falta es afinar algunos detalles para poder ser competitivos a este nivel
2689570 brenes envi al mec nico y esa fue la mejor decisi n si albin estuviera aqu no hubiese sido mucha la diferencia adem s robert hizo un buen trabajo al igual que muchos de la delegaci n tica que vinieron a apoyarme
2689571 entonces al final se determin que no era necesaria tanta gente y que atletas como gabriela tra a kristopher moitland y allan segura lo mejor era que se quedaran descansando para sus pruebas y que entrenadores y equipo administrativo fueran lo que le di ramos asistencia a raabe
2689572 s mbolo de una fe valiente que avanza hacia lo desconocido aunque es vulnerable
2689573 un aspecto positivo es que hay un comit local de bandera azul ecol gica en jac con l deres como do a sonia alvarado vigilantes de la playa el comit logr bandera azul para su comunidad y deben seguir trabajando y denunciado la contaminaci n de la playa
2689574 sin embargo estas medidas aunque importantes son parches porque el verdadero problema solo se soluciona con la construcci n de un sistema de alcantarillado sanitario para jac
2689575 estas medidas son realmente eficaces siempre y cuando se realicen con apoyo de la acci n ciudadana de nada vale tener grandes torres en la playa estilo miami si un desarrollo desordenado termina contaminando la playa el mayor patrimonio para el turismo no son los enormes edificios sino la calidad la playa
2689576 cualquier mejor a es beneficiosa sin embargo sino se construye un alcantarillado sanitario en tamarindo cualquier resultado podr a estar pegado como un papel con saliva en la pared
2689577 dichosamente existe el programa bandera azul ecol gica que agrupa a comunidades conscientes del valor de sus playas y dispuestas a vigilar y denunciar al programa a quienes contaminan sus valiosos recursos
2689578 its very appropriate that it an inconvenient truth got an oscar from the land of make believe
2689579 when you have your skin hanging off your leg and you cant walk and you cant get in the shower competing in beijing is not the first thing on your mind
2689580 you go from being in the best shape of your life to not being able to brush your teeth on your own its a big transition going from elite athlete to getting disabled parking
2689581 every day i laid in bed and i imagined myself competing at the olympics and today i did and it was beautiful
2689582 i did exactly the job that i wanted to do
2689583 im just gushing with happiness and joy and pride theres tears but these are tears of excitement this is something that ive worked for for 20 years of my life the past 11 months for me have been hard its been the biggest challenge of my life
2689584 ive had to search for small victories every single day i mean you dont get that from winning an olympic medal and i know that its not the final moment that defines a person its everything that you have to go through in the journey towards getting there
2689585 its just a victory in so many ways just to endure what he went through and be able to deliver a world class performance regardless of what the result was thats not an excuse its truly an amazing feat to be able to do that
2689586 i did everything i could i took pills for it i pumped it full of freezing
2689587 on a pain scale of one to 10 if 10 is unbearable he was probably close to eight or nine on every landing
2689588 its just hard to see a kid like that whos worked his whole life have this opportunity taken away from him when he had the potential to really challenge for a podium position
2689589 i know i dont look 26 but im 26 and your body starts to tell you
2689590 im on a missionary journey to become the best version of myself
2689591 i really want to feel that im in a very balanced and good place in my life and i do feel that but i think its always important to learn and draw little bits of inspiration from wherever we can
2689592 it hasnt changed countries have certain friends and friends help friends
2689593 on floor all people know kyle shewfelt theyre scared of him
2689594 if he makes final he can win competition thats why lots of people lots of judges from some countries gave him so low score
2689595 i looked at the score and i thought it was a little bit low
2689596 i think that the judges need to reward and recognize someone that pays attention to the smallest of details i think thats what makes gymnastics such a popular sport and so beautiful i fell in love with this sport in the early 90s because of the way the soviets did it
2689597 it is not so good for gymnastics if judges make decision not by result but by some kind of game
2689598 it is judges who were ugly ugly im very unhappy
2689599 but we came in and our subdivision was pretty tough
2689600 i dont know why im not sure what messages were sent to the panels in between sessions but i think were a better team than we ended up
2689601 i have worked too hard to lose on something like that so it has to go
2689602 the purpose of the evening is to introduce new varieties of bedding plants to home gardeners and members of the local nursery and greenhouse industry
2689603 we are growing them in our environment to monitor how well they perform
2689604 oh yeah do they censor right thinking posts over in boltsville
2689605 thusfar however no one has answered the question as to how the un disposed of the medieval warm period
2689606 that graph recently condemned by the us national academy of sciences as having a validation skill not significantly different from zero i e as being useless
2689607 with respect to methods the committee is showing reservations concerning the methodology of mann et al
2689608 the ensuing debate in the scientific literature continues even as this report goes to press
2689609 notes explicitly that the method has no validation ce skill significantly different from zero
2689610 some recent results reported in table 1s of wahld and ammann in press indicate that their reconstruction which uses the same procedure and full set of proxies used by mann et al 1999 gives ce values ranging from 0 103 to 0 215 depending on how far back in time the reconstruction is carried
2689611 condemned by the us national academy of sciences as having a validation skill not significantly different from zero
2689612 the basic conclusion of mann et al 1998 1999 was that the late 20th century warmth in the northern hemisphere was unprecedented during at least the last 1 000 years this conclusion has subsequently been supported by an array of evidence that includes
2689613 based on the analyses presented in the original papers by mann et al
2689614 the 1990s are likely the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year in at least a millennium
2689615 with respect to methods the committee is showing reservations concerning the methodology of mann et al the committee notes explicitly on pages 91 and 111 that the method has no validation ce skill significantly different from zero
2689616 the committee notes explicitly on pages 91 and 111 that the method has no validation ce skill significantly different from zero
2689617 nya nya you have an underlying lack of faith nya nya nya
2689618 either god is everywhere or he is nowhere but he is certainly not limiting his appearance in the universe to the bacterial flagellum and the blood clotting system
2689619 there was nothing more than i wanted to do than play this first game and i guess when it came down to it walking out there it was a little bit overwhelming
2689620 but we got the jitters out of the way hopefully and we can follow the next games up with a little more solid defence
2689621 im hoping as the tournament goes on we will calm down and start thinking about the kind of game we can play
2689622 this being overwhelmed is a little too much in my mind even after a bad start it was 9 5 and we had a power play we couldnt execute if we execute that one maybe we dont win but it would be much closer
2689623 from there on we just gave up and thats not good this team does not give up that was one of our characteristics in the past we just have to get back to the same mentality we had before
2689624 five goals from the centre forward position even one is too much
2689625 it wasnt a question of winning or losing spain is one of the top three teams in the world it was a question of us
2689626 the whole theme is to play to our level and show the kind of talent we have and we didnt do that today
2689627 its not the pressure of playing at the olympics its all the distractions the excitement and everything that comes with it the families the media i think as a whole we didnt handle that very well
2689628 we could have been a helluva lot better spains a great team but to give up 16 goals is not acceptable
2689629 they believe as a sports ambassador athletes expand leadership skills through sports as well as develop a connection to other cultures and peoples utilizing foreign travel experiences
2689630 it was truly an unbelievable spectacle which involved over 3 000 athletes from 20 different countries
2689631 the clinicians were professional athletes who gave speeches at the welcome dinner ceremony among the advice imparted were caring about people trying your hardest practice doesnt make perfect it makes permanent every day is a gift and preparing properly can take away pressure
2689632 the bowlers started their day off with one hour of classroom time with team usa head coach jeri edwards who instructed the bowlers in the physical and mental game i was proud to coach one of our senior boys from california 16 year old erik buckalew who won the gold medal defeating chris standel of england 247 209 the fans were roaring and applauding it was an awesome feeling for all of us
2689633 i enjoyed watching the children interact with the athletes from other countries and learning other cultures they exhibited so much interest in the foreign athletes on the last day of competition the athletes traded with each other their shirts they had actually worn in competition it was cool to see one of our bowlers wearing a shirt from malta or england they also traded other gifts as a show of good will that was specific to the area in the us from where they hailed it was really a great moment of fun athleticism and just children being children
2689634 to me one of the funniest moments i witnessed was when we took our u
2689635 lets just say some of those kids should have held off on their lunch until after that ride
2689636 not only coach the bowlers but also perform bed checks help with any money issues i e exchange or call home for more contact family back in the states tend to illnesses and injuries and chaperone them on all the tours
2689637 i was in doping control and they said hurry up because president bush is waiting for you
2689638 that kind of surreal experience can only happen to you at the olympics
2689639 everywhere we have gone we have been treated so very well
2689640 ive played her before so i knew what to expect
2689641 i struggled with the wind and conditions in the hall and it was difficult finding my rhythm
2689642 as an activist i think i probably made my legacy because now women are competing in trap and skeet
2689643 i think this increased the opportunities for women and participation of women hopefully that will go on for generations
2689644 as long as you have your passion age does not matter
2689645 an elderly woman answers she gets a prize and were on to the next question this time the team has to guess the country the m c reads the clues
2689646 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2689647 maybe thats why it hurts so much it hit so close
2689648 as a forward you get frustrated when you dont get the chances and these last two games ive had plenty
2689649 obviously youd like the ball to go in the back of the net a little bit more but it happens and to get one is fantastic
2689650 i think theres a good chance the four points is enough to advance but i dont have the brain to calculate that at this time
2689651 and it was eye opening to our team to see that because its going to be like this more and more as we progress through the tournament and we just have to look forward and block it out if its getting to us and just play through it
2689652 we got a little bogged down a little distracted we just need to loosen up and get all the olympic stuff off our shoulders when we do that we race faster and care free
2689653 i think one of the benefits of being an athlete in the village is that you get all the distractions out of the way while youre there
2689654 weve been really sheltered here which has been a benefit today i think both scott and i got on the water and there were too many olympic distractions
2689655 we probably could have raced a bit better but we still advanced straight to the semis and dont have to race the repechage in two days
2689656 the olympics is going to hit you at some point
2689657 i think the first five strokes werent brilliant and that kind of rattled them a little bit
2689658 im at that really bad hair stage where its too short to wear in a ponytail and too long to hang loose because i cant see so im wearing it like a 13 year old girl half up and half down im running out of clips got any extra
2689659 the humidity factor makes you sweat so much you lose water and eventually it saps you
2689660 by the end of a match that exhaustion can make you sloppy
2689661 to be honest i thought that might happen because like at a regular tournament not all the guys invited show up
2689662 we really should be insisting they wear their team gear
2689663 i am not satisfied i find the horse a bit tense and he finds every flower pot terrifying
2689664 saw flashes of fire and heard sporadic gunshots after the explosions
2689665 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2689666 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2689667 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2689668 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2689669 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2689670 its good for the world to have girls playing softball and these women are going to show young girls how to win
2689671 time is of the essence but were on the ice and in the game
2689672 there are still many details to be ironed out in terms of the fiscal commitments the province municipalities and federal government are making but that will move forward
2689673 i wanted to get 4 03 to be honest i didnt feel so great
2689674 i was in the ready room and i got like these cold chills
2689675 i was not that comfortable in the first 200 metres afterward i looked up and saw president bush giving me a thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2689676 i cant say that anything phelps does surprises me hes the tiger woods of swimming hes a superstar one of a kind but at the same time he makes everybody else better by going after him
2689677 i knew it was going to be a strong breaststroke when we all turned together at the wall then ryan turned dead even at the 200 metres so i knew i was going to have to overpower them
2689678 i was pretty happy with it the main thing was to get into the final
2689679 these finals are so tough to make and you really have to compete in the heats to be able to come back around and do it again in the finals is definitely a challenge
2689680 phelps was an all star hes the only one able to step up his game from the heats to the final and show how good he is
2689681 were pretty proud of ourselves were all rookies and it was our first final and thats two times our best time in a row so what more can you ask
2689682 el gobierno quiere evitar que la fiesta nacional se convierta en otro escenario m s en el que la oposici n busque violencia
2689683 hoy d a est n ante un escenario de derrota anticipada de una derrota abrumadora frente a ello no atinan a usar a emplear otra herramienta m s que la violencia la intimidaci n el chantaje el silenciamiento de la opini n p blica
2689684 este es un montaje de golpe de estado al t pico estilo de las dictaduras
2689685 va a ser muy dif cil si no imposible encontrar puntos de coincidencia suficientes para elaborar una declaraci n conjunta
2689686 estamos realmente preocupados ante la idea de que las hostilidades y el conflicto en si se extiendan de lleno en abjazia
2689687 el secretario general est alarmado por la escalada de las hostilidades en georgia que ha dejado grandes cantidades de v ctimas y una destrucci n masiva en osetia del sur y otras regiones de georgia
2689688 profundamente preocupado por las crecientes tensiones en la zona abjasia incluidos los bombardeos de la parte superior del valle kodori
2689689 los georgianos han hecho una oferta de cese al fuego y es preocupante que los rusos no respondan a ella
2689690 est claro que los rusos buscan prolongar el conflicto de alguna manera porque ellos no dan garant as ni del cese de las hostilidades ni de la retirada de sus fuerzas
2689691 ah je me disais profitant de sa soudaine mise en lumi re son avocat en rajoute estimant en des phrases toutes faites que
2689692 si ce n gre est lu je lassassinerai moi m me
2689693 in coming weeks the hsc examinations will also begin for drama music and language students as they undertake the practical component of their exams acting education minister john hatzistergos said
2689694 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2689695 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2689696 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2689697 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2689698 het faillissement is op verzoek van een belastingsadviseur aangevraagd die werkzaamheden voor kwakoe events heeft verricht en niet is uitbetaald
2689699 go to each of your vendors every 6 9 months and ask for 10 30 off if half of them say yes youll save 5 15 on fixed costs people will give you a discount if they think they are going to lose the business
2689700 the determination of probable cause during preliminary investigation or reinvestigation is recognized as an executive function exclusively of the prosecutor thus the determination of the persons to be prosecuted rests primarily with the prosecutor who is vested with discretion in the discharge of this function
2689701 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd
2689702 but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
2689703 told us that they had no active weapons of mass destruction program
2689704 the going in assumption was that we were going to war so this nie was to be written with that in mind
2689705 reported that production of chemical and biological weapons was taking place
2689706 gave those of us at the most senior level further confidence that our information about saddams wmd programmes was correct
2689707 in modo tale da riprendere quello che c intorno a noi
2689708 dream no small dreams for they have no power to move the hearts of men
2689709 productivity is not the squeezing of the rag but rather productivity is the belief that theres an infinite capacity to improve anything
2689710 who wants small anything really i am sick of miniaturisation centralisation minimalism mini skirts narrow mindedness tiny train seats and thongs down with downsizing life is too big this season i say lets wear big skirts high heels huge hats and enormous jewels listen to music at full volume drink long vodkas dance all night long have long holidays and ride around on humungous dogs
2689711 be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind
2689712 the abstract artist receives his inspiration not from any piece of nature you please but from nature as a whole from its most multifarious manifestations which accumulate in him and lead to the work of art
2689713 i only sing for pleasure and love all music and writing as long as it has soul regardless of genres thats why i have participated in different projects from electro pop to trip hop or folk and the more i live the more i believe that the simple things and feelings are the most beautiful music with soul music with truth personal intimate storytelling music music which also lives in silences
2689714 intuition is a method of feeling ones way intellectually into the inner heart of a thing in order to locate what is unique and inexpressible in it if there is a way of grasping a reality in absolute rather than in relative terms of entering into it rather than taking up positions on it of comprehending it without translation or symbolism then that way is metaphysics itself
2689715 its always about the journey its a sense of discovery that were talking about here
2689716 the world is full of poetry the air is living with its spirit and the waves dance to the music of its melodies and sparkle in its brightness
2689717 follow your own path because it will bring you to the places you were meant to be
2689718 hope is like a road in the country there wasnt ever a road but when many people walk on it the road comes into existence
2689719 listening is a magnetic and strange thing a creative force the friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward when we are listened to it creates us makes us unfold and expand
2689720 if you dont design your own life plan chances are youll fall into someone elses plan and guess what they may have planned for you not much
2689721 a great metaphor is when people say that theyre burned out
2689722 because when youre overworked your acid levels go through the roof
2689723 but there is one area that we do have control over what we eat
2689724 it is the balance of these foods that is important
2689725 being too acidic promotes the development of chronic illnesses viruses and bacteria which thrive in this setting
2689726 why not it will be a good market test and i can take advantage of that knowledge to further improve other marketing
2689727 while honoring the past and its gilded history the grey swan recognizes our responsibility for conserving energy and our natural resources we initially started by inviting guests to reuse towels and charging bed linens every3 days or as needed rather than daily we also let our guests know that we will recycle any plastics glass aluminum or paper that is left int heir rooms we have recently been participating in a community effort to establish a recycling center in the the town becoming green is an ongoing education process for us reviewing our current practices and the willingness to change as we can to become better stewards for our property community and world
2689728 equally treated compensated and honored as a free will living being

2689749 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2689750 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

2689762 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2689763 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2689764 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2689765 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2689766 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2689767 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2689768 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2689769 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2689773 wir hatten heute eine auto zum gewinnen doch die vielen gelbphasen kamen immer genau im falschen moment und haben ewig lange gedauert ich war deutlich schneller als der sieger david brabham doch wenn man st ndig hinter dem pacecar f hrt kann man keine positionen gutmachen
2689774 unsere strategie die effizienz unseres motors gegen ber der konkurrenz auszuspielen w re unter normalen umst nden voll aufgegangen doch heute hatten wir ganz einfach zu viel pech
2689775 nach dem restart zwei runden vor rennende war ich zweiter mika war sich mit seinem bereits berrundeten teamkollegen nicht ganz einig diese einladung habe ich genutzt und bin innen vorbei gegangen
2689776 das hat dazu gef hrt dass er einen fehler gemacht hat und ich ihn passieren konnte
2689777 under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2689778 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us
2689779 in one air strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
2689780 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside
2689781 a woman begged the firemen and soldiers to help find her family she said shed gone into the burning apartment block but had not been able to find them
2689782 we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings we saw at least one man pulled out dead
2689783 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2689784 ossettia is georgias territory it has been undermined by terrorists funded by moscow
2689785 this is because russia wants to punish georgia for its democratic stance and its western ties at the moment there are between several hundred and two thousand people dead this conflict is not ethnic its not religious its about russia wanting georgia to be subordinate to them
2689786 it is vital for leaders on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2689787 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2689788 in order to consider withdrawal of our forces we must make sure that there is no chance of genocide there
2689789 there is a straightforward way to stop fighting to stop killing for georgians to withdraw and then to have an agreement on non use of force signed and then we can talk on other verity things including on military and political arrangements
2689790 certain georgian military activity which is supported from outside of south ossetia
2689791 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2689792 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2689793 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2689794 maybe it will be quiet in the future im an optimist
2689795 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2689796 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2689797 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2689798 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2689799 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2689800 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2689801 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years
2689802 georgias actions are criminal whereas russias actions are absolutely legitimate
2689803 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are obviously a crime it is a crime against its own people first and foremost
2689804 a deadly blow has been struck on the territorial integrity of georgia itself which implies huge damage to its state structure
2689805 the aggression has resulted in numerous victims including those among civilians and has virtually led to a humanitarian catastrophe
2689806 time will pass and the people of georgia will give their objective estimations to the actions of the incumbent administration
2689807 it is based on an attempt of the georgian administration to get other countries involved in its bloody affairs
2689808 in accordance with international agreements including the agreement of 1999 russia does not only execute peacemaking functions but is obliged in case one party breaks the cease fire agreement to defend the other party which is exactly what we are doing in case with south ossetia
2689809 we perfectly realize what world we live in today we will strive for fair and peaceful solutions of all conflicting situations which we inherited from the past
