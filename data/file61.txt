610000 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
610001 a grand salon a throwback to new york of old
610002 ask the average guy if he knows or has heard of rubin chances are he has but not rattner
610003 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
610004 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
610005 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
610006 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
610007 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
610008 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
610009 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
610010 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
610011 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
610012 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
610013 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
610014 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
610015 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
610016 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
610017 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
610018 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
610019 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
610020 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
610021 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
610022 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
610023 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
610024 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
610025 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
610026 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
610027 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
610028 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
610029 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
610030 it was made into a bad movie in the 1970s starring the admirable george c scott
610031 but i have always been convinced that theres a great movie in this book and this is the one we are going to make
610032 i said from the start if we got the boat right then the rest would fit into place it has to go from being a fishing boat in the first half of the film to a war vessel in the second half it was vital to me that it was genuinely built before the second world war so the hunt was on from the moment we got the go ahead for the movie
610033 its a 38ft american motor cabin cruiser a wooden hull 11 ft beam 3 ft draught a perfect match to the boat hemingway described
610034 it used to have a four cylinder flathead chrysler diesel engine but someone replaced it with a v8 general motors gasoline car engine it turned the boat into a virtual bomb it looked like a bucket of rusty bolts so i sent some guys to move it to a good boatyard
610035 it was 12 knots on a boat which was not seaworthy after a nine hour journey we navigated in by torchlight to the new yard
610036 we will then take her to an undisclosed location and protect her like an unborn child
610037 but it means that you will see 27m of the 32m on the screen there are certain things that are meant to be and if youre lucky enough in life to eventually get there then that is a great achievement this is the project that is meant to be for me
610038 i put a lot of myself in to those roles
610039 in the valley of elah was an important film because we were looking at how the iraq war impacts on local communities across america with the loss of family members its a tragedy that carries on
610040 he is so focused tommy never wants to waste time and sometimes we were having a bit too much fun for him
610041 my belief is that we should never waste a day
610042 and when you are working and acting is our work there should be total concentration on what you are trying to achieve anything less than that then you are cheating yourself and short changing others
610043 in the end i didnt think i could make it as a professional sportsman so i thought that acting could make a great alternative life
610044 its still sport of a kind with winners and losers you also have to be fit to survive its not that first or second part or even big role which is so difficult its maintaining it over years
610045 no im a private person i hate everything about this business that intrudes on my life including these interviews but i do them to promote the movies because it helps people im fond of
610046 there is a terrific battle between an 11 year old boy and a 1 000lb blue marlin which i am looking forward to filming that is when the boat comes into its own
610047 this movie might be set in the past but it is about you and me now
610048 it is not a chick flick not a thriller killer not a quirky romance
610049 i want it to be a really good movie exciting from minute to minute frame to frame this is for people who want to see something different
610050 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
610051 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
610052 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
610053 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
610054 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
610055 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
610056 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
610057 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
610058 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
610059 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
610060 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
610061 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
610062 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
610063 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
610064 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
610065 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
610066 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
610067 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
610068 there is not much that evangelicals have in common with the policies promoted by barack obama
610069 despite his best efforts to court people of faith voters understand the difference between lip service and public service and john mccains record is much more in line with the values of the evangelical community
610070 one thing that it clearly is indicative of this poll is that this nation cares about the christian values and ethics of a candidate for national office and it makes enough difference that the news media reports on it
610071 people of faith have always been involved in the political process they have a patriotic and scriptural obligation to do so it is to be ignored at the candidates peril
610072 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
610073 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
610074 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
610075 unix ms dos and windows nt also known as the good the bad and the ugly
610076 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
610077 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
610078 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
610079 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
610080 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
610081 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
610082 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
610083 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
610084 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
610085 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
610086 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
610087 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
610088 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
610089 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
610090 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
610091 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
610092 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
610093 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
610094 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
610095 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
610096 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
610097 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
610098 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
610099 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
610100 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
610101 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
610102 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
610103 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
610104 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
610105 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
610106 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
610107 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
610108 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
610109 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
610110 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
610111 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
610112 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
610113 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
610114 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
610115 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
610116 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
610117 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
610118 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
610119 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
610120 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
610121 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
610122 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
610123 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
610124 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
610125 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
610126 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
610127 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
610128 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
610129 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
610130 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
610131 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
610132 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
610133 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
610134 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
610135 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
610136 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
610137 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
610138 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
610139 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
610140 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
610141 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
610142 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
610143 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
610144 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
610145 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
610146 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
610147 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
610148 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
610149 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
610150 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
610151 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
610152 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
610153 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
610154 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
610155 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
610156 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
610157 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
610158 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
610159 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
610160 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
610161 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
610162 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
610163 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
610164 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
610165 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
610166 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
610167 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
610168 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
610169 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
610170 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
610171 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
610172 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
610173 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
610174 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
610175 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
610176 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
610177 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
610178 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
610179 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
610180 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
610181 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
610182 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
610183 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
610184 surfings lost chapter how did daytona beach become floridas 1st surf city
610185 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
610186 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
610187 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
610188 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
610189 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
610190 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
610191 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
610192 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
610193 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
610194 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
610195 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
610196 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
610197 in the western countries you will not get this kind of services i know my rights okay
610198 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
610199 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
610200 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
610201 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
610202 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
610203 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
610204 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
610205 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
610206 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
610207 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
610208 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
610209 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
610210 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
610211 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
610212 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
610213 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
610214 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
610215 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
610216 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
610217 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
610218 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
610219 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
610220 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
610221 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
610222 this location is wonderful and the massive volunteer effort and energy is amazing
610223 what makes us really unique is while the other stations in the top 10 have paid staff were an entirely volunteer based organization
610224 we all have other jobs im a professor at hobart and william smith we have nurses chemists people who work for kodak several of us are working scientists who use data we collect here
610225 we have visitors from all over the world who stop at the banding station i believe very strongly in educating and training banders so they understand what theyre doing and why
610226 this is one of the best places to get training as a bird bander
610227 by noting the fat storage we learn a lot about the energetics of migration how much fat they need to continue on
610228 the birds stop here along the lake shore to fuel up before crossing or to refuel after theyve come south across the lake weve done habitat surveys so we know a lot about what kind of foods they need
610229 they will insist on organizing the olympics in august during vacation too bad because i wont be watching
610230 let them take all the pills they want and well see where that gets them
610231 are you prepared to put your hand on your heart and say all the medals won by your country since the war are legitimate
610232 much of the revenue derived from b c bud as the cannabis crop is known goes on paying college fees perhaps buying a second car or making that holiday to the caribbean just a little bit more affordable
610233 the trade is so large that the police in b c are faced with an impossible task
610234 it certainly is enough to tide people over no problem
610235 and two lights are not going to get you into trouble either
610236 this is a black and dark day for the residents of this province
610237 we are already reeling under the onus of paying the highest light bills in the country
610238 the clark kent of regulatory utility agencies very mild mannered the board should have sent the corporation back to clean up its act but instead grants a very ample rate increase
610239 to see dartmouth retain its small city flavour and stay as a city by itself not as part of a larger region
610240 i want to see dartmouth remain dartmouth a close knit city of wonderful people
610241 one of the finest seaside properties currently available in nova scotia
610242 what a national theatre festival like this can do for an area is encourage local groups to perform and even write their own plays
610243 ballads to snappy tunes from slower gay gordons to fast reels and jigs and from irish accordion tunes to a sentimental song trip around scotland
610244 i want that title and i dont see why i cant get it i believe in myself and im going to do it
610245 it turns out that carrots and sticks in german is sweetbread and whips which i thought was a little more evocative
610246 that was a little cultural lesson sweetbread and whips i thought man were in berlin
610247 the whole sort of siren thing the cyclops thats interesting
610248 i think part of what makes the odyssey enduring is everybody can relate to going on a journey and the trials and tribulations of trying to get back home
610249 anytime i make a stop sasha gets snow globes and malia gets key chains
610250 i was not well organized enough to personally think of what presents to give these guys
610251 hopefully should i end up being president i can put my touch on the present thing but i didnt even know it was a custom to give presents other than state visits
610252 should we be successful that actually the most important thing you need to do is have big chunks of time during the day when all youre doing is thinking
610253 has not broadened confidence in his ability to be commander of the u s military
610254 suggested obamas trip may have helped energize voters who favour mccain
610255 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
610256 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
610257 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
610258 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
610259 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
610260 c program files common files microsoft shared office10 mso dll
610261 c program files common files microsoft shared office10 mso dll
610262 doing them both i could do it in one trip i could save gas that way
610263 how can you tell a person what they can do on their own time
610264 what im trying to do is raise the subject and sort of inspire some discussion about this
610265 they wanted to do it and i said yes come on out here and set it up id be really happy to volunteer there are tons of deer here
610266 we can no longer sit by and hope it goes away on its own
610267 it will not so we need to know how to protect ourselves and how to deal with the illness if we should contract it
610268 there were buckets and cans around i think we surprised them
610269 we each thought the other had been doing something with the extra containers and didnt realize at the time what was taking place it was in broad daylight
610270 to be used as an institution for carrying on their work and assist in suppressing other evils
610271 so far as we are concerned we would willingly consent that the women should assume the government of the world for the next hundred years and that all mankind should submit to be protected and controlled by such laws as they should in their wisdom enact the self styled lords of the creation have tried their hands at the business long enough in all conscience they have governed the world for about six centuries and a precious business they have made of it the women could do no worse and we shrewdly suspect they could do a great deal better there is a natural love of order about women that if carried as it assuredly would be into all the arrangements of government could not fail to be productive of the happiest results
610272 first the bearing and bringing up of children second the creating of home and the beautifying of home life third to charm men and make the world pleasant sweet and agreeable to live in fourth to be kindly and loving to be sweet and to be cherished to be weak and confiding to be protected and to be the object of mans devotion
610273 to be used as an institution for carrying on their work and assist in suppressing other evils
610274 girls do not oh do not be suffragettes dont be masculine women
610275 fannie and freddies sprawling lobbying machine hired family and friends of politicians in their efforts to quickly sideline any regulations that might slow their growth or invite greater oversight of their business practices
610276 likewise there was another set of entities essentially a huge industry that profits from every additional loan that fannie or freddie can buy
610277 the more loans they purchase the more business there is for them and so theyre willing to work with the enterprises
610278 it seems to me weve seen enough evidence over the years that the capitalist system is not going to be destroyed by an outside challenger like communism
610279 it will be destroyed by its own internal greed greed is the greatest danger as we develop an increasingly winner take all system
610280 its dispiriting indeed to watch the u s financial system supposedly the envy of the world being taken to its knees
610281 but thats the show were watching brought to you by somnambulant regulators greedy bank executives and incompetent corporate directors this wasnt the way the ownership society was supposed to work
610282 youre the time of day right around sunrise when the sky is still a pale bluish gray the streets are empty and the grass and leaves are a little bit sparkly with dew you are the sound of a few chirpy birds outside the window you are quiet peaceful and contemplative if you move slowly its not because youre lazy but because you know theres no reason to rush you move like a relaxed cat pausing for deep stretches that make your muscles feel alive you are long sips of tea or coffee out of a mug thats held with both hands that slowly warm your insides just as the sun is brightening the sky
610283 you know its not about you its about your country
610284 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
610285 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
610286 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
610287 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
610288 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
610289 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
610290 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
610291 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
610292 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
610293 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
610294 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
610295 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
610296 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
610297 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
610298 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
610299 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
610300 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
610301 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
610302 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
610303 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
610304 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
610305 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
610306 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
610307 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
610308 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
610309 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
610310 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
610311 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
610312 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
610313 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
610314 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
610315 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
610316 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
610317 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
610318 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
610319 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
610320 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
610321 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
610322 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
610323 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
610324 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
610325 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
610326 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
610327 lots more work needs to be done but what these discoveries will do is help us start to classify the sub types of the illness so that individualised targeted medicine is possible in the future
610328 at the moment a broad range of anti psychotic drugs are used to treat schizophrenia but because people respond to drugs in different ways treatments are largely trial and error and often involve unpleasant side effects
610329 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
610330 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
610331 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
610332 those ads really were focused on two things they were focused on the fact that sen obama wants to raise taxes and im opposed of it and he opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling so the message there is therere stark differences between myself and sen obama
610333 i think we should be in a post racial environment
610334 i think sen barack obama has done an admirable job of that i dont think he has race baited i think he has been very good about that
610335 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
610336 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
610337 sitting at home in his mothers basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons amp dragons
610338 sen john mccain of arizona is the only republican who promises to end the george bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
610339 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
610340 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper
610341 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
610342 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances
610343 for starters their editorials are decidedly liberal thats a no brainer and there are often complaints that even their general reporting is biased in subtle and not so subtle ways the new york times has come to be associated with the northeast liberal establishment
610344 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
610345 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
610346 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
610347 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
610348 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
610349 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
610350 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
610351 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
610352 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
610353 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up

610357 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
610358 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
610359 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
610360 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
610361 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
610362 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
610363 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
610364 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
610365 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply

610367 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
610368 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
610369 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
610370 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
610371 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
610372 i did not have the material advantages but through commitment and using the advantages that i did have and listening to the wise men and women who offered their support i was able to live my dream
610373 you have inspired me since i was a young boy dreaming of one day standing here in my youth i watched every game i could some kids play cops and robbers but i emulated you you are my heroes
610374 my journey here has been a long one a long road and it hasnt always been easy
610375 what can i say about my mom thank you for teaching me perseverance life wasnt easy for us moving from birmingham ala to newark n j with not much more than the clothes on our back
610376 i am so proud to be a patriot for 26 years and i hope to be a patriot for another 26 years
610377 from the day i was cut from my freshman football team coach frank verducci instilled in me the proper mind set to play this great game
610378 in truth coach verducci taught us to recognize our strengths as well as our weaknesses and to raise our hand if it was our fault in honor he taught us to be proud of our name he always said rob me of my money and you have nothing but rob me of my name and you take my most prized possession in light coach wanted all of us to get an education he said only a fool doesnt go to school coach thank you and i love you
610379 andre insisted that i take him to davids room so he could offer him words of encouragement
610380 that visit means a tremendous amount to my son and left a lasting impression on me
610381 i shall cherish this moment for the rest of my life
610382 it felt good i kind of felt like a kid on christmas day
610383 i was up all early and we didnt have practice until later it felt good to get out here and kind of mix it up a bit
610384 i think everybody that comes out here especially at corner wants to be the no 1 guy thats how i felt when i came in as a rookie i wanted to prove and show that im the no 1 guy and thats how i feel now i want to go out there and prove and show it but there is a process and things take time this isnt a sprint by no means its a marathon
610385 i had to put so much focus into getting myself to whatever percent if there is such a thing as percent to be healthy enough to play each game that i didnt have time to think about who was criticizing me and this and that
610386 we got guys out here that you still dont know about that had stuff going on mine just ended up getting into the public
610387 you just try to do whatever you can to get out there
610388 i feel like im never in a position to say you know what team go ahead im done i get paid to play i dont get paid to sit out
610389 i just made a promise to myself as soon as we got those surgeries taken care of i wouldnt move a muscle until i was full go
610390 when i got healthy enough to start participating and start working out and things its just been to the wall trying to get back
610391 we worked so hard to get back to training with the rest of everybody
610392 beforehand we were just working to get to that level now we can go on with the rest of the team

610401 its football season now im trying to put everything behind me and concentrate on the season now
610402 its a good thing i have the support of a great organization and my teammates were all behind me and my family and my wife its just time to focus on the season now and put everything behind me
610403 im not going to comment on that im just trying to move on past that and put everything behind me
610404 well i definitely did not want to bring anything like that to them
610405 you definitely got to be embarrassed of things that you do but to be a man you got to take what you did wrong and move past it and step up so thats what im doing now
610406 i was a little bit rusty i think really not so much running i felt in shape and everything like that but just catching the ball and when theyre coming on a line you just got to get used to those
610407 made sure i got on the jugs machine afterwards and worked on that stuff so its just one of those deals you have to get used to and get better at

610410 granting an evil calculated killer any kind of dispensation is criminal and leaves the judiciary with blood on its hands
610411 the decision to surrender to the appeal of this cold blooded murderer is nothing but unforgivable i urge you to do whatever is needed to reverse this travesty of justice
610412 to say that i and the 140 000 police officers i represent throughout england and wales are appalled and disgusted with the decision that david bieber will now not serve a whole life sentence is a gross understatement and my heart goes out to pc ian broadhursts family
610413 this is shockingly disrespectful to his memory and illustrates the utter travesty of our criminal justice system where the rights of a cop killer outweigh the rights of a fallen officers family friends and colleagues david bieber is a monster with no consideration for life
610414 the fact that his appeal was initially lodged on the grounds that it contravened his human rights is ludicrous he showed no mercy or concern for human rights when he ignored pc broadhursts appeal pleading for his life before being executed at point blank range
610415 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the new york police department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable
610416 i think i found jesus on a cheeto as funny as that sounds
610417 i looked at that and i thought oh my that looks like jesus on the cross it was just like wow
610418 if people can find jesus somehow in each of us like shes found in this object that would be a wonderful thing

610428 seriously contrary to the public interest on the grounds that it would adversely and seriously affect relations between the uk and saudi arabian governments and would almost inevitably prevent the uk securing its largest export contract in the last decade
610429 no one whether within this country or outside is entitled to interfere with the course of our justice
610430 it is the failure of government and the defendants to bear that essential principal in mind that justified the intervention of this court
610431 a real and immediate risk of a collapse in u k saudi security intelligence and diplomatic cooperation
610432 first of all these allegations are strenuously denied by the saudi royal family secondly if we were then going to conduct an investigation then that might last two three years into these allegations that frankly i think would lead absolutely nowhere
610433 what it would lead to is the complete wreckage of a relationship that is of fundamental importance of the security of this country to the state of the middle east and to our relationship with countries in the middle east
610434 i was asked for my advice as to what damage this investigation would do if it continued i gave that advice because of the huge importance of working with saudi arabia on the middle east peace process on counter terrorism on the situation in the middle east
610435 i stick by that and the idea frankly that such an investigation could be conducted without doing damage to our relationship is cloud cuckoo land which after all is the natural habitat of the liberal democrats
610436 had such a threat been made by one who is subject to the criminal law of this country he would risk being charged with an attempt to pervert the course of justice
610437 why the pursuance by the sfo of its independent statutory powers of investigation could properly be regarded as a breach of duty of confidentiality by the united kingdom government
610438 investigation and prosecution of the bribery of a foreign public official shall be subject to the applicable rules and principles of each party they shall not be influenced by considerations of national economic interest the potential effect upon relations with another state or the identity of the natural or legal persons involved
610439 sabemos que es un partido muy complicado porque bol var este ltimo estuvo subiendo su nivel y para colmo nosotros vamos disminuidos sin embargo no es para lamentarse ni mucho menos porque los que estaremos en la cancha nos daremos ntegros en procura de sumar unidades que es lo m s importante para nosotros que venimos de realizar un trabajo exigente y creo que eso nos servir a la hora de jugar ese partido
610440 en realidad en el partido del domingo al margen de demostrar el por qu fui llamado a la selecci n tengo que pensar en lo que se puede hacer dentro el campo de juego porque de nada servir a jugar presionado o pensando en la opini n de los dem s lo importante ser que todos podamos hacer bien las cosas para lograr un resultado positivo
610441 regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
610442 the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 mile per hour and that driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
610443 the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision
610444 benefitting from early detection through a doctor ordered mri the cancer is not life threatening
610445 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
610446 we know theyre going to fight us tooth and nail
610447 theres a pretty vocal group of anti tax folks in torrance that we have to contend with and we really have to battle
610448 i think the climate is worse than it was two years ago
610449 were paying 4 a gallon for gasoline i dont see how you can sell the community on a bond that is going to tax us for the next 30 years
610450 people will be going to the polls on both sides of the issue
610451 but if it doesnt im hoping maybe theyll listen to some of the ideas i have
610452 it was very very practical to have our headquarters in torrance
610453 theyre used to certain products theyre used to certain services and once they start to proliferate in the area theyre living in it makes them feel more comfortable
610454 this is where all of the asian industry is headed
610455 and torrance is in the epicenter of a major tourist market
610456 the service the feeling the atmosphere the ambiance is perfect the whole hotel flows
610457 the south bay is a melting pot for japanese start up businesses
610458 theres a lot of japanese restaurants a lot of japanese businesses here that they can network with
610459 they feel like theyre almost at home in fact the wives that come with the businessmen stick together they dont even learn english and they go home without speaking english
610460 people look at you from head to toe like you dont belong there ive been there twice and never again this is america if you come here you should learn english
610461 it was something i didnt understand but that doesnt mean it was not a legitimate business
610462 it looks pretty fancy and theyre going to throw a ton of money at it
610463 im just not sure that whats a good fit in korea is a good fit here
610464 i think the korean clientele understands the cultural context of the spa quite well but not necessarily the non korean clientele i would just be concerned about anything in torrance that might attract undesirable public behavior
610465 we have to make some effort to be accepted or be understood
610466 we want anybody to walk into our market and walk out with everything they need
610467 a lot of the old school koreans go to the other one
610468 my wife prefers this one for its better quality she says its better organized
610469 i like the fact all our markets are showing more diversity in the products they are selling
610470 the industry has become star dependent everyone wants recovery of his investment and working with stars becomes the safe bet
610471 there is more and more money coming in the market ever since the corporate world has entered the world of cinema
610472 also the actors are aware of the fact that they can ask for more money
610473 life has been very satisfying it was my fathers dream that the santoor should get recognition it was his dream that i become as famous as ustad bismillah khan what i am today is because of him his dream has come true
610474 at a concert in barcelona a few years ago i was totally engrossed in my performance when i was disturbed by the sound of a tanpura going off key
610475 panditji was speaking on the sidelines of the premier of a documentary antardhwani on his life and achievements directed by renowned theatre director jabbar patel
610476 an 8 year old little girl is dead and all of a sudden all of the stats dont seem that important and i mean they are but it was an 8 year old girl who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time
610477 this is a job that nobody has had before you are sort of making it up as you go
610478 there is an urgency here people are dying people are getting shot it is devastating communities devastating lives
610479 he needs at least three years after you have things rolled out in the right order what i am afraid of is he is not going to have enough money
610480 everybody thinks they have the best program around and they are doing it the right way
610481 jeff has had to work his way through a minefield
610482 no one man is going to make a dent without a united front
610483 carr is putting his foot in the door its not going to come overnight
610484 to be successful you got to show me institutions where there are transformations where a kid walks out the other side where he has a changed self esteem right now kids are going in the streets and hanging out with homeboys
610485 what is going to be the challenge is whether communities feel they are being heard and whether programs are parachuting in
610486 i am actually a minister more than i work for the mayor and if you wouldnt mind i would like to pray for you because thats all i know how to do
610487 it was like my gosh can i really do anything to stop this stuff
610488 the required removal of shoes at the security checkpoint is one of the biggest complaints we get from passengers so we are trying something new that will allow us to maintain a high level of security while accommodating travelers
610489 the scanners are here but were just waiting for the airport to change the electrical connections to accommodate the machines
610490 the success of this technology relies on whether the tsa will get too many false alarms or if the technology does not detect suspicious items the way it should
610491 but the tsa is to be applauded for their efforts to speed up the checkpoint process because one of the greatest hassles of flying is having to take off your shoes during the screening process
610492 theyre going to charge me with embezzlement and take my ring
610493 i want to let the public know that this is just one more thing theyve done to me
610494 what it is is somebody just using the system to perpetuate hullabaloo over non hullabaloo able stuff shes a fruitcake and shes coming unwound
610495 to think one person could destroy a persons life is amazing i dont think its right
610496 every check that was written out of that account was written to her or her husband
610497 she would cash most of the checks and leave a small amount in the bank it was a combination of cash back and forged checks
610498 henry got rid of me because i was trying to show him what the protocol was but he was going to do it henrys way
610499 hes done it all henry hoskins im sure is in on this ring thing everyone should know what theyre doing to me
610500 she wants to get back at somebody and im the one she wants to get back at
610501 i think that when everybody started finding out what was happening and put the office in hiatus to determine what was wrong there was accountability going on and i think it started freaking her out i think she didnt expect that people would follow through
610502 how can you compare owning a handgun to civil rights as with blacks and other minorities being discriminated a gun in a car isnt the same as a black person told to go to the back of the line
610503 dans certains cas la violence qui se d chaine est lexpression dune autre violence qui ressurgit dun pass fait dabandons de traumatisme ou de profondes carences
610504 on navait m me pas attendu freud pour imaginer que des carences affectives pouvaient laisser des traces de l justifier un acharnement par ces seuls aspects est risible pas de r ponse la question z ro point
610505 certains narrivent pas r aliser la violence et lintensit de ceci parfois un acte violent peut se retracer partir de la violence dune histoire personnelle ou familiale ce qui nexcuse rien mais permet de rechercher une esquisse de sens
610506 si la col re qui peut saisir tout un chacun peut surprendre par son intensit et sa violence les interdits que nous avons int rioris s prot gent la plupart du temps contre des actes plus graves
610507 guess i will have to do some doodlesockin to get them to bite

610509 you are competing with other communities that have already answered these questions when a site consultant calls with questions you have to be ready
610510 the area is beneficial for the area region metro little rock and the state it says saline county central arkansasand the entire state is open for business
610511 i will not choose one county over another i will fight the other 49 states to bring jobs to this state but when it comes to choosing one town over another we wont get into that business
610512 i just thought id bring my clothes home to you
610513 if they are going home to parents that are using drugs or alcohol in front of them how are they going to change they need a place to go so they can transition to a structured environment where they have someone to support them
610514 we are collaborating with area businesses to come in and do mock interviews they will tell them everything from how to dress to how to answer interview questions properly
610515 in the interview they are going to have to tell me why they need a chance they are going to have to convince me to help them
610516 im not going to waste money on someone who is not trying to make things better
610517 while they are in the program they will go to a school of their choice that is local it can be a four year university a community college or a technical school its up to the women
610518 it just has to be local so we can take them there daily
610519 i have worked at worked at the alexander youth services center the pine bluff youth center and mansfield wilderness camp which has let me learn how all the facilities are different i got to see that we are housing the kids but we are not showing them how to go back into the world
610520 my mom had no education but she worked hard her whole life she gave me and my siblings everything we needed but not everything we wanted she taught me that once you get older you have to have values
610521 then on the other hand all three of my aunts have degrees and i got to see how that was worthwhile it showed me the successful side
610522 i am passionate about this this is something we need for our females to succeed
610523 my aunts and mom helped me and now i am going to help these young women make it through
610524 the parade goes through downtown from harps grocery all the way to spring park
610525 sie sagte als erstes wie froh sie sei nette leute zu sehen
610526 these data corroborate what many of us suspected that the epidemic is worse than we thought however it doesnt seem to be getting worse
610527 unsere leute im basislager haben den tod von zwei nepalesen zwei koreanern und einem pakistanischen tr ger best tigt
610528 wir wissen noch nicht wie sich die geplante permanente immunisierung auswirkt
610529 die frage stellt sich deshalb nicht weil ein nahezu fertiges endlager in deutschland vorhanden ist und zu sagen das sch tten wir wieder zu und fangen irgendwo anders von vorne an das w rde uns 30 jahre zur ckwerfen
610530 ma stab f r die laufzeit muss die sicherheit sein und ich habe in der tat darauf hingewiesen dass international heute oftmals 60 jahre angegeben werden aber das kann man nicht durch gesetz festlegen
610531 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
610532 it was a big decision for me i was nervous i didnt think i could do it
610533 in the er you see a lot more broken bones car wrecks and gunshot wounds so you are always learn ing you do a lot more reading and you make many more decisions
610534 in the er you are the doctor youre on your own
610535 we found a building in gurdon that used to be a doctors office that we will use the details have not been completely worked out yet but i think its a great thing considering gurdon doesnt have access to a doctor at all
610536 my parents live in conway so its close to them and i think arkadelphia will make a great fit for me and my family
610537 when you go to church or to the grocery store you see your patients and their families and i like that i want to know my patients when they come in without having to look at their charts
610538 the health care system is broken because there are just not enough doctors all the clinics are full so patients think they have to use the er as a clin ic therefore making the wait time in many ers around six hours
610539 if i need to move a patient to a trauma center there is just too much red tape to go through with insurance companies its unnecessary
610540 i have heard and read about many good potential solutions i do not think that a universal health care system will work in the ways it has been utilized in other countries i think through privatization of health care and allowing patients to purchase health insurance and health care accounts would allow the market to competitively bring prices down
610541 insurance companies should be able to compete more for customers and decrease the amount of uninsured americans
610542 my dad and grandfather are both workaholics so i guess i sort of inherited that all through high school i worked as a bricklayer which was hard work
610543 laura and i have been married since 1998 so she is used to my schedule she was there for me throughout medicalschool and now that we have kids we have to find that balance of time
610544 when i go home i spend time with my kids and sometimes that means i have to sacrifice sleep
610545 i have seen many patients who ask to see an older doctor i always tell them that as a younger doctor i am more up to date on the latest treatments and drugs and since i am younger i find that i have to always have confidence
610546 even if i am second guessing myself i cant show it i have to know what im doing
610547 i think it makes them better everyone but one on the basketball team plays football
610548 every bit of my time is spent with my family
610549 i never wanted to be a college coach because i knew i wouldnt be able to be around my family as much
610550 when that thing is not important to me anymore ill quit
610551 if its to the point that i cant have an effect on their lives
610552 mike did a great job and he was wellrespected by his peers around the state he left the district in a position to keep moving forward greenbrier has a history of academic achievement and our teachers and support staff work hard to do whats best for this district
610553 our parents always stressed to us how important education is school has always been a natural part of our lives
610554 it is a huge challenge to produce students who can compete globally and find quality teachers for public schools research shows that a lot of teachers leave the profession by their fifth year
610555 we have to make our working environment one that theyre proud of and want to continue to work in
610556 ill be getting to know theteaching staff and families of the district to create those partnerships needed to continue leading the district forward
610557 education as a whole is toolarge for one person to do everything but i understand at the end of the day im the one who is held accountable so i try to give others opportunities to be active participants
610558 i think a lot of times people think superintendents are more concerned about the financial than student achievement and that were unapproachable were just regular folks trying to do a job
610559 i enjoy going to elementary school and seeing the faces of the kindergartners and firstgraders there is just something about the newness of it all and the anticipation of whats coming in the new year
610560 this class is designed to explore the visions of space travel and life in space through the soundtracks of works such as doctor who 2001 star wars cowboy bebop and firefly
610561 music in movies is always intriguing but i think musicin sci fi plays an even more integral role than in other genres
610562 come with questions and ready to enjoy some great sci fi moments
610563 i am in love with ronnie i should hope hes in love with me we didnt mean to fall in love you cant choose who you fall in love with
610564 people fall in love despite an age gap i fancy him because of the person he is i dont think about his age or the fact hes a rolling stone
610565 this is an entrance to our mosques and it the ramp as well as the archeological remains is awqaf property
610566 to show a picture of having discussed the issue with others while in the end imposing everything on the ground

610571 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges
610572 seriously seeking to increase the size of joint investments to more than 3 billion over the next years
610573 we do not have any strikers apart from wayne rooney and carlos tevez and frazier plays in that area
610574 he took his goal really well and that wont do him any harm
610575 even at this increased distance from the final i am more angry
610576 i think the referee blew against us he was partial to say the least
610577 he did not show the spaniards a red card and he did not give us a handball decision
610578 then right before the end we had a chance and he just blew in my opinion there was something wrong with him
610579 both players showed good movement and so did steven gerrard
610580 dirk kuyt and yossi benayoun were coming inside so i felt we had five offensive players very clever and with quality so we were a threat all the time
610581 keane is very clever and he worked hard he is very happy here and hopefully we will see a lot of good movement and also goals from him
610582 gerrard torres and keane playing together was one of the keys to keeping possession
610583 but i feel we have some good players in the team different players with different qualities and a good mentality
610584 the first half was okay but in the second half they needed to go forward in front of their supporters
610585 we had more space and we scored the second goal on the counter attack
610586 but from the start of the game we wanted to impress and we wanted to win
610587 we worked hard had plenty of possession and wanted to keep a high tempo with the ball
610588 we scored once and had one or two problems near the end of the first half but we controlled it
610589 es tan floja que da m s risa que miedo
610590 i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love
610591 to me face to face he always told me he wants to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me
610592 he is not going anywhere even if you come with a 747 plane full of money
610593 we had a very young side especially in the first half and played well
610594 we were unlucky to concede the goal and maybe lacked a bit of experience to score as well as some physical match sharpness
610595 there were some heavy legs but it will get better over the next two weeks
610596 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have
610597 if we can find someone the we will do it if not i am happy as well
610598 do not form an impression on his small size because he is not phased by the physical challenges
610599 he really looks mature on the pitch but he is 16 and we have to respect his development
610600 however do not reproach me now about not playing english players
610601 what pleased me was our defence and we did a lot of things well
610602 however we took a lot of time to get into the game
610603 in the first half especially we looked tired and its not like weve played a lot of friendlies
610604 but we began to get more into it in the second half and we succeeded in doing well
610605 winning this competition doesnt interest me apart from the fact that its always nice to win something
610606 it would be nice to win for the fans but they know that were working to prepare ourselves well for a good season
610607 hes fantastic its as if hes always played with us
610608 hes everywhere even when we dont have the ball and his passing is brilliant it really seems as if hes been with us for years
610609 it was a difficult match where only one goal won it
610610 it was a very difficult match for us even though we are aware that we dominated
610611 but its the team of the highest level and we are already trying to work towards the preliminary round of the champions league
610612 tomorrow we have another difficult game and then we have another one against manchester united in a few days time
610613 but these are matches that are at the highest level matches that the team need and matches that we need to win
610614 but i think we have a good team and that we have a great desire to win and that things are good all in all

610635 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
610636 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
610637 we have identified around 3 500 of these temporary consents but we operate on a risk basis
610638 because most of these have not been identified as unsatisfactory and are low risk to water quality they are not a priority of ours

610643 we missed out on the upside that many of the big new york firms were getting but we dont face the downside either
610644 we are monitoring our business very closely and within a reasonable degree of tolerance revenues are tracking very closely to where they were in 2007
610645 we are simply a little less subject to market volatility for better or for worse
610646 we are all worried that the next deal is not coming in but so far they are coming in
610647 when you see big layoffs and every speck of news that you read is negative it is surprising to see things going up
610648 we would be very interested in assets that arent core to wachovias business
610649 i think youll see a lot of that over the next six to 12 months
610650 i cant imagine that markets like philadelphia would ever be considered noncore by wachovia
610651 they should sell their new york city locations where they have been a total failure
610652 i think from new york south theyre pretty well entrenched
610653 those deposit franchises have a lot of value but my guess is when wachovia talks about the northeast they mean new york and new england from philadelphia they have such a good earnings stream they dont want to cut that off
610654 i dont think anybody could have envisioned the downturn in the lending community the contraction of the trade and the pressure thats been applied to the consumer by higher prices and less lending less credit availability

610663 you dont just go out and needlessly shop as a hobby its really kind of an eye opener
610664 all that was money out the window we could not keep going like that and make ends meet
610665 people are coming for all different reasons with credit card debt or others who say my kids are so materialistic and out of control
610666 the real surprise is that its so much easier than you would think

610670 we asked him for a picture first then we said do you wanna come to a party he said yeah he kept knocking back our drink
610671 i was sitting beside him but i think he was more interested in speaking to her
610672 he gave her a kiss when the picture was taken
610673 hugh was getting a lot of attention but it was mainly her who was flirting with him
610674 i love his film notting hill we spent about two hours at the party with him and i was sitting next to him on the couch i kissed him on the cheek so i could get a photo on my camera phone
610675 he was trying to guess what subjects we all did he was really nice and charming
610676 he was lapping up the attention and he was quite drunk it came across as a bit sleazy sort of like his character daniel cleaver in the film bridget jones diary
610677 socially responsible investing somewhat lies in the eyes of the beholder
610678 natural gas is far more efficient and environmentally friendly than fuels like coal so where we can we take the more environmentally friendly fuel
610679 the problem is that people buy a fund after the manager has proved that they are a high performer but they sell the first time theres a problem
610680 they wind up chasing performance buying high and selling low instead of sticking with a manager who has proved that they can deliver if you give them enough time
610681 that they can dig out of a hole because you have to believe they can create return fast enough to help you catch up from any down period you want them to be able to live up to the expectation you had for the fund when you first bought it which means you have to believe they can get performance back to what you expected over time
610682 when a manager loses conviction in what they are doing thats a problem
610683 that he might sanctify and cleanse the church with the washing of water by the word
610684 today we have absolutely no concerns about the organization no regrets come the 9th of august the opening day of competition the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over

610691 no as the real killers sivarasan suba and dhanu were already dead
610692 its a great heraldic device but we need to take it over properly and put them in their place
610693 we do the late 15th century early 16th century form they would have had time by then to improve their health and safety
610694 there were extra safety features for instance in the early competitions they wouldnt had had anything between the horses by the later time we had had the tilt the bars down the middle
610695 it is an impact sport you can come off people do
610696 you dont believe it until it happens but your armour does protect you a certain amount
610697 it might hurt in some places but on the whole it does tend to protect you i didnt believe until it happened to me my armour is stainless steel and is quite thick
610698 it splinters and give you a better visual impact i understand they had just started to use hollow or jointed lances
610699 the horse is paramount its what we care about the most its absolutely vital that nothing happens to them
610700 it would have been import at the time a really good joust horse would be like ferrari to them
610701 ive always loved doing differing things with horses we find that once they been going for bit they really love to do it they are excited about doing it
610702 if a man is proud of his wealth he should not be praised until it is known how he employs it
610703 if miliband succeeds in toppling brown labour can anticipate almost a generation of feuding in the short term cameron may miss the easy target his dour and lumbering opponent across the commons chamber but if labour ruptures once more then the conservatives could look forward not just to an election win but also to another era of political supremacy
610704 the poll starkly illustrates the charisma gap between the two main party leaders with just one per cent of respondents regarding mr brown as very charismatic compared with 18 per cent for mr cameron and given a choice between taking a holiday with gordon and sarah brown or david and samantha cameron 42 per cent said they would join the camerons compared with 19 per cent the browns

610709 brown is trapped in a narrative from which there is no escape the polls will not improve greatly in the autumn and yet this period is now being seen as his defining test meanwhile the leadership question drowns out all other ministerial messages suddenly one question overwhelms all others how to end the noise there is a single answer fairly or not and whatever the risks only cathartic change brings the chance of calm milibands intervention makes it more likely than not that labour will have a new leader by the end of the year
610710 gordon browns allies yesterday accused david miliband of self serving disloyalty and weakening the prime ministers authority after the foreign secretary provoked a firestorm of speculation over his leadership ambitions with an article in the guardian calling on labour to find a new forward vision to defeat the tories
610711 his years at mr blairs side have made him a reformer but one who believes firmly in government action
610712 the only way forward now is bold labour what we want to see is the gordon brown of bank of england independence surestart and make poverty history i think that his responsibility is to provide the bold and decisive leadership that we now need

610719 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits

610725 we will not have a road map as to how to go forward or any set of proposals until way into the far end of this year
610726 we will have a progress report in october for the european council
610727 either suggesting that there will be a referendum or that the date will be the second half of 2009 is premature
610728 nothing has been settled yet nothing of that nature has really been discussed by the government yet
610729 instead of reconvening for a day at the beginning of september to address the lisbon treaty issues alone the dail should reconvene to address all the issues that are in urgent need of being addressed and remain in session
610730 i know the antipathy the first one referendum evoked from the electorate
610731 as soon as one was addressed well then there was another one
610732 i feel that that would be the way it would continue

610809 bien que le journaliste ait imm diatement ajout quil savait quon avait accord la grande bretagne une d rogation permanente pour lautoriser continuer utiliser les mesures anglaises pour les panneaux routiers et que tout changement ne pourrait tre que le fait du gouvernement et du parlement britanniques
610810 le journaliste voulait n anmoins savoir si je connaissais quelquun au parlement europ en qui voulait enterrer le mile m me si cela paraissait hors de propos lheure actuelle
610811 sesi pertama kualifikasi kemarin sangat kompetitif tapi kami mampu meraih q3 dengan kedua mobil kami ini tentu positif tapi saya rasa balapan akan sulit itu sudah pasti

610814 there remain of europe first macedonia and the parts of thrace that are contiguous to it and extend as far as byzantium secondly greece and thirdly the islands that are close by macedonia of course is a part of greece yet now since i am following the nature and shape of the places geographically i have decided to classify it apart from the rest of greece and to join it with that part of thrace which borders on it and extends as far as the mouth of the euxine and the propontis then a little further on strabo mentions cypsela and the hebrus river and also describes a sort of parallelogram in which the whole of macedonia lies
610815 and even to the present day the thracians illyrians and epeirotes live on the flanks of the greeks though this was still more the case formerly than now indeed most of the country that at the present time is indisputably greece is held by the barbarians macedonia and certain parts of thessaly by the thracians and the parts above acarnania and aetolia by the thesproti the cassopaei the amphilochi the molossi and the athamanes epeirotic tribes
610816 what is now called macedonia was in earlier times called emathia and it took its present name from macedon one of its early chieftains and there was also a city emathia close to the sea now a part of this country was taken and held by certain of the epeirotes and the illyrians but most oii by the bottiaei and the thracians the bottiaei came from crete originally so it is said along with botton as chieftain as for the thracians the pieres inhabited pieria and the region about olympus the paeones the region on both sides of the axius river which on that account is called amphaxitis the edoni and bisaltae the rest of the country as far as the strymon of these two peoples the latter are called bisaltae alone whereas a part of the edoni are called mygdones a part edones and a part sithones but of all these tribes the argeadae as they are called established themselves as masters and also the chalcidians of euboea for the chalcidians of euboea also came over to the country of the sithones and jointly peopled about thirty cities in it although later on the majority of them were ejected and came together into one city olynthus and they were named the thracian chalcidians
610817 when the euboeans were returning from troy some of them after being driven out of their course to illyria set out for home through macedonia but remained in the neighborhood of edessa after aiding in war those who had received them hospitably and they founded a city euboe
610818 from its melody and rhythm and instruments all thracian music has been considered to be asiatic
610819 and again of the epeirotes the molossi became subject to pyrrhus the son of neoptolemus the son of achilles and to his descendants who were thessalians but the rest were ruled by men of native stock
610820 it is said that orestes once took possession of orestias when in exile on account of the murder of his mother and left the country bearing his name and that he also founded a city and called it argos oresticum
610821 after having described as much of the western parts of europe as is comprised within the interior and exterior seas and surveyed all the barbarous nations which it contains as far as the don and
610822 but after they had intrusted to lycurgus the formation of a political constitution they acquired such a superiority over the other greeks that they alone obtained the sovereignty both by sea and land and continued to be the chiefs of the greeks till the thebans and soon afterwards the macedonians deprived them of this ascendency
610823 the veneration for this god prevailed so strongly among the greeks that the macedonians even when masters of the country nevertheless preserved even to the present time the privilege of the asylum and were restrained by shame from dragging away the suppliants who took refuge at calauria
610824 the acarnanians and the tolians like many other nations are at present worn out and exhausted by continual wars

610826 conditions will take away with one hand what has been given with the other
610827 would literally take away with one hand what has been given with the other
610828 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
610829 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapon states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
610830 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
610831 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
610832 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
610833 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
610834 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties
610835 we dont want a situation where there is some kind of fait accompli and we dont have time to examine things
610836 we have to have tie ups with a b c d and e but the nsg is a cartel so all countries could get together and the redundancy we are seeking to build could get reduced to a knot in one stroke
610837 our aim is for the redundancy to remain protected this is the main thing we have to achieve that is what is behind the slogan of a clean and unconditional exemption and i am firm and committed that we must get this
610838 we have six reactors that are already under separate safeguards all of them can be subsumed under the issa and as and when someone wants to cooperate with us everything else can be brought into this as well the nsg guidelines are there for the suppliers but if someone wants to trade with india the issa is useful
610839 first multilateral instrument that recognises there is a nuclear programme in the country which remains outside the civil programme
610840 so i believe the issa is useful by itself though our intention is not to remain there but to go beyond and start cooperation
610841 if you want to go to a new equilibrium you have to be in troubled waters first in a frozen situation you cannot make change
610842 and there is no reason to assume those intentions are benign i e that they are just looking for business opportunities
610843 what is needed is courage and determination to see this through

610847 more than 20 patrol and cargo aircraft have been made available to assess the disaster and deliver relief supplies many of those aircraft are already on the scene we have dispatched the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln the maritime pre positioning squadron from guam and an amphibious ship carrying a marine expeditionary unit they will soon be in position to support relief efforts to include the generation of clean water
610848 the delegation will be led by secretary of state colin powell and governor jeb bush who has extensive experience in the state of florida with relief rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts following natural disasters
610849 i said yesterday that 150 000 would be my estimate i am sure it will be higher than that but im also sure we will never know how many people were washed to sea and will never ever be found
610850 from what some of the aid workers are saying you can go up to the airport and you can see aid just lying in there they are saying they do not have the trucks they do not have the petrol for the trucks they do not have the people to ferry the aid to the refugees they also say they do not have a clear idea of how many refugees there actually are not only in banda aceh itself but in the surrounding outlying areas

610883 burlesque comes from the latin root burlar to make fun of
610884 eighty years ago burlesque was considered the lowest of the low it still is but now people can accept that burlesque is now considered mainstream you can take courses in it at nyu
610885 the way people consume entertainment now its mainly television and its click click click people are used to roving through things very quickly
610886 burlesque came back in the late 90s in places like the lower east side dumbo
610887 the performers strip they use pasties but sometimes theyre aerialists or clowns i see them as a series of talent home runs
610888 modern burlesque is about eroticism and titillation but its also often about a three minute story
610889 when you look around a burlesque audience you see guys who are there for a t show but other guys are there for the comedy
610890 you generally will not see anyone get down below bikinis and tassels what i think has happened is that we have been dulled to stimulation by the overstimulation we experience in everyday life
610891 i find that a lot of the managers and agents and stuff like that are very very very much more forgiving than i thought but everyone does like a comeback story i hate to say it everyone loves a sob story i hate to say that too but it is what it is
610892 i have a few things coming out right now so i dont want any pity i dont want any sob stories i just like want to work for my money work for my craft
610893 i really dont care about my show right now i want to get back into the movie business and not really worry about the feldman camp
610894 everythings contrived and scripted i was way too honest this year but i hope it helps somebody
610895 and find loopholes and loopholes and try to make corey haim look mean and really s ty and susie feldmans wife is in there too and i dont respect it and i dont want anything to do with corey feldman but i did sign for i think three seasons so if i have to do it of course im a professional im not going to breach ill do my show
610896 you know im a human being and i make mistakes like on this season hes really really hit on that so what kind of friend is he hes not and everyone sees this what really hurts me is that ive known him for over 23 24 years i know hes doing it so it doesnt hurt me it just pisses me off fake human beings bad friends
610897 no man im going to make lemons into pink lemonade and take the supporting role that they were nice enough to keep me in because ive been doing a good job in my real life like life life as corey just bernie and judys son just corey man and im going to turn it into the best role i can
610898 now im back ive got people calling me i want nothing to do with anymore nothing i was told this would happen
610899 but this is where you make new friends and you start living and learning so im a late bloomer im 36 but hey im learning every days a learning experience right
610900 i dont know we came to detroit a couple of times and i think somebody who makes money booking us said
610901 yeah man why dont you go up to toronto and i said aw no i dont wanna go in and out so quickly and besides its next to detroit lets just wait or something its probably my fault but its worked out now anyway
610902 sometimes i am i listen to em usually if ive been off for awhile and were going out thats when i listen to em and i have some sort of reaction to just the general vibe like
610903 but when they sound the best to me is when i hear em like through a door or through a wall or driving by somewhere by accident then they sound really good
610904 ill be outside a club in the parking lot or something and it comes through the door and i cant quite make out what it is but its like f wasnt that yknow life theyre not lifeless and at the time the stooges records were made it was definitely better to have been spayed if you were rock n roll and you had your balls cut off you were gonna do better
610905 its been tremendously satisfying to start getting worldly success for the group both in terms of the group finally starting to do something for its members and also to have the group show an ability to shake people up a little bit in the front and back rows
610906 where we had left off people were usually just frozen in fear horror curiosity or amazement you couldve heard a pin drop and that was fine for what it was but i felt little by little that the world sorta turned a little bit weve sorta met up halfway
610907 i did it myself for a chain of restaurants and pubs i just thought id have a stroke because youd have to eat such vast amounts
610908 you had these enormous sheets to fill in it was things like did a member of the staff catch your eye within 15 seconds did they greet you within 30 seconds there were pages and pages and pages of analysis about the most mundane kinds of exchanges with people
610909 it always struck me as very comical the things you would have to do in case the mystery customer was the person on the phone
610910 at the end of every phone call we were always supposed to say is there anything else i can help you with somebody would ring up and ask what time do you close tonight and you would say five thirty is there anything else i can help you with it was so artificial
610911 its not about a master plan or big brother watching you its mostly just bored security guards watching bored people doing their shopping or homing in on womens breasts
610912 the english press keeps describing me as dogged and tenacious
610913 rick rubin me ligou e disse que johnny cash queria gravar uma vers o de hurt eu fiquei orgulhoso mas nunca achei que fosse realmente acontecer duas semanas se passaram e eu recebi um cd pelo correio eu ouvi e foi muito estranho outra pessoa estava tomando conta da minha can o mais pessoal ouvir isso foi como ver algu m beijando minha namorada
610914 tonight the great pumpkin will rise out of the pumpkin patch

610916 tinha que fazer um retrato da juliette lewis para uma revista su a tinha muita coisa para fazer no dia e acabei tendo que fazer a foto depois do show quando olhei as fotos percebi que nunca vemos os astros do rock daquela forma quando mostrei as fotos para a juliette ela concordou e disse essa a forma de mostrar como realmente somos
610917 eu entendo porque um momento muito ntimo eu acho que a maioria deles s precisa de alguns minutos para se acalmar serem eles mesmos sem pose e longe do p blico e das c meras

610920 wont we be at all affected by what is going on in the rest of the country

610927 which is pretty immature filthy s t its all jacking off jokes
610928 what makes pineapple express more than entertaining is that its about a friendship and the parts i like best are the relationship between the two friends
610929 the stories me and evan think of are these friendship stories more than friendship
610930 look cameron crowe writes these male female love stories all the time and we write these male male love stories
610931 i so totally want to hook up with him one day
610932 look i have a great relationship with my girlfriend lauren miller but my relationship with my guy friends wow thats something else you can not see each other for a year or two and then you can pick up right where it was you cant do that with a girl
610933 people always say when were pitching s t why are girls going to like this
610934 i grew up in vancouver man thats where more than half of my style comes from
610935 most of my friends were from kerrisdale where the rich jewish kids lived
610936 we werent part of that world even if we werent actually poor
610937 all of our other friends were inside trying to hump the girls but fogel and evan and me were just outside hanging out making jokes and smoking weed
610938 were exactly like superbad lots of people were having sex but for my friends and i that was like so outside the realm of our experience no i didnt get laid in high school at all but it wasnt for lack of trying
610939 as soon as i realized you could be funny as a job that was the job i wanted
610940 when i was 16 my dad lost his job then my mother quit hers and they had to put our house on the market and move into a much smaller apartment
610941 but with your parents isnt it always a question of whos supporting who it was always the familys money it was never my money
610942 my money has always been useful to my family and it still is but i never felt i had a complex over it

610947 we tried it with the lime vodka first onboard and the gin version seemed to be more popular as a traditional martini flavour
610948 you can do such a variety of colours and flavours
610949 although chinas pursuit of olympic gold medals clearly coincides with the nations journey toward internationalization and achieving new status in the world
610950 the state driven championship mentality still reflects a combination of chinese can do and the countrys lingering inferiority complex
610951 a nation that obsesses over gold medals is not a self assured nation a government that needs gold medals to bolster nationalist sentiment and its domestic legitimacy is not a confident government and a population that cannot gracefully accept losses in sports is not a composed and secure population
610952 sports seem to bring people together regardless of their economic class political ideas or social rank
610953 given the widespread anger anxiety and frustration regarding social injustice in todays china sports as a focus of popular interest may bring about major social change if such a transformation occurs it could cause serious problems for the communist regime
610954 weve been visited on this planet and the ufo phenomena is real its been well covered up by all our governments for the last 60 years or so but slowly its leaked out and some of us have been privileged to have been briefed on some of it ive been in military and intelligence circles who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge yes we have been visited reading the papers recently its been happening quite a bit
610955 no as the real killers sivarasan suba and dhanu were already dead
610956 so its all i got i got the files added to c and start the command prompt and try to start makeing it and get this
610957 while members of congress are passionate about their views what congressman stark said during the debate was inappropriate and distracted from the seriousness of the subject at hand providing health care for americas children
610958 we applaud willie and his family who opted to have this operation done in the private sector rather than risking death waiting for the same surgery in a public hospital
610959 it is of course rather ironic that willie was once an mp for the far left alliance party which championed a second rate chain of under maintained hospitals that rationed out health care causing needless deaths for which no bureaucrat or politician was ever made accountable whatever would comrades laila harre phyllida bunkle and chris trotter think of willie now
610960 the reason many kiwis cant afford to do this is because half their income is taken from them in tax they cant afford to pay for surgery or even purchase private health insurance
610961 we want it oscars to have two identities you can have dinner in the restaurant then after you can hang out at the lounge watch some live sports and enjoy a drink or a cigar we also want people to know we have a lounge menu offering smaller things like the soon to be added chili burger
610962 if youre gonna have a steakhouse you need quality not many if any restaurants in shenzhen focus on steak and the quality of their meat
610963 the conscience and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual emotional or functional value
610964 okay im close to ejaculating time to use an arousal step down technique

610984 it was not unusual for a hundred people a week to have their necks snapped on the gallows and when overcrowding made it hard to accommodate new prisoners the death house worked overtime
610985 denied pow status and were held indefinitely in isolation and secrecy without charges or judicial recourse under exceptionally harsh conditions
610986 you had stress positions and you escalated the stress positions forced to stand for hours at a time stand on a box hold a box out straight hold bottles of water out to your side do the electric chair put your back to the wall and bend your knees ninety degrees to hold yourself handcuffs behind their backs high up in very uncomfortable positions or chained down
610987 all i did was what i was told to do i didnt make the war i cant end the war i mean photographs cant just make or change a war it just doesnt make sense i mean how do people see me as the villain
610988 i went to bed and its amazing because when youre laying there no matter how much music you play no matter how loud you turn it up you still hear the screams you still see the pictures you still see the vision of what was going on
610989 there was no excuse for it and there was nothing to show for it either no great score of useful intelligence no ends to justify the means
610990 it is an intensive hands on opportunity intended to provide a disciplined and focused period of work the program is designed to be of support to writers who are on the cusp of professional publication
610991 i love them even more than harry potter because theyre more grown up and kind of romantic
610992 there are a lot of people saying shes the heir apparent to j k rowling and theres some good reason for that
610993 every book has doubled the sales of the previous book
610994 its steadily growing and new readership is coming all the time daily in fact
610995 all of the activity happened in the blogosphere and social networking sites and thats really where this thing took off
610996 being a teen girl series i mean its just so natural for that particular customer and readership to share their enthusiasm electronically and thats exactly whats happened and stephenie meyer herself from the outset has been great about communicating with her fans on her own website so theyre just as actively engaged if not more actively engaged in the series as harry potter fans were
610997 the loyalists as a group have greatly influenced the development of nova scotia and it is appropriate that we commemorate the 225th anniversary of their arrival
610998 candid look at the highs and lows of his life and career
610999 each project that i embark on if its going to involve other people it has to involve people that i really really respect from their own individual art world
611000 harry and i have been friends for a long time and have collaborated on other things but i did not know he was an angler
611001 one of the ironies of the collaborative process is that it actually gives you more independence
611002 the book has a certain physical structure to it the camera that i work with uses film that is the same size as the images that you are looking at in the book so when i set up my camera and the light reflects off the subject it creates an impression on the film its a direct relationship of every molecule that is reflecting light directly to the film so that when i take a negative and process it and lay that on a piece of photographic paper and expose it all of that is transferred theres no changing of the physical dimension of information
611003 no i didnt actually what i think was more important was experiencing the river together so it wasnt a question of me trying to write something imitative of the photographs it was coming to my own sense of passion for the subject and what knowledge i could bring both as a fisherman and an environmentalist
611004 i wouldnt attempt to describe it because i made the picture and thats my language
611005 what i discovered in the making of this book is that there is an energy in the water thats ever changing and ever present and its solid and its liquid and its ephemeral
611006 that picture coming at it as a fisherman embodies a lot of the mystery of fishing water we think of as a medium we can see into in fact there is something impenetrable its another element
611007 leaving the curved warmth of my wife creeping burglar like through the summer kitchen of the old house in the first light i would take the river road
611008 often as not i followed jack in the rotation squinting to read the cursive illuminated text of the water as he did
611009 when biologists tested trees along pacific salmon rivers they were surprised to find traces of salmon dna in the tree tissue the trees it appeared were themselves being nourished by the salmon it was a short leap to understand that bears carried salmon into the forest where remains of the seasonal fish feast became fertilizer rising through the tree roots to the canopy we should not have been surprised to find that all life is so intimately connected that life begets life
611010 i had a small bear that i bought for my first wife as a stocking filler we called it paddington because it was our leaving station when commuting in the morning
611011 theres something about bears which sets them apart from the other toys
611012 i think dolls are always wondering what theyre going to wear next bears have this quality that children in particular feel they can tell their secrets to and they wont pass them on
611013 its quite something to create a character that lives for such a long time
611014 hes got a secret compartment in his suitcase you see

611060 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
611061 you bet your life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
611062 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
611063 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
611064 because i know what to do with gods fame with gods visibility with gods influence to jesus be the glory
611065 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
611066 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
611067 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
611068 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
611069 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players lambert ham bobby bell and many others
611070 while in my mind they were a threat to do this in their minds it was only the americans that were a threat to do it
611071 they were concerned that maybe science in the states had progressed to the point where the athletes would have access to technologies that they werent looking for so they wanted an honest appraisal of how possible that was
611072 their government had instructed them that there were going to be no chinese athletes doping at the beijing olympics
611073 they wanted the chinese athletes to be scrupulously clean they didnt want an embarrassment on the world stage their major concern was the americans which was why they were talking to me
611074 have proven to be a lot more difficult so i dont think anybody has done any successful gene doping in athletes yet
611075 this is not a trivial thing that some athlete can inject themselves in a garage
611076 it may in the end keep it out of people during the period you would be undergoing immune suppression you wouldnt be in training you would be a hospital patient
611077 just because someone will sell you stem cells does not mean that they will do anything other than make money for the person selling them it shows how people are willing to make money at the athletes expense but is not likely to help anyones performance
611078 it does reinforce my belief that when gene therapy technology is more mature someone with the correct expertise will try to market gene doping to the athletes
611079 i guess when i watch sports ever since mark mcgwire and jose canseco ive watched with a little more of a jaded eye because it was so obvious watching those guys and looking at their body profiles that they were on steroids i was so incredulous at the time that baseball was ignoring it
611080 and then knowing the amount of doping that was going on in cycling from talking to people i know who are involved in that sport and it was being ignored for so long it does make you jaded
611081 you think well the authorities dont really care and they tolerate these things until it becomes a pr problem and then they go after it and so it does change your perception of sports and it reminds you that its more a business than a sport these days
611082 you dont believe it so you just have to wonder how long it is until they figure out what the person is doing
611083 and if they dont figure out and they win the gold medal at the olympics you walk away feeling well that was cheapened
611084 theres enough money here in athletics that people are willing to help the athletes like balco
611085 if somebodys made an undetectable steroid like balco was doing without a sample of it without any clue of what theyre doing wada is not going to be able to test it for this olympics and so the person may get away with cheating
611086 so i told them they might consider developing a test for that i dont know if they did or not
611087 thats why they have developed a list of coaches they felt were suspect and would try to dope the athletes they were really cracking down on them and testing everyone who was working with them in particular even though the chinese government and the chinese testing lab want to stop it they freely admitted to me that there were chinese coaches and athletes who would try to dope if they didnt stop them
611088 we dont need to sit down we make up a game plan after weve started
611089 come the 9th of august the opening day of competition the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over
611090 certainly the issues that are playing out on the world stage have taken precedence over the games and the competition in the games
611091 if the chinese believe that the olympics failed or were badly tarnished because of foreign actions whether demonstrations or media coverage chinas reaction will be sharply negative
611092 this is perhaps the most exciting games weve ever broadcast
611093 people sometimes ask me why the hell did you give the games to beijing in 2001
611094 international olympic committee president jacques rogge said earlier this year
611095 well the pollution situation in 2001 according to the world health organizations standards was not a problem
611096 they have infused large amounts of resources behind their sports programs
611097 theyve developed incredible olympic pipelines 2008 is just the beginning
611098 as a result china russia and the united states will all vie for the top gold medal and overall medal count
611099 by hosting the beijing games we will show the world that the chinese people are a peace loving nation
611100 they are always the best fields in the game mickelson said of the wgc events which are not nearly as prestigious as the majors
611101 theyre always on great golf courses theyre always on tough tests so i think theres a lot of merit to whoever wins those
611102 you do everything you can to put yourself into position to come out of that last pit stop in position to go ahead and then you put the gloves on and go for
611103 i still think our focus is on a good solid finish
611104 when we do that on a weekly basis the wins will come its real easy to lose focus of the big picture focus a little too much on winning and then make a mistake
611105 last year at this point we were struggling just to make a race and its basically been that way for 19 months
611106 but the first race here in june was a big confidence builder knowing that we could run up front all day
611107 i know its clich to say that were better than where we are in points 40th but i really do feel that well be running among the top 10 throughout the rest of the season
611108 its tough we hit every single play if we get up at 6 oclock in the morning were hitting at 7 you have to be a man about it
611109 we get together in the huddle and just say lets go
611110 coaches get comfortable with the guy thats there they get used to what hes good at
611111 you dont just have another guy show up and throw him in there and expect him to pick up where he left off thats why were out here for a month before the season starts
611112 ne c dera pas un iota de ses droits en mati re de nucl aire

611115 he looked good and it was good to get him back out there
611116 he had an mri and the mri said he was ready to go i look forward to seeing him with the pads on today
611117 this is a big year for me personally and we have a great team
611118 i just feel like this is the year for me to establish myself as one of the elite tight ends which i feel like i am and i think my coaches feel like i am i just feel like the sky is the limit for me if i stay healthy
611119 i didnt need a rest and now im just trying to work my way back into things
611120 i feel good enough to come out here and practice i want to get my rhythm and establish a good relationship with donovan mcnabb i didnt play any preseason last year so i want to come out here and have a good preseason last year was a wasted year for me i was in and out training room missing games and i wasnt healthy until three quarters of the season and then i missed the last few games of the season everybody should take a vacation and get away but for me it was work
611121 everybody around me was saying that every year they have one person they slap the franchise tag on and they chose you i should feel positive and feel appreciative about that
611122 thats kind of what our guys said he could do for us when we picked him up
611123 he had four pitches working and he could throw them at any time thats why he had success and will continue to have success
611124 at bats like that can make or break a game if he gets a hit or drives the ball there he could give them some momentum i just wanted to make good pitches there
611125 it was nice to throw a good game not only for me personally but more importantly for the team we have two months left and we have to get wins
611126 but i feel for those guys because i know how hard it is to go through those things to bust your butt in the off season and then to get injured in training camp i know how it is
611127 he looks strong and fast and quick i think hes playing very good right now we want him to maintain that and hes going against the first team offense its a good gauge of what hes all about right now and it looks like hes doing ok
611128 its just a lot of hard work finally paying off for me
611129 hes back healthy and thats just exciting to see that because hes been through so much

611131 nascars had a long standing relationship with the urban youth racing school and its a relationship that has been built around significant support from nascar and our many partners in the industry
611132 teams drivers tracks sponsors and manufacturers have all been supportive of the uyrs over the last 10 years and that support continues today
611133 there are certain parts of their program that weve had discussions about and we certainly believe the urban youth racing school has the potential to do more in the communities where the program has been established we look forward to working with them toward getting to this result
611134 why all of a sudden is nascar telling us that theyre not getting their moneys worth from our program theyve given us 250 000 since 1999 and theyve received over 4 million in positive impressions in the media
611135 theres no one on the planet when it comes to inner city kids who has diversified nascar more than i have
611136 ninety percent of the kids coming into our program know nothing about nascar but our curriculum teaches them about the sport as well as the career opportunities in nascar and they go back to their neighborhoods and share that experience with their friends and families what more could nascar want from me we are real when it comes to diversifying nascar
611137 were trying to create pathways that are realistic for these kids to get into the sport and nascar asks how many of our kids are actually working in the industry
611138 but in order for that to happen there have to be opportunities and once theyre there are they going to be mistreated or deal with racism you have to be open as an industry to really let people in
611139 i was 12 years old when i started at the uyrs and all i wanted to do was race that was the magnet that drew me in
611140 but then i actually did really well in the classroom and saw how many opportunities are out there working with gibbs is a once in a lifetime experience that you cant put a price on
611141 the uyrs is doing its part through an evolving learning process and emerging data suggests theyre having some success
611142 combine a chance for open dialogue with learning about math engineering science and technology while racing go karts the change in attitude toward education is magical
611143 weve been associated with the urban youth racing school for at least a decade and that includes participating in their annual banquet
611144 its very rewarding to see the enthusiasm on the kids faces as we go through the awards ceremony their genuine love of the program is very cool to experience
611145 hes been a guy who has needed a little adjustment time as he has moved up levels
611146 we wanted to get him to triple a and have him make his adjustments in august rather than out of spring training next year
611147 weve got some guys who think hes a three or a four
611148 i think he can be better than that i think guys mature people forget hes only 21 and with maturity he could get better i think he could be a legitimate no 2
611149 im working on about two hours sleep but i feel great
611150 we had more players out for the spring than we had on the team last fall we wont be relying on freshmen as much
611151 its eye opening to get back to running and to get back in the pocket
611152 i just continued to throw my arm is probably stronger than its been and my timing is down
611153 our main focus is to find a tailback who wants to carry the ball 20 times a game and who separates himself from the group
611154 and on the offensive line are we tough enough are we rugged enough are we united on the offensive line
611155 we want to be the no 1 scoring defense in the conference and make an impact on special teams we know what we can do we have high expectations
611156 the bottom line is i like the way the team in coming and we need to stay hungry like every other team in the league
611157 its going to depend on how we practice as a team i believe as we progress the product will take care of itself to get the outcome we want we have to focus on execution
611158 from what happened in his last start its kind of hard to feel as confident as i was for the derby and those other races
611159 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to run his race
611160 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen today because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i have no idea
611161 but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him
611162 big brown is the story and rightfully so and we hope our horses come to play and see what happens
611163 he could be better than the big brown leading up to the kentucky derby
611164 this morning everyone got up and youve never seen so many grown men so excited
611165 it was like they were 10 years old and it was christmas
611166 we didnt try to cram something in there when we werent prepared and they werent prepared
611167 i would have definitely been part of the conspiracy if someone would have done that
611168 i thought it was good that they could all feel like they were 30 plus today
611169 i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
611170 both are highly contagious things so weve put him in a separate room and just kind of kept him away from everything
611171 i want to get him back in but i want to make sure hes healthy at the same time
611172 im anxious to get him back in there and going
611173 well just have to see how this rehab goes and how hes doing
611174 were able to work on some specific areas of the game and really focus in and slow it down and teach them and at the same time get some good film on it so we can use that also as a teaching tool
611175 its like your regular defense but just with a lot of safeties in there you have to make sure everythings straight
611176 support and defend the constitution that has been trampled time and again over the last seven years
611177 the politicization of the department of justice the misuse of signing statements the misuse of authority with regard to detention interrogation and rendition possible manipulation of intelligence regarding the iraq war improper retaliation against critics of the administration and excessive secrecy
611178 her first words were that she was very happy to see very nice people
611179 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being at heart
611180 labbiamo scelta perch lei un uomo nella media ma solo
611181 anything can happen in the middle east between now and when olmert finally steps down
611182 it could be an agreement with syria but it is rather more likely to be an israeli attack on iran hezbollah hamas or all three
611183 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
611184 i could feel his cock hitting agains the bottom of my pussy
611185 at one point i thought i was going to pass out then i realized that he still had to stick it in my ass i had to take a deep breath
611186 la interjecci n desde el punto de vista sem ntico y de la fonolog a discursiva
611187 i think its the simple things that are the sexiest like a woman in pretty strappy heels and a short dress
611188 die welt wird nicht bedroht von den menschen die das b se tun sondern von denen die zuschauen und nichts tun
611189 once my husband threw away my medication into the pit latrine
611190 he said that he did not want to see these medicines in his house
611191 eu tenho a maior grande sorte de estar com ela
611192 it would just allow so many more opportunities and would be a great gathering place for the community
611193 the funds are focused on helping people remain living in their own homes so that can mean very different things for different people
611194 wed take her to apply for a social security card but you have to have id first
611195 so you go try to get an id but you have to have a social security card first
611196 she told me that well shed stop drinking the cheapest beer and drink better beer so she wouldnt feel so bad finally i got her to agree to only have one in the morning and she stuck with it
611197 there is definitely going to be a period of adjustment
611198 there will be some rough patches were going to give debra every chance to succeed
611199 i promise i wont let yall down i got myself a home
611200 i do not think the central florida commuter rail project is in the best interest of our citizens financially
611201 if we lose providers which we could well have an access issue especially in rural areas were telling our providers to be prepared
611202 its a back door rate cut for all hospices across the country
611203 you combine a 4 6 percent cut in rates with a 3 4 percent margin and thats a prescription to drive many hospices out of business
611204 so its baffling to the hospice community that the administration is proposing to cut the rates of a cost effective high quality end of life care sector
611205 at the same time all our other costs are going up
611206 so if you give a modest increase in wages and youre losing 4 percent thats an 8 percent shift
611207 were constantly looking for ways to be more cost effective
611208 already what weve got are reimbursement rates that havent kept up with inflation
611209 you add in travel costs its a really bad situation
611210 were really going to keep the pressure on were not going to give up
611211 we dont need to sit down we make up a game plan after weve started
611212 you realize very quickly he has a good idea what hes doing his feel for it is impressive
611213 he understands whats going on he knows how to catch
611214 they started midway through my career so i havent given them the priority like i do a major or care about like a major
611215 but they are always the best fields in the game theyre always on great golf courses theyre always on tough tests so i think theres a lot of merit to whoever wins those
611216 at over 70 mph there was just so much spray
611217 all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were
611218 in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning
611219 i hit a lapped car with no brake lights i have no idea who it was
611220 i couldnt see 5 feet in front of me down the straightaway under caution somebody stopped i locked up all four and boom its just not right
611221 it was fun but its not good to see guys wrecking under yellow
611222 you know from what happened in his last start its kind of hard for me to feel as confident as i was for the derby and his other races but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to go out there and run his race
611223 i felt that for the belmont and something went wrong
611224 if big brown finishes here the right way im going to forget about trying to figure it out
611225 whatever happened in that race i dont have an idea but if it happens again im going to know something is wrong with him
611226 you know if he wasnt going into this race as good as he could go into a race we would wait on the next spot its not like an emergency that we would run him in this race
611227 my direct appeal is for every employer in australia when the government delivers and when the aboriginal leaders and the aboriginals themselves deliver work mentor ready aboriginal people to you to employ we ask you to step out to your major role your major part in breaking at last the aboriginal social and monetary poverty cycle and employ these aboriginals
611228 a three to four month short course which is crammed with the industry details specific to that aboriginals future job is what has always been required and what the government is promising to deliver
611229 thats why we need a strong partnership between indigenous leadership our major companies as well as the government itself supporting this plan on the way through
611230 whether youre in aurukun or youre in hopedale youre out in the sticks
611231 we can do the welfare reform to push our people into real work but the bit i could not ever muscle together was the work opportunity part of the jigsaw
611232 and so it was a complete hit to the solar plexus when andrew proposed not a few thousand real jobs in a timeframe but 50 000 guaranteed real jobs
611233 judges will have the discretion to impose the maximum sentence on criminals who commit the worst crimes
611234 three mates two clubs five knockbacks one punch up to 10 years in jail
611235 we expect the prison population will grow with serious offenders at the worst end of the scale thats where the pressure will come
611236 this was an issue that needed to be resolved were not looking at an election context
611237 it was an issue which with the recent court of appeal decision we had to act on weve moved expeditiously
611238 believe me its a real talking point in the prison this truth in sentencing in particular
611239 i think if it had of been brought in a long long time ago there would be a lot of people walking around now quite a lot
611240 the last thing i ever want to do is to make this issue political its not a political issue its a community issue
611241 one huge step for peace israel withdraw from the occupied territories
611242 it wont be perfect this first preseason game but we have several to get up to speed
611243 the preseason games you dont put a lot of stock in
611244 i think its an effective tool having that ability to get the call in in real time
611245 it alleviates some of the time it takes to get a call but they do turn it off 15 seconds before the play clock expires
611246 today we have absolutely no concerns about the organization no regrets come the 9th of august the opening day of competition the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over
611247 im not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for
611248 we are not running the internet in china chinese authorities are running the internet in china
611249 if we allow political propaganda its the end of the harmony of the olympic village and the end of the harmony of the games
611250 these are 17 cheats that will not falsify the competition
611251 i thought he didnt like to be called pacman anymore you said pacman pacman jones
611252 i thought he didnt want to be called pacman anymore
611253 can i tell you today at the expense of sounding real self righteous i belong here i belong here i belong here i belong here because i know what to do with it i know what to do with gods fame with gods dollars with gods visibility gods influence and relationships i know what to do with it
611254 getting here did not come without controversy as im sure it did with some of the guys sitting behind me but through it all im here with a greater appreciation for something that not every player is able to achieve and for people who stood up for me and spoke out in my behalf im extremely honored to be included with this group of elite athletes and to do so with the class of 2008 i will wear the banner with pride and i will represent it well thank you
611255 the last 43 years of my life involved with the nfl have taught me through faith hard work determination willingness to get somewhere to a better life i should have a chance to rise from the most modest circumstances and become a hall of famer just like this old undrafted free agent country boy from angleton texas
611256 to the young kids out there i am proof you should do everything you can to live your dream whatever that may be i did not have the material advantages but through commitment to achieving my goals using the advantages that i did have and listening to the wise men and women who offered their support i was able to live my dream this was my dream
611257 i think the discussions are moving ahead and i hope we have something resolved by monday i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
611258 what smith did was wrong and we take very serious and he is being punished severely for it
611259 i think it is clear that we have an issue here and something is wrong with the system flawed with the system and we have to address it
611260 i think its a disservice when players arent in camp and being paid properly
611261 i do like our current quarterbacks chad pennington and kellen clemens from almost any aspect
611262 when you see these two gentleman im so happy to have them on the team i think theyre capable of taking us where we have to go
611263 how can i sit on the couch and get somebody to come stuff my pie hole with processed chemical laden food so that i dont miss anything on the boob toob
611264 unix ms dos and windows nt also known as the good the bad and the ugly
611265 they were left with some financial debt so they really have a motive to run around the world
611266 they come right out of the 60s to a lot of people it looks almost like theyre from a different planet
611267 la dicha de vivir consiste en tener siempre alguien a quien amar algo que hacer y algo que esperar
611268 estamos pasando por un momento complicado pero no debemos rendirnos

611275 it was an ugly scene with blood everywhere i could not count the dead i just glanced at once and i ran away for my life
611276 i guess the house gets the guns and we get the knives and we all go into a room and fight it out
611277 theres anchorage with some crisis and rural alaska with an unprecedented crisis
611278 this is what im thinking i want to expand teds house
611279 it discusses active criminal grand jury investigations and similar matters
611280 pretty soon im out of the shop im doing all of bills hotshotting
611281 i took a crew out there and we cleaned up
611282 she was telling me lets get that out of there and that out of there
611283 i know she didnt get a bill i know because i was running the paperwork
611284 he was checking on it and he brought rocky williams out and allen goes we need to talk
611285 me and rocky started talking about it why dont we just jack the house up which is what we did
611286 ted had actually wanted to retire a few years ago and catherine never liked the original place
611287 i had to go in to girdwood and i found these rustic hippy tree cutters to come out there and cut that tree down that was a big deal cutting that tree down so that it didnt fall on the cabin
611288 it was fairly spendy that was a big tree but veco not stevens paid for it
611289 john hess comes out meets with me meets with rocky and we started walking around looking at stuff kicking it around how in the hell are we gonna do this
611290 it was me rocky and bob persons and we were putting in floor joists
611291 as a practical matter i will tell you we paid every bill that was given to us
611292 every bill that was sent to us has been paid personally with our own money and thats all there is to it its our own money
611293 this is a sad portion of my life it will take time to explain
611294 catherine and i personally paid over 130 000 for the improvements to our chalet in girdwood someone or more than one keeps telling the fbi thats not so takes time to go back over five years to prove they are wrong
611295 did not include the labor costs of veco employees and contractors and did not include the costs of materials provided by veco
611296 installed electrical plumbing framing heating and flooring materials in the girdwood residence
611297 i know because i ran the paperwork i did all the purchase orders
611298 hes a welder he knows how to design he knew everybody at the fab shop
611299 w eve never worked with a man so easy to get along with as name of a veco employee plus everyone whos seen the place wants to know who has done the things hes done you and person a have been the spark plugs and we are really pleased with all you have done hope to see you and the chalet soon
611300 so she picked out the carpet she picked out the tile
611301 she made it her place and that was what ted wanted because i dont think he planned to be in politics at this point in time
611302 usually catherine would come by ted didnt come by that much
611303 catherine called me and said my god weve got to get this stopped i had to drive out to girdwood and fix it
611304 but were seeing signs that the ice concentration is dropping there now
611305 that plug could very well melt out in the next few weeks
611306 in other words its not looking like its going to break last years record minimum but were well below normal
611307 its one of those cases where im glad to say were wrong
611308 theres not many people using it said bicyclist janice tower
611309 its a big public policy issue but theres no entity now that is going to bring that all together
611310 its a city problem well yes but no its a state wildlife problem but fish and game will say thats a law enforcement problem
611311 guidelines for maintaining bear habitat while reducing bear human conflicts in the municipality of anchorage and chugach state park
611312 its all about policy value arguments said john hechtel a respected bear biologist now retired from fish and game
611313 nobody ever agrees on how many bears are enough or how many salmon is a right number
611314 people have been struggling with this for years there are ways you can try to optimize the situation
611315 but you cant just shoot the bears because more bears will just move in
611316 the real source of the bears is the chugach state park
611317 i know the committee has talked about coming up with a bear plan the way we came up with a goose reduction plan but whos the agency responsible for the bears
611318 i hike there in bicentennial park every night he said
611319 i do know there is some risk in going out there i hiked with some trepidation after the davis incident
611320 weve known about the bear population for a long time
611321 were a society that wants to know about risks we accept certain risks but risk is an individual issue
611322 but what about all the people who dont know about bears
611323 we have been having internal discussions on that dillon said
611324 but weve been doing that for years its an ongoing process
611325 i cant tell you who leads i dont think there is a single leader
611326 die westliche zivilisation f hrt mit berschallgeschwindigkeit auf den abgrund zu und wir beschreiben das im ironisch sarkastischen ton
611327 ich konnte beim dreh die eigenen gef hle nutzen weil ich genau wusste wie sich dieser konflikt anf hlt
611328 als wir lter wurden haben wir uns einander angen hert
611329 man hat es doch selbst in der hand die eigenen ziele zu verfolgen

611548 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
611549 i never knew tim and his family but i wish all the best in this awful time
611550 the outpouring of well wishes from complete strangers has been overwhelming
611551 the family appreciates all the love and support from friends loved ones and the public nationwide
611552 as soon as the complaint was filed the buck passing began
611553 getting information out of the police is about as difficult as getting information out of stalinist russia
611554 most of the complaints that ive brought to the police just disappear
611555 i did the first check to see if jeff had contact with police and because if im going to deal with this guy i want to make sure i know who he is from an officer safety standpoint
611556 not suspected of any wrongdoing and no further action will be taken in this matter
611557 evidence indicates that lakey conducted computerized queries that were unrelated to the performance of his duties based on all the available information there is evidence of misconduct
611558 weary titan staggering under the too vast orb of its own fate
611559 believe me my young friend there is nothing absolutely nothing half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats
611560 theyre all right in a way im very good friends with them pass the time of day when we meet and all that but they break out sometimes theres no denying it and then well you cant really trust them and thats a fact
611561 like the urban mob anarchists of every edwardian upper middle class nightmare
611562 what is one to say to an act of destructive ferocity so absurd as to be incomprehensible inexplicable almost unthinkable in fact mad
611563 one single amiable weakness the idealistic belief in being loved for himself
611564 they all agreed that in some unaccountable way the place reminded them of their boyhood
611565 god forbid that madness should in any way interrupt friendship
611566 ive been leaving my bike not wanting to head out into the storms weve been having for the past 10 days every bit of lightning every plane overhead i look even though im a rational person a journalist you still look and hear the sounds again
611567 you could hear the thunder getting closer we were counting the time from lightning to thunder three seconds two seconds one second it sounded like a bomb an explosion i felt it was in my head right there our tent is orange and the light coming in was orange but there was a bright white light and flashes of blue
611568 it sounds like the most fundamental thing exactly why lightning goes to the ground why most of it stays in the clouds
611569 you cant be in all parts of the cloud at the same time and clouds change so rapidly
611570 were trying to understand why each step should make x rays which are associated with lightning propagation
611571 when you have that tingling feeling when your hair is standing up there is a flow of positive charges streaming up to meet that negative charge
611572 we can see right down to the millisecond where it is occurring
611573 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
611574 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
611575 it was felt at the time that it was a permitted use
611576 our position is that we have not made any other such use of the personal information and have no intention of doing so again
611577 my mother says im a carnival baby that means she conceived me in carnival time
611578 what is shocking is that even for berliners it is difficult to tell whether you are standing in the east or west part of the city even we ourselves have difficulty saying where the wall stood
611579 we should not be surprised because in the 1990s everybody wanted all traces to disappear we knew berlin would be the laboratory for german unity so the priority was to put the pieces back together in every way possible
611580 we were late in realizing that some of the wall needed to stay because a new generation now has grown up with no personal experience of what it was to live in the divided city but now we know it and we are determined to get the balance right by properly preserving what we have left
611581 it is a very difficult situation balancing the impulse to renew the city against the impulse to keep intact a barrier that was hated by so many germans
611582 we have to admit there is tension because the sheer success in remaking berlin as one city has erased much of that history
611583 but there is a strong recognition now of the need to tell our own young people about the wall what it was and what it felt like to live behind it we are planning a big year of celebrations in 2009 that will reflect that
611584 immense difficulty finding traces of the once all pervasive conflict
611585 an officer told me that i was from outside of beijing
611586 he said its written in the regulations that applications from places outside beijing will not be allowed
611587 we definitely will look into it and thats for sure
611588 im not a fit person and ive had no rest for two days
611589 four public security police from suzhou turned up they asked me to go with them
611590 i said i want to sleep i want to go back home and besides youve already taken notes
611591 we had read about the protest zones on the internet and in the newspapers and saw it on cctv chinas multi channel government run tv network
611592 demonstrations carried out in a peaceful way are simply a way of expressing ones opinion
611593 but some officials and bureaucrats think this sort of thing is dangerous they believe its shameful for people to demonstrate they think it will cause the government to lose face
611594 if the olympics end and there hasnt been a single demonstration here
611595 this is the public gate the media are not allowed to use it
611596 you must go to the south entrance the media gate
611597 yes but youre not on the media bus you have to be on the bus to go through the gate
611598 no you can only get on the media bus back at the media centre
611599 if you have a girlfriend or wife that is more successful than you ie earns more money than you i assume would you feel down or ashamed would you leave your girlfriend spouse just because of that
611600 a coalition service member was killed and another wounded when their convoy struck an ied
611601 even at this increased distance from the final i am more angry
611602 i think the referee blew against us he was partial to say the least
611603 he did not show the spaniards a red card and he did not give us a handball decision
611604 then right before the end we had a chance and he just blew in my opinion there was something wrong with him
611605 it was very important for us to win as visitors
611606 we defeated one of the best teams in the country despite their current position
611607 im so excited this is a brilliant opportunity for me as ive done lots of theatre but not much tv everyone at emmerdale has been so warm and welcoming its such a well established show and i cant wait to see what leyla gets up to
611608 rokhsaneh is a terrific actress and an exciting new addition to the cast leylas going to have some fun stirring up the factory
611609 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
611610 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
611611 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
611612 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
611613 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
611614 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
611615 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
611616 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
611617 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
611618 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
611619 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
611620 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
611621 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
611622 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
611623 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
611624 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
611625 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
611626 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
611627 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
611628 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
611629 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
611630 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
611631 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
611632 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
611633 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
611634 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
611635 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
611636 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
611637 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
611638 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
611639 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
611640 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
611641 its the tip of the iceberg these are open ocean animals for every one we find dead there are probably many others that are out there
611642 would you be interested in doing the interview strictly on africa its an area of great interest to my heart it gets such little coverage and i think we might actually reach some potential volunteers to help among the mercs readership
611643 i got my start because i learned english at the peace corps
611644 and this has been one of the most arduous processes ive had to endure
611645 meaning they werent testing messages to see what was effective
611646 we want them to make sound policy decisions not poll driven decisions
611647 we want to make sure that were not in an echo chamber
611648 im going to work hard on foster care issues throughout my term because theres a lot of work to be done
611649 we are getting frustrated because no one is caring about kids and that is what we are thinking about
611650 if we dont reach agreement then we wont take it off the ballot
611651 if this tax passes most of the residential development in north san jose wont happen
611652 certainly anytime you go to the ballot theres a risk but were pretty confident that well get the support
611653 a great honor and privilege a chance to show the world how far theyve come
611654 it will bring a lot of world leaders and dignitaries to beijing and they can see how it is today
611655 even people i work with other physicians still think china looks like what they see in the movies
611656 the olympics have become a disaster because they bulldozed peoples houses and created this fake boom
611657 maybe the olympics will bring china a good image to the world but these goddamn games have made people commit suicide
611658 i dont like to see the olympics used as an excuse for the chinese communist party to persecute people
611659 im concerned that the olympics are being used as a propaganda tool
611660 i dont think making a mockery of the country is the way to go
611661 if you just keep pounding the government theyll just tighten up their security
611662 the torch run protests just gave the government a darn good reason to do that
611663 im proud that china is doing everything it can to make the olympics the best they can be
611664 i think the whole world is very excited about it
611665 it was amazing that four of us couples were married that year because it was such a tumultuous year
611666 who went in to the delivery room when the first child was born
611667 you just have to lean on each other and do the best you can
611668 the hope of youth is being replaced by the reality of age
611669 this case is on track to be the largest in terms of discovery in the history of civil litigation
611670 to keep prices high to stifle competition and to eliminate consumer choice
611671 as a matter of policy hp cooperates with governmental legal and regulatory authorities whenever it is appropriate and possible for us to do so
611672 we believe that the damages will be in the billions of dollars
611673 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
611674 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
611675 the pattern and string of attacks has been escalating against the research and science community here as well as at other university of california campuses
611676 unconscionable that any person would commit this act of cowardice and terrorize individuals in the name of animal rights
611677 in whatever meetings we take part and whatever issue we raise the main aim is institutionalizing our nuclear rights
611678 the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights in this regard
611679 mommy i love my fingers mommy i love my toes mommy i love you
611680 the sport would not survive today if drivers were being killed at the rate they were in the 1960s and 70s it would have been taken off the air it is beamed into peoples living rooms on sunday afternoons with children watching

611692 despite the negative pace of sales across the industry audi continues to outperform the market
611693 theres been positive consumer reaction to our products and there is a growing enthusiasm for the forthcoming launch of the all new a4 in addition to the beautiful vehicles and the excellent technology i think consumers are finding that audi offers a portfolio of german engineered vehicles that deliver strong fuel economy performance

611696 im in a great frame of mind why wouldnt i be im with a new team a great bunch of guys im looking forward to getting this season on the road and actually looking forward to going into next week and try to put everything together as a team and as an offense
611697 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better
611698 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
611699 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true

611744 i love this store i feel so good coming in here

611747 we had it in a good position but we just gave it up tonight
611748 we were in the ninth with our closer but we just had a bad night
611749 i thought it was going to be the turning point
611750 today i had one kind of tough inning and made some very subtle changes
611751 maybe it was simply just getting ahead of more hitters but from that point on it was a nice day to pitch
611752 i just needed one more break but no 14 isnt bad is it
611753 the game of football is a steady as you go
611754 look at the giants story last year any team can win
611755 based on what we look like on paper im very optimistic im very confident in eric and mike
611756 he has to build the team the way he sees it most efficient like in any situation like this favre you cant discuss it publicly
611757 i can tell you that i do like our current quarterbacks chad pennington and kellen clemens they can take us where we have to go
611758 pennington is accurate and very smart and when hes healthy doesnt throw picks
611759 i could say that wasnt characteristic of chad last year
611760 were going to be as receptive to anything the fans say we know were not going to make everybody happy and thats disappointing
611761 hey games on the line we have a lot of trust in this guy that hes gonna put us in position to win the game
611762 look this isnt you this isnt what you do pull it together and get back on track cause you can do whatever you want to do
611763 the first two months when i was in the starting rotation i was pitching really well
611764 but when they moved me to the pen i really took a step back i got away from everything i was working on with swb pitching coach rafael chaves and then started trying to throw harder it really made the last year and a half a waste
611765 they did it at a time where they were sure no one was going to pick me up because i had struggled so much
611766 its a business i didnt pitch well enough its tough for me but when you dont do well that stuff happens
611767 i talked to chaves about that and said that this is my fault
611768 i hit the panic button im down here with trenton pitching coach scott aldred and im throwing a lot of sinkers and a lot of changeups
611769 i know i have good enough stuff to be in the big leagues when i pitch like that now i just have to do it
611770 ive got to do what i can to get carlos going
611771 right now i just feel like im on timing wise its all about finding the timing
611772 im a big believer in getting guys to play as quick as possible
611773 his biggest asset is his bat im looking forward to watching him hit
611774 thats up to the coach eric mangini we get evaluated on everything every time we step inside the white lines this was just another step
611775 there were definitely some positives to build on im progressing toward where i want to be the path to get there has many different signs along the way its a work in progress but heading in the right direction
611776 kellen threw the ball right where it needed to be and there was no looking back for me
611777 the play he scored on was a really good look at how a tight end can affect a defense
611778 this gives you a lose closer look at game situations
611779 this is as close as we can get to a regular game
611780 weve got alex jason giambi and those guys but an important part of our game is to not hit too many homers
611781 i dont really worry about home runs i worry about runs
611782 you score runs a lot of different ways and thats my concern
611783 we did the things today that you hope you can do every day to win a ballgame
611784 the timing was right we played the game the right way good defense pitching youre not going to be able to do all those things every day but today we did
611785 we just felt that the day off and reevaluate him today it might be helpful he was swinging the bat so great and i think its affecting him a little bit
611786 you just take it day by day or week by week but hopefully we have him back for october
611787 i was a little nervous but up six runs i just tried to get them to hit the ball to somebody
611788 this is the kind of situation we were talking about bringing him back slowly
611789 but i think my heart and souls always been here
611790 im a new yorker im here i dont rush home to turn the tv on or anything like that
611791 if the girls or my wife are watching something on tv theyll watch it and ill flip back and forth maybe even once in a while but no im looking forward to moving past all of that to where its not a central point in my life so im just a regular dude
611792 no i have a lot of people there that i really have a big affection for
611793 david wright and damion easley and marlon anderson and those guys aaron heilman
611794 listen i led that team back to where it is today you dont just let that go obviously i want them to do well because thats the team that ive lived and died with for the last three years that doesnt change anything
611795 its just great to see him but thats really all i can say
611796 im just going to just ride off into the sunset
611797 you want them to kick you out and i guess they did
611798 im signing it but i wasnt a part of it it feels strange man i want to be a part of that you want to feel like you have some ownership of that when you sign that its almost like when im signing it im not able to look somebody in the eye im looking away
611799 i talked to sammy a couple of times and you can tell hes desperate for it not desperate hes hungry for it
611800 he has a strong thirst for being a champion thats why a lot of us signed here this offseason
611801 it depends what kind of pulse that bloods been pumped with
611802 they got that hunger and that itch probably a little bit more than some other guys
611803 i think it would be hard to go to a team that just won the super bowl ring and everybodys got one and when youre around everybody you got to put your hands in your pockets
611804 i wanted to starve myself of that feeling because im hungry to get it as well
611805 we got to get another one i want in theres like this great club of guys and i love em to death we all have the same desire i dont know if its as strong as it was a year ago but i hope so
611806 i see the joy on these guys faces i see the pride that they have when they go out on the field and i want to have that feel ing
611807 these guys worked real hard last year they deserved what they got it was their time to shine it was a special moment for them and they deserved to share that special moment together it always helps to add hunger to your team but the bottom line is that hunger has to translate onto the field
611808 for us its usually a low key day for family and friends but baseball players are your family and to be with them meant a lot
611809 i was here once before on august 2 and had thought it would be too hard but the media and the fans are so great this is where i belong
611810 im always taken back by how they never forget him this was wonderful im sure thurman was looking down smiling
611811 great target great presentation makes every pitch look like it was right where i wanted to throw it even if it was a foot and a half off the target
611812 obviously i would like it to stay part of the yankee lore
611813 but i am grateful of mr steinbrenner leaving it there for 29 years i understand derek jeter who dresses one locker over is very protective of it which touches me
611814 twenty nine years is the biggest tribute you could ever ask for so whatever they do will be fine
611815 hes been fighting through it and we just felt a day off and then well re evaluate him tomorrow might be helpful
611816 he was swinging the bat so great and i think its affecting him a little bit
611817 cano who has been wearing a wrap on his hand at times since sunday night said he has not had x rays
611818 i hope im only going to be out for like two three days
611819 i dont know why theyre doing this moving right next door
611820 it will be a shame to see this building go because you wont be able to walk down the runway and think babe and lou and those guys
611821 there are going to be new people to look back on and revered but it certainly will be different
611822 the first time i walked out here as a yankee player i was in awe i walked right out to the monuments you know what was the big thing for me in my tenure of playing here once a year they would put up all the pennants and championship flags and we played under that atmosphere
611823 i think what youre going to get next year will be better than anything ever seen in baseball i dont look behind if you spend your life looking behind you youre wasting your time
611824 it was like a balloon busting and we were inside the balloon
611825 to tell the truth i havent thought about that too much
611826 i havent sat back in my rocking chair to think about all that
611827 after last year i didnt know where i was going to be come aug 1 this year
611828 it was a big deal to go out and win this game today
611829 guys looked like they were in it today like everybody who put on the uniform thought this was an important game
611830 weve had a very tough homestand and we lose a very tough game 1 0 this was real important for us were chasing people and we need to win games
611831 the second inning was just a ground ball single to right a fly ball down the rightfield line that bounced in the seats and a double play ball that we didnt turn
611832 it turned out to be a great day after it looked like it was going to be really ugly
611833 but its not yankee stadium i dont think theyre going to have as much success in that one as they did in this one
611834 i was like what the hells going on its not like i stunk it up last year its frustrating because i know i can still pitch i can still be productive out there but you know the days going to come im not going to officially retire ill just ride off into the sunset
611835 its kind of sad you know because its such a great offensive team here and you hate to see a team you grew up loving struggle like they are
611836 if you dont have pitching youre not going to win i dont care if you have an all star lineup which they do theyve got to find a solution when it comes to pitching if you dont get that solidified youre going to go down the drain quick
611837 that was the first time i saw it since i pitched it
611838 strange since it was the greatest thing that ever happened to me it was pretty cool i got goose bumps watching it
611839 lookee lookee the mets fans are going home wait a minute wait a minute its not over yet
611840 boy what a bunch of front running fans theyre a first place team arent they
611841 he sounded like a guy who was jealous that there were more mets fans than marlins fans
611842 in my 12 years as a broadcaster i have been as critical of marlins fans for not showing up if not more than anything ive ever said about mets fans
611843 the beauty of the south florida market is we do have a mix of all kinds of fans
611844 i dont like it when people say south florida is not a great baseball market i think it is we have a developing marlins fan base
611845 mets fans bring out the best in the marlins fans the more people here the more exciting for us
611846 but having been a player i feel for the marlins players
611847 everybody knows i am a mets fan first and a marlins fan second
611848 but i dont interview mets players on my show i dont spend a lot of time talking about the mets on my show if the marlins are not playing the mets i dont bring mets guests on i dont think i am doing south florida a disservice hey i talk baseball every day not the dolphins
611849 ill let you know im a mets fan but im not anti marlins
611850 the job of a radio host is to portray who they are how they got to where they are who theyre a fan of and to be honest
611851 he said adding that he has read comments on internet message boards from fans making fun of his brooklyn accent
611852 instead of enjoying the fact you have two good baseball teams it turns into go back to new york i thought the civil war was over
611853 its great that we have two talented people who come from two different schools
611854 we need more people to pay attention to baseball and thats what these two guys have done
611855 i walked into his office and he had a mets cap in his bookcase
611856 he was trying to hide the mets cap hes a mets fan and thats fine maybe we can play well this year and turn his allegiance over to the big fish
611857 tommy i know you are listening lets bury this thing
611858 for the first time in my life im being able to enjoy a summer with my family and friends and do things i havent been able to do since high school im looking forward to bigger and better things
611859 thats not who i am and theres no sense reacting that way
611860 im looking forward to moving past all of that to where its not the central point in my life im just a regular dude thats all
611861 there are a lot of people there that i really have a big affection for david wright damion easley and marlon anderson and aaron heilman those are my guys and a big part of me feels thats my team i led that team back to where it is today
611862 your heart and soul are with the guys you helped bring there the guys you fought and battled with for 3 1 2 years
611863 its something i will never forget it gave me goose bumps
611864 the fans have always been great to me i know that they love me and i love them
611865 the two of us have been through the same thing
611866 we were at the dinner last night and willie was very positive his oldest daughter is expecting a baby and he and gretchen seemed very up which was really great then today seeing him put the yankee uniform back on shooting the breeze with gator and winfield and baylor it was fun
611867 willie can handle it better than i could i thought he did a great job over there i watched him grow in that job it really hurt me when i watched what he was going through because that is not easy
611868 the more the prime minister exercised his power directly through number ten and whitehall the less was the influence of the cabinet which had been seen at the heart of britains democracy
611869 the cabinet has been weakened not just by the ambitions of prime ministers but by the declining quality of their colleagues today it is one of the most serious flaws in the british democratic system
611870 theatres without borders and assisting in the indo hungarian education project an initiative thats seen the education of 12 damunagar girls completely sponsored all the way to college
611871 is better spent on helping those in the slums than on rent
611872 when i met deelip and saw for myself how he was helping all these people it drew me in
611873 what i like about him is that he likes to take up challenges even those that are controversial
611874 theyd rather give it to a more established organisation one that has a business plan in place says mhaske without any grimace on his face
611875 wouldnt it be nice to get her an ornament and next year she can hang it on the tree
611876 si les lois permettent un assassin de sortir de prison et que ces m mes lois nous font ressentir de lindignation il faut les changer
611877 cet individu suscite chez tous les citoyens et aussi chez le chef du gouvernement une sensation parfaitement compr hensible de m pris mais il faut respecter la loi
611878 national will appoint a minister of infrastructure to reshape coordinate and then oversee the governments infrastructure objectives
611879 its time to take the handbrake off time to turn the growth engine on
611880 national will reign in excessive growth in the public service
611881 i think it means cuts in education cuts in health care cuts in what we spend to house needy people cuts right across the board
611882 inevitably there will be some pretty big ones that spring to mind but im not going to detail those today
611883 if were borrowing and were reckless theyre borrowing and theyre reckless
611884 oh bit of sadness but a bit of happiness as well obviously with the seats going its the start of the new life of eden park in terms of its development these seats have seen a lot of history
611885 the trust board has been extremely cooperative and weve been working as a team for the benefit of both codes at the end of the day
611886 ne c dera pas un iota de ses droits en mati re de nucl aire
611887 in terms of the examination of the medals im still awaiting formal notification of those results i know it was a lengthy process but it was one we wanted to get right
611888 i believe the only way theyll be arrested is if they make confessions i really cant see that thats going to be happening now nine months down the track
611889 im really comfortable with the way the investigation is progressing and im anticipating a positive outcome
611890 weve certainly researched the circumstances of that investigation which was both helpful and interesting
611891 you go out and perform like we did last week and the last few weeks weve been really consistent and this week we were no where near it and thats really disappointing
611892 they sit there and writhe around in agony they dont know what to do they can hardly walk
611893 it was absolutely horrific the feeling of not being able to do anything to help i dont have a gun i couldnt put it out of its misery it was hideous
611894 i had absolutely no idea that this was in their flight path because otherwise there wouldnt have been animals here and they wouldnt have flown in here anyway if theyd known
611895 after watching what happens and how easily mistakes are made i would never ever allow it again totally against it
611896 for some i think it provides the opportunity for them to see art they may not necessarily view also it elevates skateboarding art to a higher level by exhibiting it in a gallery scenario
611897 ever since its inception its been a heavily graphic culture one thats really promoted people creatively and its usually creative individuals who are drawn to the sport
611898 a lot of skateboarders of today are artists and musicians skateboarding itself is art and its always challenging what is the mainstream and skateboarders i believe are one step ahead of everyone else
611899 im a perfectionist and i just love that feeling of getting it right and consistently getting it right is really a good feeling
611900 my mum didnt want me to be lazy on the couch so she signed me up for diving lessons i thought she meant scuba diving
611901 during the training we use the training system to increase self confidence
611902 you have to be very focussed on what you do but at the same time not screw it up

611912 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in
611913 the main issue now is getting to know one another like all indigenous people that is in new zealand now
611914 if i dont say the negative things i dont think they would take serious with the aag says low
611915 the chief of the maori people is very sincere as to receive us as like a brother so we got a long road to walk together hand in hand

611920 hey guys im back took a little three year break from this whole webcomic business boy was i sleepy i see youve kept at it all this time thats pretty awesome anyways heres my link
611921 any time you engage in negative campaigning you always run the risk of it backfiring on your own campaign
611922 that said people remember negative ads candidates use them because they are effective
611923 if they can capitalize on pre existing fears the electorate has about obama or hesitations they have about him it can be an effective strategy
611924 senator obama is an impressive orator and its a lucky thing for me that people arent just choosing a motivational speaker
611925 washington is full of talented talkers and senator obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while unfortunately on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
611926 what john mccain has done in the last week has really shown the american people he doesnt want to talk about the economy or foreign policy or healthcare
611927 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
611928 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
611929 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
611930 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
611931 more than 180 palestinians from fatah were authorised to take refuge in israel twenty two of them were wounded and were hospitalised
611932 our position on principle is that we work with and aid those among the palestinians who struggle against radical islam who oppose terrorism and who favour negotiations
611933 this is why we take this position when these palestinians are in distress and asking to go to abbass headquarters in ramallah where they will participate in the struggle against hamas
611934 jessica really loves to work out and so does justin but lately it seems like thats all she is doing
611935 justin is trying to get it through to her that she can take some time out to enjoy burger and beers
611936 its not a distraction to rice but its a distraction to the other competitors because it puts a giant cross on your shoulders and they will do everything they can to bring you down the daily telegraph quoted andronicus who was a regular swimsuit cover girl during her career as saying
611937 it can backfire but i dont think its going to neck her career shes a great talent and if she wins a gold medal theyll be lining up 10 deep he said
611938 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president or mr universe
611939 victoria is terrified but shes desperate for another baby shes always wanted a ittle girl to join her three boys
611940 she wanted to try for a baby after the spice girls finished touring but shes put her plans on hold while she sees what can be done to help her
611941 she knows she is putting her health at risk if she dismisses the advice of her doctors and has another c section
611942 posh is trying to get as strong and healthy as she can be and is eating healthily to prepare herself for her next baby she wants to make sure her body is as strong as it can be shes also seeking as much medical advice as she can before she decides what to do next
611943 adding it up it must come to around a million i couldnt live in knickers id worn before and i only wear the best
611944 nothin i can do a total eclipse of the heart and the sun
611945 so turn around bright eyes and do not look directly into it
611946 the duo baard and zaetta go head to head against a corrupt company ceo and group of deadly ninja assassins
611947 weve come up with an original story that addresses relevant issues such as petrol prices media and the general direction the world is heading
611948 the ninja has been set up with a view to franchise and spin off into other mediums such as comic books and graphic novels
611949 i do have an idea im always getting these mad ideas

612016 en noviembre de 2006 un grupo de expertos norteamericanos y m s modestamente el autor de este libro enviamos m s de un centenar de informes a las naciones unidas
612017 el punto es que estad sticamente la mujer corre m s riesgo de ser asesinada por su pareja que por un extra o
612018 est reforzado por los medios de comunicaci n por la pel culas de hollywood si ves los filmes de vaqueros de ex combatientes de guerra de acci n ver s una foto del hombre violento
612019 tambi n te dicen que la del problema es ella que est loca y me provoca desgraciadamente se es el discurso que te dan
612020 dominar y explotar a la mujer lo que quiere es crear una relaci n de dominio donde los dem s porque incluye a los hijos vivan con miedo
612021 es importante que el maltratador aprenda a resolver los conflictos algunos intentan evitarlos y esto adem s de ser imposible es contraproducente
612022 en realidad no hay un perfil nico del hombre violento
612023 se podr a decir que el individuo tiene poca autoestima y por eso crea la agresi n
612024 es la imagen del m s en todo el de la mujer m s guapa el de la familia m s perfecta el mejor trabajo todo perfecto y esto es imposible lo que genera frustraciones
612025 estos hombres se exigen estar en control de sus emociones nunca se permiten sentirse a un lado estar vulnerables o tristes pero esto les ocurre y cuando no logran sobreponerse a ello entonces viene la violencia
612026 no es aceptable el no saber qu hacer pero s que es aceptable para ellos ser agresivos y lo que m s preocupa es que a corto plazo esto funciona porque acaba con la discusi n y psicol gicamente los deja m s tranquilos pero s lo a corto plazo
612027 la sociedad cambia s y la leyes tambi n cambian pero el cambio de la sociedad va m s lento que el de las legislaciones va por detr s
612028 al principio no asumen esa responsabilidad pero s que reconocen los hechos y lo que intentamos hacer es desde su relato deconstruir las excusas que te dan
612029 cuando llego a la casa ella no tiene la cena lista
612030 con este caso lo que hacemos es que vemos con l c mo durante las ocho horas que estuvo en su trabajo s que se supo controlar entonces tiene que darse cuenta que no es una cuesti n de que no se sepa controlar en general sino que se descontrola en su casa
612031 una de esas excusas t picas es la del hombre que ha tenido un d a dif cil en el trabajo el jefe le ha molestado en diversas ocasiones y
612032 algunos hombres les cuesta ver a la mujer como otro ser las conceptualizan como un objeto y les cuesta ver que la pareja es otro equivalente diferente pero igualmente v lido
612033 ese es el momento del time out tiempo fuera en el que el hombre debe dejar la discusi n y salir para tranquilizarse
612034 pero luego debe haber un compromiso para que el hombre hable sobre el problema
612035 porque es importante que el maltratador aprenda a resolver los conflictos algunos intentan evitarlos y esto adem s de ser imposible es contraproducente
612036 hay que romper con el c rculo vicioso de la violencia en el que el hombre comete una agresi n se arrepiente promete que todo va a cambiar pasa por un per odo de buena conducta de regalos y de mimos a su pareja hasta que vuelven las tensiones y comete una nueva agresi n

612085 what is your opinion on the indonesian countrz and people
612086 hey boss want t shirt big size for you cheap prize
612087 dont you think we are different from everyone else and you realised anot every 1 minute we give each other alot of small kisses
612088 we want all of this to be simple and risk to be nominal the main area in which people have difficutly is assessing their wealth and risk factors far too often we see online gaming investors jumping into a portfolio that is far too aggressive the end result can be disasterous invoking many to file bankruptcy
612089 give yourself a nice cussion of cash and retirement income
612090 personally i save about 10 each month for retirement 20 as liquid cash for everyday needs and another 40 for investing this may sound very demanding especially with regard to online gaming investments but in actuality it is really a reflection of what you want for your future not necessarily what you want now
612091 the motivation to have money from a online gaming portfolio in the future is great
612092 but dont forget that you cant live in the future forever many people fall into the trap of not meeting basic needs in the present which logically means that their future will become progressively more difficult
612093 make online gaming investments work for you and retire wealthy
612094 my top tip is making baby steps before giant leaps
612095 by starting slowly your risk factor is greatly diminished and financial commitment is much lower you can get out at any time with minimal losses or move forward into more risky online gaming areas with good fundamental knowledge
612096 were looking at the long term here quick wins are for lotteries and penny poker games not the online gaming investment market i think given enough time those who invest in this area will see good returns for their online gaming money
612097 i invest heavily in areas that look promising but also proportionately balance my risk by putting some money in standard investments such as stocks bonds and money market funds
612098 castrillo hercules talks to you about online gaming and how it can benefit you right now
612099 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
612100 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers

612103 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements
612104 restaraunts night clubs and the mall have all benefitted greatly local retail sales are up nearly 50 and restaurants have nearly all sold out for the next week and a half
612105 im so thankful that many online gaming for the greater society industry heavyweights took time out to come and talk to us ive learned a lot of new things found out industry news and was able to network successfully with others who have jobs similar to mine
612106 and eventually i want to start my own online gaming for the greater society business that will parallel my work in hollywood
612107 people are buying this online gaming for the greater society stuff like hotcakes im thrilled about the success of these products
612108 some dignitaries from england scotland france and spain also attended the online gaming for the greater society event the first of its kind world wide
612109 now that macau is beginning to attract world class casino brands our only real competition is the

612115 no you can only get on the media bus back at the media centre
612116 although chinas pursuit of olympic gold medals clearly coincides with the nations journey toward internationalization and achieving new status in the world
612117 the state driven championship mentality still reflects a combination of chinese can do and the countrys lingering inferiority complex
612118 a nation that obsesses over gold medals is not a self assured nation a government that needs gold medals to bolster nationalist sentiment and its domestic legitimacy is not a confident government and a population that cannot gracefully accept losses in sports is not a composed and secure population
612119 sports seem to bring people together regardless of their economic class political ideas or social rank
612120 given the widespread anger anxiety and frustration regarding social injustice in todays china sports as a focus of popular interest may bring about major social change if such a transformation occurs it could cause serious problems for the communist regime
612121 the injury happened in training it was very hard mentally at the beginning and i didnt know if there would be enough time for me to get ready and be fit for these olympic games
612122 but everything happened quickly and the recovery was fast my foot reacted very well to all the rehab plans that i had
612123 of course the chinese divers are the most powerful nation right now in diving despatie acknowledged
612124 but mens 3m is a very tough event and there are a lot of good divers it is going to be a good event for people to watch and a good event for us to dive in because the stakes are very high
612125 after my competitions i want to go around the markets
612126 i want to buy tons of watches ive got friends at home and told them id bring them some watches
612127 an officer told me that i was from outside of beijing
612128 he said its written in the regulations that applications from places outside beijing will not be allowed
612129 we definitely will look into it and thats for sure
612130 im not a fit person and ive had no rest for two days
612131 four public security police from suzhou turned up they asked me to go with them
612132 i said i want to sleep i want to go back home and besides youve already taken notes
612133 we had read about the protest zones on the internet and in the newspapers and saw it on cctv chinas multi channel government run tv network
612134 demonstrations carried out in a peaceful way are simply a way of expressing ones opinion
612135 but some officials and bureaucrats think this sort of thing is dangerous they believe its shameful for people to demonstrate they think it will cause the government to lose face
612136 if the olympics end and there hasnt been a single demonstration here
612137 i was in the sports centre at the university of calgary and people were like omigod whats wrong whats wrong i was like they qualified i couldnt believe it it was so surreal at first
612138 and even in a team sport you need to find your way to get ready to perform at your best that usually doesnt involve making time for other people your priorities have to be clear i understand that she understands that
612139 my eyes hit her and i was just like shes the most beautiful woman ive ever seen in my life
612140 i could always hear someone trying to catch up to me and i knew it was a guy because a girl couldnt catch up
612141 and i was like why do guys always have to beat the girl why do they always have to prove something id speed up or whatever
612142 one day i came late and so i caught up to him and we started talking and stuff i didnt realize it was him that was trying to catch up to me he tried not bad for a water athlete
612143 he puts himself out there and he knows what he wants he doesnt hide anything or tippy toe around anything thats whats impressive about him
612144 from that point on i was like it would be stupid of me to ever get rid of this guy
612145 hes very persistent but in a nonchalant way he didnt put pressure on me or anything to get into a relationship i almost came running to him after
612146 i knew quickly that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with her because shes just the most incredible person ive ever met
612147 so im sitting there and feeling down and then all of a sudden i see her coming in on crutches
612148 everything id been feeling bad for myself all that just kind of flew out the window
612149 im really looking forward to once were both done competing and we can just enjoy the games together and get all the free stuff we can possibly get and do the closing ceremonies which will be amazing
612150 the closing ceremonies will be something special and something well never forget
612151 athletes will have full rights to express themselves as they wish
612152 we are simply asking them not to get into propaganda exercises
612153 if we allow demonstrations in the village or the stadium thats the end of all harmony
612154 what he spitz did was the greatest olympic performance of all time
612155 im looking to do something different that the sport has never seen
612156 she intends to resume her swimming career as soon as possible and to again fulfil her olympic dream in 2012
612157 in water polo theres no officiating from the neck down
612158 so really anything and everything you can imagine a human being doing to another human being when no ones watching is what happens
612159 you send your message some other way in that underwater jungle that if you keep doing this ill find some way to hurt you
612160 id like to say that for the most part because youre so vulnerable and everybodys so vulnerable there is between most players an amount of mutual respect where if you hold me im going to kick you if you grab me im going to hit you but i wont go out of my way to try to hurt you
612161 but theres 30 per cent that arent that way and that means theyre going to eye gouge theyre going to get into your suit theyre gonna try to kick you in the face or elbow you in the face
612162 you can see on the video an italian player bites a guy on his nose on his nose and ends up biting a chunk out of his nose sure enough the spanish player turned around and cold cocked the italian guy and what happened he got kicked out of the game his team had to play four minutes a man down i think the spanish federation tried to send videos but nothings happened to the player
612163 i am trying to move on in my life im not a danger to women any more
612164 i dont want people to always say theres barry george he killed jill dando i want them to say theres barry george he didnt kill jill dando
612165 the police say they found lots of articles and magazines about her hoarded in my flat
612166 they actually found eight newspapers with articles on her out of about 800 newspapers there i hoard newspapers because i forget to throw them away
612167 the celebrity obsession thing was taken way out of proportion i was not obsessed with jill dando
612168 im new to the anime industry and im finally collecting now
612169 i watched bus beheader hack off body parts and eat them
612170 defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
612171 badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
612172 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
612173 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
612174 very hot when we asked them for more information bush laughed and said when we share information with your guys the bad guys always run away
612175 the question is why its taken the americans so long to see what the isi is doing
612176 weve been telling them for years but they wouldnt buy it
612177 there is no involvement by the isi of any form in afghanistan
612178 abbiamo studiato tonnellate di libri quindi non possiamo ammettere che sia tutto inutile
612179 i do like your christ i do not like your christians your christians are so unlike your christ
612180 the dying the cripple the mental the unwanted the unloved they are jesus in disguise

612186 we hebben de ganse nacht gestreden en het dorp gered
612187 after the israeli occupation refused to receive most of those who fled gaza dozens have returned and the palestinian police have taken them into custody
612188 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza
612189 in plaats van te zeggen dat we zouden verder bouwen op de verwezenlijkingen hebben we onze eigen tien jaar bestuur aangevallen
612190 we haalden voordeel uit het anti blair gevoel maar uiteindelijk accepteerden we de propaganda van onze tegenstanders en slaagden we er niet in een eigen beleidslijn naar voor schuiven
612191 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
612192 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy
612193 at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt

612196 by trying to be change he played exactly the same game the media wanted but never the game that gives us the only chance of a 4th term in office

612199 we will expel all the persons of the south side staying in the mt geumgang tourist area we deem unnecessary
612200 we will more strictly limit and control the passage of the persons and vehicles of the south side through the military demarcation line to enter the area of mt geumgang
612201 we will take strong military counter actions against even the slightest hostile actions in the tourist resort in the area of mt geumgang and the area under the military control from now on
612202 persisting in its reckless anti dprk confrontational racket after unilaterally suspending the tour of mt geumgang under the pretext of the recent case
612203 i never thought i could be in a position like this peter should get the credit for more than half of what ive done so far in this tournament
612204 i hit some of my drives to the left and right but my iron shots helped me a lot ive shot under 70 in three straight rounds so i want to do it again in the final round
612205 i was very nervous in the morning but i managed to control myself during the round
612206 fudo san hardly makes a mistake when she is in top form and it means that ill have to create chances by myself tomorrow to stand any chance of winning

612209 we have a strong team possibly equal in strength to the great team of seoul and our team of 1968
612210 this is going to be a stronger team that our team of 1988 i can predict that they will bring home more medals than we did in seoul
612211 hamdan had no previous knowledge of the operation or any other one
612212 he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars
612213 i dont think that prices will return to the record level nor will they fall below 100 per barrel
612214 what some media reported that kuwaits oil reserves are less than that is wrong and not based on scientific record on the contrary there are new discoveries
612215 i dont care if you kill me cause im not afraid of you or to die for allah and ill have a lot of wives in jennah heaven insha allah and ill be with my dad in jennah too and we will have fun doing what we want there if allah lets us

612217 mashallah thanks be to god we could all learn something from the behaviour of children sometimes they sometimes say things so basic and plain that when contemplated makes so much sense
612218 al hamdulillah thanks be to god though she knows the difference between a kaafir and a muslim some days shell stand at the window telling me shes looking at the kaafir go by other days when i speak to her about sheikh usaamah shell think about it and reply with go away kaafir and raise her hand as if to hit someone
612219 how can we say laa ilaaha illallaah there is no god but allah and allow our children to be educated and dictated by the kuffaar in school everyday
612220 with the introduction in the last few years of citizenship into the curriculum we are allowing our children to be taught that they must give allegiance to the queen and have hatred towards our great scholars and mujaahideen
612221 in english as part of gcse they must study shakespeare whose books are full of homosexuality fornication and adultery each of which are great sins in islam

612224 any time you engage in negative campaigning you always run the risk of it backfiring on your own campaign
612225 that said people remember negative ads candidates use them because they are effective
612226 if they can capitalize on pre existing fears the electorate has about obama or hesitations they have about him it can be an effective strategy
612227 senator obama is an impressive orator and its a lucky thing for me that people arent just choosing a motivational speaker
612228 washington is full of talented talkers and senator obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while unfortunately on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
612229 what john mccain has done in the last week has really shown the american people he doesnt want to talk about the economy or foreign policy or healthcare
612230 he is increasingly going to take his campaign into the gutter i think john mccain has harmed himself in the last week really eroding any capital he had built up in terms of the kind of politician he is
612231 this is another attempt by the separatist side to involve georgia in a military conflict
612232 a decision to deploy extra forces is the purview of the security council and president but in any case russia will not allow harm to come to its citizens residing in south ossetia

612237 cotton used to be king it was our no 1 crop
612238 now its all pistachios or almonds the cotton industry is slowly disappearing
612239 there is a wisdom in the natural world and hopefully we can be wise stewards of the way god planned it we dont want to upset the balance if we can get the same yields and the same quality with less inputs and its better for the environment that just makes sense
612240 a reliable supply chain is the biggest challenge in sourcing
612241 i think what we need is someone who wants to creatively invest in u s manufacturing this is about the longevity of our economy about realizing that manufacturing has to be part of the equation that it cant all be a service economy

612244 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
612245 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
612246 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
612247 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza
612248 a coalition service member was killed and another wounded when their convoy struck an ied improvised explosive device this morning in kabul
612249 thats a long ride for someone who is still a learner
612250 its going to twist the arm of many teenagers who decide im going to ride illegally
612251 the cost of training has got to go up because weve got to ride to shrewsbury so they understand the road layout so they can take their test
612252 im just worried people are not going to be able to enjoy the life on two wheels that i have
612253 i am against religion because it teaches us to be satisfied with not understanding the world
612254 the truth is that the only person i am angry with is myself i have no one else to blame but most of all i really regret hurting people not the sort of words youd expect from a dominatrix
612255 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza
612256 those found to be connected to bombings will be interrogated and brought to justice the rest will be immediately released
612257 hamas raided our family burnt our houses and terrified our children thats why we ran from gaza
612258 they hamas wanted some people from this area but we refused to hand them over
612259 they attacked the area and fired rockets and grenades at us many were killed and wounded
612260 there were gunmen firing on israeli territory the soldiers extracted them under fire we fired at the group of hamas gunmen to keep them away
612261 wir wissen noch nicht wie sich die geplante permanente immunisierung auswirkt deswegen testen wir zun chst nur an patienten die au er bluthochdruck keine anderen erkrankungen haben
612262 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
612263 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
612264 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
612265 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
612266 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
612267 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
612268 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
612269 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
612270 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
612271 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
612272 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
612273 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
612274 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
612275 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
612276 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
612277 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
612278 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
612279 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
612280 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
612281 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
612282 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
612283 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
612284 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
612285 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
612286 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
612287 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
612288 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
612289 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
612290 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
612291 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
612292 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
612293 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
612294 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
612295 according to about a dozen wal mart employees who attended such meetings in seven states wal mart executives claim that employees at unionized stores would have to pay hefty union dues while getting nothing in return and may have to go on strike without compensation also unionization could mean fewer jobs as labor costs rise
612296 voting for democratic presidential hopeful sen barack obama would be tantamount to inviting unions in
612297 opponents of relationship recognition for same sex couples often say that we have to protect children or that same sex relationships are against god
612298 gt onder de tien kilometer per uur kunnen de boetes wel wat minder daarboven steeds zwaarder en duurder naarmate de snelheid hoger wordt
612299 we believe it is personalisation plus empowerment that produces a progressive reform dynamic to put power in the hands of the individual user of public services

612310 its something thats been in our hearts for a long time
612311 our parents and grandparents have all donated to st jude
612312 i know that when someone is diagnosed with something like that they feel alone if we can just offer some encouragement even if its just taking a photo or signing an autograph then were doing our part to help them not feel so alone
612313 it was very touching to meet all of these kids and look them in the eyes
612314 even if its only for a moment it helps to take that pain away the pure joy in their eyes is possibly the coolest thing i have ever seen in my life
612315 you just got to learn that if i dont say it physically out of my mouth on camera its not true

612319 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
612320 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members

612327 if the stocks can do this well in this kind of headwind just imagine what they will do as conditions improve
612328 we have seen ridership rise 15 a year in the past two years and believe that the increase will continue and possibly accelerate
612329 we are struggling to increase capacity to meet current and expected future demand if i had two extra cars to add to each train our ridership would leap
612330 historically the aerospace market especially the business jet market has been the big growth driver at bombardier but this is changing
612331 the transportation side which comprises locomotives and rail car refurbishing as well as passenger rail cars for everything from trains and subways to trams and airport people movers is doing much better and as it continues to do so it will inevitably attract more investor interest especially for those looking for a play on passenger rail
612332 well positioned to take advantage of the robust investments in global railroad infrastructure and the worldwide growth in passenger transit
612333 just about every factor has played in our favor over the past four years
612334 intermodal has been and will continue to be the biggest growth engine
612335 the industry has got costs under control margins are strong and we have capital to invest i believe the next 20 years will be a golden age for rails

612392 my breast are small and humble so you dont confuse them with mountains
612393 no no no i mean what motivates you to wake up each morning if you just seem wasting through this life
612394 oh well that is a good question jacob if i had to make any sense of it all id say maybe it was about time i started looking at life not so much watching life do you remember when everyone was up in turmoil because of all those deaths
612395 oh sure who wouldnt remember such an event it turned our lives around
612396 did it now i guess it did i guess it changed everything from what it might have been to what it really had been all along life is short jacob life is too short to worry about where we are going or how we are getting there
612397 wait what about advancements and technology you dont think we should spend time caring about these things for future generations
612398 i do i do but that is not what i meant at all i was talking more about love jacob love the kind you fight over the kind that makes you do stupid things like speed down the road with your t tops down or try and balance your body over a side of something fall down and break a bone because it was all worth her wonderful smile or that sweet laugh
612399 nah i loved my wife dearly and i miss her every day i am stuck alive but she is not the love i had she was the love i found
612400 i suppose this city should know what it is like to understand love
612401 as confused as i just got who called it off
612402 it is not about who called if off its why it was called off
612403 so what ended it if all these things were there but you still loved one another
612404 of course youve heard how love is all you need but it is nowhere near being true we had love we had a ton of it but i cheated on her i walked outside went to our local supermarket found a woman well i didnt find her it just so happen i met her there one thing lead to another and we rented a hotel room you get the picture
612405 just like that you had all that and you cheated on the love of your life
612406 no it was my moment it was what i had to do in my life i could not walk away from it i couldnt deny what i had been shown that day where life took me i could have said it was because of our consent bickering or our playful yet truthful bantering that persuaded me to listen against my heart but it just was not a second thought to me
612407 i didnt feel persuaded i thought it made sense with susanna
612408 but but you said she wasnt the love of your life that she was the love you had found in life
612409 should it make her any less special should i be perfectly happy with a love i found or a love that may have and where i still do believe was the love of my life or must i conform to how people see things
612410 you are free to live how you please it is because people fought for that right you should enjoy your choices right or wrong
612411 you said rights fought and what we have hahahaha oh man thanks i needed that
612412 first of all they are privileges bestowed down upon us by our government whom by at any point can take them away from you secondly if i were in any other country i would have the same freedoms i do here
612413 that is not true at all there are many countries that make it so you are guilty before proven innocent
612414 and being held without bail is showing someones innocence here come on you are what twenty twenty three

612416 i did sir and i would like to finish getting your perspectives on how you changed life for all that are here yet you cant stand being here
612417 alone thats where i see life now it was when all became truth in my eyes blinded by old hate dismissal of lies humanitys words that were bound by convoluted purpose i just found food tasteless water dry even birds forgot how to sing in key around me i decided to cover my ears in broken hopes powerful walls built of rage wasted over in dismay my perspective on how i changed life was long forgotten when it all became integrated with dr can eat my ass and his adjusted psychological studies in perusing harmony through heresy being who i am and knowing what i was are nothing of similarities when i first began leaving those vultures you had not even been born yet after my wife died i knew they didnt care about pushing boundaries they wanted fountains of gold liquid to cover rotting tongues soiled minds and whatever else could have been corrupted in my absence you want perspective think about what you fear to lose and think about what is real if you end up thinking everything you fear losing is in your real pile you might have to go back to bed for a few more days you see me here sad maybe even miserable but i am content with life i know where it will go when i die for me at least i have no sense of loss anymore i lost my only real love in life over petty things i no longer am petty of those things if one day i had found her again i am sure things would have been different but as far as i know she has been long dead and forgotten all about me just remember one thing kid always cherish that which can be truly loss and fear not tomorrow of that loss i am off to take an old mans nap but i hope this will help your newspaper sell some issues from my pounds of issues

612452 i did not find any american bishop who was unable to accept the idea of covenant
612453 i think that there is a strand amongst us that is not necessarily going to be happy about it
612454 part of the sacrifice most american bishops are willing to make is that we will accept a covenant and accept the moratoria
612455 the main perpetuators of the incursions are not present so its difficult for me to make an agreement on moratoria on that basis
612456 the main reason i am committed to continuing blessings is because its a justice issue

612482 we are extremely excited to have joe in our organization the 155 pound division in the mfc is becoming one of the most exciting anywhere and mr heiland is going to make it even more exciting i cant wait
612483 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
612484 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
612485 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
612486 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
612487 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
612488 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
612489 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
612490 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
612491 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
612492 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
612493 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
612494 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

612501 we have an issue here something is wrong with the system and we have to address it
612502 i think it would be better for the players the teams and most important for the fans i think its a disservice when players arent in camp
612503 ive always said hes one of the better athletes on this team probably the top five athletes on this team
612504 any team can look good on paper you cant really worry about that
612505 we like being the underdog when youre the underdog youve got something to prove
612506 were happy where were at were happy with our team

612511 make the plays youre supposed to make man you cant afford to give away outs this game is intended for 27 outs not 29 or 30 if you dont play defense or dont make a couple plays youre supposed to you are actually playing 10 or 10 1 3 innings to my nine
612512 its not something i want to go through every summer but i think it will help us deal with future bumps in the road
612513 i know guys who might see their aunts and uncles only once a year because families are so spread out
612514 its something i like to do i like playing and answering their questions
612515 all the men in our house are hurt right now
612516 when i was a kid i even wanted to be a real estate agent like him
612517 i was 16 years old stubborn and not getting my way
612518 i told steve keep your mouth shut and if you have to vent vent to me
612519 my dad used to tell me you have all the talent in the world just dont screw it up
612520 going through what i did that first year in london helped prepare me for hard times
612521 last summer i was on the ice two or three times a week
612522 last year i just wanted to have the best camp possible this year i want to force them to make a tough decision
612523 shilpa and i were to co host bigg boss and after being inmates at bigg boss and celebrity big brother wed have made a nice pair but unfortunately this film where i play a psycho required immense preparation
612524 my character is like many animals rolled into one sometimes he is a hyena sometimes he becomes a rabbit i watched the national geographic channel for weeks to understand and imbibe animal traits is the most complex role of my career and thank god for my co stars all of us danny saab mithunda and of course imran are one big boys club we work and party together and women are not allowed in fact ive adopted danny saab as my guru theres no rivalry no one upmanship all of us have well defined rugged and sporty parts
612525 weve to do anything and everything from climbing mountains to plunging deep underwater to jumping off helicopters everyone had to get into special shape me included ive been working out doubly hard before coming to cape town
612526 all of us have been given clearly defined parts and ive never worked in a more friendly atmosphere in my life
612527 even imran who flew into south africa after becoming an overnight superstar is a pleasure to work with he is so down to earth he told me he had seen me in 1971 and liked me as for shruti shes the daughter of the living legend kamal haasan and already a rock star but she has no attitude shes one of us boys
612528 nakshatra was discontinued by aishwarya it is false news that she lost out the endorsement to katrina kaif aishwarya had some conditions and the company did not come to terms with this so she called it off
612529 endorsements are not a competition nobody loses an endorsement it is just that sometimes the technicalities dont work out between the endorser and the brand at the end of the day an endorser is asked to endorse a product because ones image looks best suited to the brand
612530 the experience is wonderful the tour is meant to reach people who dont get to see enough of bollywood action live it is wonderful to perform on stage
612531 we are through with one quarter of the show with performances in toronto trinidad and tobago los angeles and san francisco
612532 i learn everything that my wife teaches me once married you have to
612533 i think when you want to make out time you always can and in this case it was for a worthy cause
612534 blogs are a wonderful way of reaching out to audiences i would like to blog but i dont really have the time
612535 every director in mumbai wants to work with mr bachchan at least once i also want to work with him but i dont have a script for him right now
612536 i feel the script is the backbone of the film if not a bound script one should have a very strong idea about the treatment of the film you have to keep working on it my script for john ash is ready but i will do two more drafts before it actually goes on the floor
612537 there are others but it depends on the subject i dont look at the actors first and then go for a script if a story suits shah rukh khan i would love to go and meet him and work with him otherwise i am okay with different casts i try for the best cast once the story is ready
612538 i have made two thrillers that doesnt mean i dont like other genres i want to do other genres this film has got shocks and surprises but it is not a thriller it is more of a personal story it doesnt have blood or guns
612539 it is not a romantic thriller and it is not a romantic comedy either it is a different kind of film i cant give you the plotline right now because it is too early the film will be released after a year or so i cant talk about it
612540 like my last two films this one is also set in mumbai and ramesh sippy is producing it as for the budget i dont know
612541 the confusion was because they had liked the basic storyline but i hadnt got the script ready even then they agreed to do the film i had dates of beginning of this year february march but couldnt use them because i hadnt finished the script by then
612542 so i pushed the project back now i have to wait for them to be free i dont know when i will start shooting the film
612543 im not casting aishwarya or john because they are big names i am casting them because they are right for the film i wont cast anyone if i dont have the confidence in that person
612544 i have taken aishwarya because she is a good actor and john has a very likeable presence and i feel that his potential has not been fully exploited
612545 i worked with my dad in my first film himalay putra it was a terrifying experience therere certain people whom you shouldnt work with my dad is one of them
612546 mr amitabh bachchan is another to stand in the same frame as them confidently is impossible theyve such an overpowering screen presence
612547 its very difficult to match my father on screen its that quality either you have it or you dont have it very frankly i dont have it i just dont have that kind of presence therere some actors who just wash you away on screen my dad is one of them
612548 but yes govinda is another actor i feel the same way about hes a very effective actor govinda is a very scary actor even sanjay dutt has such an overpowering screen presence
612549 mere baap is a genuine feel good film i like doing such films my character puts his fathers happiness ahead of his own the son is more like a father and vice versa pareshs character is so childlike its a very heart warming kind of relationship paresh and i have always gotten along we spend a lot of time together when were working
612550 i do the films i get and id rather be in a successful film than a good film having said that i must say gandhi my father is the single most important film of my career probably my best work im immensely attached to it
612551 agreed my next release short cut after mere baap pehle aap is also an out and out comedy
612552 it was a personal affair i would not like to say anything about it
612553 both of them played the perfect hosts and looked like a couple
612554 i dont want to discuss personal life it is completely my personal affair and i would not like to comment on it
612555 im so amused by all these articles im not admitting or denying anything but most of what is being written is completely untrue if it were a controversy regarding my career id react i wouldnt want to comment on my personal life
612556 neither will i comment on bhais saif ali khans relationship with kareena kapoor about which im often asked to be a spokesperson because hes inaccessible its so boring to comment on their relationship its got nothing to with my life
612557 when i get married id owe it to the public to tell them about it but theres no private life if i talk about it publicly
612558 those reports were entirely made up i think such stories are written in the hope that id finally be provoked into reacting such reports of a relationship and a break up are so flagrant they just annoy me
612559 i went with siddharth and a group of friends to a musical event organised by composer sandeep chowta to cheer three of the greatest musical legends rather than cover the legends the press found it more interesting to photograph me and siddharth
612560 this are they together are they not can go on for ever my life isnt an open book but im not going to stop living my life the way i want to just because im a private person ill go exactly where i want to and when i want and with whom i want to
612561 at the moment i feel completely isolated in mumbai my parents and my sister are there in london as it is they are potential anglophiles they inevitably spend a part of the year in london since bhai is there for a while they all decided to join him
612562 i cant be with them because im shooting dhoondte reh jaoge with kunal khemu and paresh rawal in mumbai ive been travelling but right now ive no choice but to enjoy the monsoon i was hoping to join them but i cant ill go on my own later
612563 the last time we were all together was when my parents were in mumbai we all got together for dinner it was unforgettable
612564 but he has been coming to mumbai recently because of cricket hes attached to the bcci board of control for cricket in india my mother keeps coming for her film censorship work
612565 as for saif hes become very family oriented lately he increasingly understands the importance of the family because of his attachment to his own children hes even started doing family films like thoda pyaar thoda magic
612566 im afraid a lot of inaccuracies and fabrications have crept into the reports in india about my sonia project yes i did meet her but she has not given the nod to the project nor has she said no
612567 she was gracious but noncommittal and extremely genteel she wanted to know if biopics were made about living people i pointed out several films on nelson mandela i told her i didnt want to make a film about sonia the politician but about two individuals from disparate backgrounds who fall in love and make a life together
612568 i told her things she thought no one knew when she came from italy to england she went to a school of languages in cambridge to learn english i also told her about the bakery in london where rajiv used to clean the chimney in the night about that bird in a nest in his room in london for which he wouldnt close the window in the night so the bird could return home and soniajis fondness for the ice creams that rajivji took her to have at india gate
612569 but i repeat she has neither said yes nor no
612570 ive been asked to hold on till the general elections in 2009
612571 im young im new to the national scene obama said
612572 the one thing we know about the team that john mccain has assembled because its a carry over from some of the folks who have worked on the bush campaigns obama said at a press conference at cape canaveral fla
612573 they are very good at negative campaigns they are not so good at governing
612574 we get four or five shots in a row assertions by mccain that i would rather lose a war so that i can win a campaign that i am not willing to visit the troops that i somehow am full of myself that im an empty headed celebrity whatever repeated attacks have been launched this week so when i say boy those are kind of silly arguments the press says isnt that being negative
612575 ultimately what i think weve got to do is keep driving home the essential message of this campaign that weve got to change business as usual
612576 let me be clear in no way do i think john mccains campaign was being racist obama said
612577 i think theyre cynical to which mccain campaign spokesman tucker bounds today replied
612578 obama is against offshore drilling and wants us to have high gas prices

612584 it will take those anemones off cos they are a pain in the ass and it will eat some cos they are good to eat

612587 the ineptitude at the end of the england innings was quite staggering
612588 that was brainless simply brainless i dont care what you say about thats the way he plays it was selfish and brainless it was almost as brainless as this bloke running around the middle naked
612589 until flintoffs late intervention diligence with the bat was the watchword for the south africans as they began the process of squeezing england out of the series yesterday
612590 these south africans rarely give willingly they would not pee in your ear if your brain was on fire it must be something in their upbringing
612591 through the whole tour i had not had one puncture but on the champs elysees i managed to get two punctures in the last lap and a half
612592 after the first puncture i still thought i could get back and win but then i punctured a second time i put in a big effort and managed to get to the right place coming out of the tunnel with one and a half kilometres to go
612593 i had already wasted some much needed energy but i still felt good the problem was i was a bit too far back and the speed was really high so to make the effort to go forward would have really wasted my chances for the sprint so i gambled and waited for someone else to make the move forward but no one did
612594 its probably better for the climbers so we may end up working for john lee

612608 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
612609 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
612610 i dont know too much about them but we should be better than them
612611 i think odense are a better team than these are but i am expecting them to be physical as most sides in iceland are we should be happy with the draw and it shouldnt be a problem
612612 they are a very strong team better than odense they are near the top of the norwegian league at this stage it is always good to avoid the strongest team we could meet
612613 ive never heard of them but obviously they must be a decent team to be where they are
612614 they are in the same position as us to qualify for the uefa cup we will go into it focused and we wont take it lightly
612615 the truth is that the only person i am angry with is myself i have no one else to blame but most of all i really regret hurting people not the sort of words youd expect from a dominatrix
612616 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
612617 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
612618 it was a personal affair i would not like to say anything about it
612619 both of them played the perfect hosts and looked like a couple
612620 i dont want to discuss personal life it is completely my personal affair and i would not like to comment on it
612621 nakshatra was discontinued by aishwarya it is false news that she lost out the endorsement to katrina kaif aishwarya had some conditions and the company did not come to terms with this so she called it off
612622 endorsements are not a competition nobody loses an endorsement it is just that sometimes the technicalities dont work out between the endorser and the brand at the end of the day an endorser is asked to endorse a product because ones image looks best suited to the brand
612623 the experience is wonderful the tour is meant to reach people who dont get to see enough of bollywood action live it is wonderful to perform on stage
612624 we are through with one quarter of the show with performances in toronto trinidad and tobago los angeles and san francisco
612625 i learn everything that my wife teaches me once married you have to
612626 i think when you want to make out time you always can and in this case it was for a worthy cause
612627 blogs are a wonderful way of reaching out to audiences i would like to blog but i dont really have the time
612628 i worked with my dad in my first film himalay putra it was a terrifying experience therere certain people whom you shouldnt work with my dad is one of them
612629 mr amitabh bachchan is another to stand in the same frame as them confidently is impossible theyve such an overpowering screen presence
612630 its very difficult to match my father on screen its that quality either you have it or you dont have it very frankly i dont have it i just dont have that kind of presence therere some actors who just wash you away on screen my dad is one of them
612631 but yes govinda is another actor i feel the same way about hes a very effective actor govinda is a very scary actor even sanjay dutt has such an overpowering screen presence
612632 mere baap is a genuine feel good film i like doing such films my character puts his fathers happiness ahead of his own the son is more like a father and vice versa pareshs character is so childlike its a very heart warming kind of relationship paresh and i have always gotten along we spend a lot of time together when were working
612633 i do the films i get and id rather be in a successful film than a good film having said that i must say gandhi my father is the single most important film of my career probably my best work im immensely attached to it
612634 agreed my next release short cut after mere baap pehle aap is also an out and out comedy
612635 im afraid a lot of inaccuracies and fabrications have crept into the reports in india about my sonia project yes i did meet her but she has not given the nod to the project nor has she said no
612636 she was gracious but noncommittal and extremely genteel she wanted to know if biopics were made about living people i pointed out several films on nelson mandela i told her i didnt want to make a film about sonia the politician but about two individuals from disparate backgrounds who fall in love and make a life together
612637 i told her things she thought no one knew when she came from italy to england she went to a school of languages in cambridge to learn english i also told her about the bakery in london where rajiv used to clean the chimney in the night about that bird in a nest in his room in london for which he wouldnt close the window in the night so the bird could return home and soniajis fondness for the ice creams that rajivji took her to have at india gate
612638 but i repeat she has neither said yes nor no
612639 ive been asked to hold on till the general elections in 2009
612640 shilpa and i were to co host bigg boss and after being inmates at bigg boss and celebrity big brother wed have made a nice pair but unfortunately this film where i play a psycho required immense preparation
612641 my character is like many animals rolled into one sometimes he is a hyena sometimes he becomes a rabbit i watched the national geographic channel for weeks to understand and imbibe animal traits is the most complex role of my career and thank god for my co stars all of us danny saab mithunda and of course imran are one big boys club we work and party together and women are not allowed in fact ive adopted danny saab as my guru theres no rivalry no one upmanship all of us have well defined rugged and sporty parts
612642 weve to do anything and everything from climbing mountains to plunging deep underwater to jumping off helicopters everyone had to get into special shape me included ive been working out doubly hard before coming to cape town
612643 all of us have been given clearly defined parts and ive never worked in a more friendly atmosphere in my life
612644 even imran who flew into south africa after becoming an overnight superstar is a pleasure to work with he is so down to earth he told me he had seen me in 1971 and liked me as for shruti shes the daughter of the living legend kamal haasan and already a rock star but she has no attitude shes one of us boys
612645 mr le pr sident ressentez vous la douleur des coeurs d chir s jamais

612647 mr le pr sident ressentez vous la douleur des coeurs d chir s jamais
612648 mr le pr sident ressentez vous la douleur des coeurs d chir s jamais
612649 im so amused by all these articles im not admitting or denying anything but most of what is being written is completely untrue if it were a controversy regarding my career id react i wouldnt want to comment on my personal life
612650 neither will i comment on bhais saif ali khans relationship with kareena kapoor about which im often asked to be a spokesperson because hes inaccessible its so boring to comment on their relationship its got nothing to with my life
612651 when i get married id owe it to the public to tell them about it but theres no private life if i talk about it publicly
612652 those reports were entirely made up i think such stories are written in the hope that id finally be provoked into reacting such reports of a relationship and a break up are so flagrant they just annoy me
612653 i went with siddharth and a group of friends to a musical event organised by composer sandeep chowta to cheer three of the greatest musical legends rather than cover the legends the press found it more interesting to photograph me and siddharth
612654 this are they together are they not can go on for ever my life isnt an open book but im not going to stop living my life the way i want to just because im a private person ill go exactly where i want to and when i want and with whom i want to
612655 at the moment i feel completely isolated in mumbai my parents and my sister are there in london as it is they are potential anglophiles they inevitably spend a part of the year in london since bhai is there for a while they all decided to join him
612656 i cant be with them because im shooting dhoondte reh jaoge with kunal khemu and paresh rawal in mumbai ive been travelling but right now ive no choice but to enjoy the monsoon i was hoping to join them but i cant ill go on my own later
612657 the last time we were all together was when my parents were in mumbai we all got together for dinner it was unforgettable
612658 but he has been coming to mumbai recently because of cricket hes attached to the bcci board of control for cricket in india my mother keeps coming for her film censorship work
612659 as for saif hes become very family oriented lately he increasingly understands the importance of the family because of his attachment to his own children hes even started doing family films like thoda pyaar thoda magic
612660 every director in mumbai wants to work with mr bachchan at least once i also want to work with him but i dont have a script for him right now
612661 i feel the script is the backbone of the film if not a bound script one should have a very strong idea about the treatment of the film you have to keep working on it my script for john ash is ready but i will do two more drafts before it actually goes on the floor
612662 there are others but it depends on the subject i dont look at the actors first and then go for a script if a story suits shah rukh khan i would love to go and meet him and work with him otherwise i am okay with different casts i try for the best cast once the story is ready
612663 i have made two thrillers that doesnt mean i dont like other genres i want to do other genres this film has got shocks and surprises but it is not a thriller it is more of a personal story it doesnt have blood or guns
612664 it is not a romantic thriller and it is not a romantic comedy either it is a different kind of film i cant give you the plotline right now because it is too early the film will be released after a year or so i cant talk about it
612665 like my last two films this one is also set in mumbai and ramesh sippy is producing it as for the budget i dont know
612666 the confusion was because they had liked the basic storyline but i hadnt got the script ready even then they agreed to do the film i had dates of beginning of this year february march but couldnt use them because i hadnt finished the script by then
612667 so i pushed the project back now i have to wait for them to be free i dont know when i will start shooting the film
612668 im not casting aishwarya or john because they are big names i am casting them because they are right for the film i wont cast anyone if i dont have the confidence in that person
612669 i have taken aishwarya because she is a good actor and john has a very likeable presence and i feel that his potential has not been fully exploited

612711 the evangelical lutheran church bishops have embraced trendiness and abandoned the very scriptures that are their basis for evangelizing if these bishops choose to violate gods instruction book church members have two choices should they wish to continue to honor the authority of scripture and its author they can remove the bishops from office or they can leave the denomination to remain in the denomination and do nothing makes members co conspirators in the bishops apostasy

612715 it is good that the investment projects are being carried out by different companies from different countries
612716 if they would like to build a business centre why should there be delays we get good complexes it is beneficial to both sides but one should not drag out the making of decisions they should be taken swiftly
612717 belarus has never had such a harvest in its history and we should gather it in today we have the purest grain weve been investing heavily in agriculture and here is the payback
612718 we mustnt fail to gather in the harvest due to poor management and lack of organisation
612719 all the same it will be profitable getting not only bread but meat and milk is the key thing at present
612720 we can sell our meat and milk to the rich countries we buy gas and oil from
612721 i want the country to finally get profits from agriculture so that nobody could reproach us for wasting money
612722 every tonne of grain today is more precious than gold if we lose the grain we will be poor
612723 as a result we are getting the harvest equal to the one in 2004 a five year record high
612724 we are happy that the un has sent an experienced skilled professional to belarus
612725 under her leadership the un office in belarus acted as a reliable partner of the belarusian government in promoting economic reforms strengthening international technical aid for most important programmes including the international technical cooperation programme 2006 2010
612726 belarus is not going to raise this issue in the near term perspective but the issue will remain on the agenda
612727 we follow the situation consider the possibilities of participating in various elected bodies of the organisation
612728 such countries have their own specific problems which could not be solved without international help

612730 we have approached the point when further gdp growth is impossible if we do not put in operation additional capacities manufacture new products
612731 capital investment is not the end in itself it is the means to maintain high gdp growth at 10 12 annually in 2009 2010 we project the same rate of economic growth
612732 when the agreement was signed on december 31 2006 we relied on the russian estimate that oil prices would decline as there are articles in both russian and belarusian civil codes under which an agreement may be amended or severed given significant changes in circumstances we suggest either sitting down at the negotiating table and either severing the agreement which is unacceptable or supplementing it to reach a civilized solution on the gas price for belarus
612733 while at the beginning of 2008 the price of gas for belarus was 119 for 1 000 cubic meters now we have switched to 127 9 which will remain until the end of the year
612734 if the strategy declared earlier is followed russia will have to double fuel prices as of january 1 2011 which will be disastrous for it
612735 russia will slow down the motion and we can come up with the argument why can a price be significantly raised for our small country
612736 gazprom paid belarus 105 million in the first half for the transit when gazprom made the transit payment we used the money to cover the difference between 119 for 1 000 cubic meters of gas for belarus in the first quarter and 128 in the second

612739 we have a large group of rich people who are moving to this poor environment
612740 the people around them are still very poor they are very angry
612741 there is a group of people who are sore at us we didnt buy their houses for 3 million or 5 million
612742 they have this feeling that if they keep complaining all the time then ill have to buy them out to get rid of this headache
612743 were just thinking about playing russia right now and about keeping getting better
612744 i think if you look ahead you can get knocked off by anybody i think we played really well tonight because we had so much respect for lithuania who i think will also be a medal round team or a medal winner
612745 im healthy as ive been in two years im excited not only about this opportunity but also about the rest of my career
612746 you feel like an ape in the zoo the poles come with their binoculars stare and swear at us
612747 its a nudist beach its terrible that poles come over dressed and stare
612748 its horrible we would never bathe naked we are catholic
612749 i think she is in good shape because in the season she won every race
612750 normally we train in germany before we came here we went to minsk of belarus for three days and then we started to come to beijing
612751 maybe four or five times we go to belarussia one year in the preparation for the olympics we stayed there for two weeks and trained in belarussia
612752 and maybe girls from china romania and new zeland are also strong
612753 we got back to within six points in the last quarter
612754 but we had to foul and just couldnt get over the line
612755 it was more a size thing they were just too big for us
612756 every time they needed a basket they just went inside whereas we would have to try and force a turnover or beat them in transition
612757 charmian was probably our best player grabbing five or six offensive rebounds
612758 the attacks were meant to bring us to our knees and they did but not in the way the terrorists intended
612759 seven bahai individuals have set up an illegal organization with connections to a number of countries including israel and they have received orders from them to undertake measures against the islamic system
612760 this fact led to the arrest of seven individuals they have all confessed to the formation of an illegal organization including having ties with israel
612761 the weather was in our favour last night but the wind flared up again this morning despite this we will have the fire totally under control today
612762 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
612763 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
612764 they have to settle all their differences otherwise it will lead to a crisis in all iraqi cities
612765 it was a democratic process why did they reject it
612766 we arabs are against any new resolution that could affect our presence in this city
612767 the event in tibet this spring as well as protests regarding the torch relay was a worldwide negative campaign for the olympics in beijing
612768 on a global scale i dont think you are going to get this kind of investment again

612775 ive missed out on so much i should have been getting on with my life who knows what i could have done and achieved
612776 i dont want to spend any more time in any of her majestys holiday camps i wont follow women anymore i know its wrong
612777 to be quite honest and practical i dont think theyll ever find who done it
612778 i cant begin to understand or feel what they must be going through
612779 we have to guard against infodemics in which inaccurate false information is disseminated prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic
612780 her first words were that she was very happy to see very nice people she was very pleased about that she was ecstatic
612781 we wanted to make sure rockefeller was outside the apartment to apprehend him outside away from his child was the best case scenario
612782 granting an evil calculated killer any kind of dispensation is criminal and leaves the judiciary with blood on its hands
612783 it was an ugly scene with blood everywhere i could not count the dead i just glanced at once and i ran away for my life
612784 on a global scale i dont think you are going to get this kind of investment again
612785 we see this as a marketing platform that will help us to achieve market leadership in china this year

612798 is it ok not to be fully open to whom we are to get ahead look at politics or economic power
612799 is it ok for us to choose to make more money
612800 i go out of my way to prove stereotypes are not how i act usually
612801 why should i have to feel what i do represents my race
612802 it took a long time for me learning what it means to be white and about white privilege i grew up thinking you should be colorblind
612803 because asians have a hard work ethic they need to work to experience grace
612804 they try to earn gods favor just like they earn a parents approval
612805 a lot of what we are taught in general society is that its very individual that its all you
612806 our parents have been dreaming about us since we were in the womb
612807 dreams full of blessings and happiness yet sometimes the dream is so specific it feels like a script handed down ready for us already written and ready for us to step into the role
612808 shes a really traditional woman in china she didnt know of any christians there i guess she wants me to focus on my studies
612809 we tried to understand how we as asian americans contribute to the spiritual backdrop of america

612816 survey work confirms our earlier estimate that over 1 000 000 iraqi citizens have died as a result of the conflict which started in 2003 we now estimate that the death toll between march 2003 and august 2007 is likely to have been of the order of 1 033 000 if one takes into account the margin of error associated with survey data of this nature then the estimated range is between 946 000 and 1 120 000

612829 across the casentino there runs a stream called archiano born in the apennines above the hermitage there at the place where that streams name is lost i came my throat was pierced fleeing on foot and bloodying the plain and there it was that i lost sight and speech and there as i had finished uttering the name of mary i fell and there my flesh alone remained you are aware how in the air moist vapor will gather and again revert to rain as soon as it has climbed where cold enfolds his evil will which only seeks out evil conjoined with intellect and with the power his nature grants he stirred up wind and vapor and then when day was done he filled the valley from pratomagno far as the great ridge with mist the sky above was saturated the dense air was converted into water rain fell and then the gullies had to carry whatever water earth could not receive and when that rain was gathered into torrents it rushed so swiftly toward the royal river that nothing could contain its turbulence the angry archiano at its mouth had found my frozen body and it thrust it in the arno and set loose the cross that on my chest my arms in pain had formed it rolled me on the banks and river bed then covered girded me with its debris

612836 you have to press a button on the handle while simultaneously putting a foot on one of the foot pads that sit above the motor and wheels wait a couple of seconds and a light on the handle turns green its the signal to put your other foot up and stand upright on the machine the only action that required a little more balancing skills was getting off it then it is necessary to press the button on the handle and step down once the light turns red which signals that the winglet is turned off once youve surpassed the learning curve its literally all fun and games from there

612849 when that was going through his mind as you guys noticed he was not working as hard as he had been

612880 commenting on blogs is an excellent free traffic generating method time consuming though many bloggers have joined in on the dofollow wagon and you can now get a full credited backlink when commenting on a blog that has it if by chance they do not have the dofollow turned on then you will most times find a top commentators section that if you comment enough your link will appear on the side bar for a full linkback sometimes blogs have both like this one so you are in a sense getting rewarded twice for commenting

612882 there are only three guys on this team that should be playing e ball they are all ee players and jv players at waterloo we said at the beginning of the summer that we wanted to have some fun play some good baseball and improve for next years high school team i think we did that and here we were in the state final four

612886 his strength is the way he designs sound he has revolutionized film music he is perpetually on a quest to get the best out of you and makes you feel at ease which is important i have sung some of my best songs for him
612887 rahman never ceases to amaze me he is a fine musician as well as a techno junkie give him a set of headphones and hell rip it apart to understand why it works so well
612888 except the state does not require pit bull owners to implant a microchip to track the dogs as was the case in the citys proposal
612889 we dont need to duplicate a state law that would be very costly to us as a city to enforce
612890 a lot of responsibility lies with the owners of these dogs about how theyre trained and taken care of
612891 and only four of those were from pit bulls currently the city has seven registered pit bulls and three pit bull mixes but he believes there are more that are unregistered
612892 mostly pit bulls are good dogs but we dont know what kind of owners they have

612895 you become most like the five people you spend most of your time with
612896 last year lawmakers put the kibosh on smoking stripping and so called skill based gaming in bars and storefronts across ohio
612897 im making a distinction that i think is a legitimate distinction between casino gambling or other kinds of gambling in ohio and the lottery which is an activity that has been voted on by the people has been supported by the people of this state for a long time and this is an activity that is state controlled and state regulated and i think there is a vast difference between what we have proposed and what has been proposed by some entities in the recent past
612898 i am starting to think that we may have to take down the whole lottery to make this thing work
612899 youd have to do it over time because it has become something of a revenue dependency in an important sector
612900 achieve its budget target by enhancing lottery revenues through refreshing game products and adding games such as keno and other monitor games limited to age and time controlled settings such as bars and other similar venues
612901 we dont expect people to be playing until around the first drawing
612902 no rule shall authorize a lottery game that has more than two announcements of prize winners per day or is played on a slot machine as defined by ohio revised code including but not limited to a game of keno
612903 its very low level bottom feeding kind of economic activity it sucks part of the lifeblood out of our own work force here and we cant afford it
612904 it can be stopped legislatively but its not the only way it can be stopped
612905 we just couldnt put things together a few calls that could have gone our way didnt but we try to be good sports about it and take defeat in stride
612906 i thought wed come in and do what weve been doing all season long
612907 they capitalized on the errors you cant have those kind of errors at this level this is a hard one to swallow
612908 our goal was to get to state and win it
612909 we have the team to do it but just didnt to get to the final four is still pretty big
612910 thursday i took a day off work and brought them out here
612911 just to get them over the shock and awe of the field we brought them out here at 10 30 in the morning
612912 when the bottom of the order can carry the top of the order thats where its at
612913 when you can have a one two punch on the mound the way we do thats the key to it
612914 we absolutely believe the hotel is not only an important component to what were looking to create but that there is a huge void in the market for a hospitality facility that caters to kent state university the local business community and the general traveler
612915 early indications appear positive however until the study is completed which we anticipate will happen by early august it would be too early to comment
612916 the hard part is to say what becomes a possibility with this type of facility
612917 all those things open up if you have that type of facility here in the city of kent
612918 ksu being the third largest university in ohio its unusual that we dont have a hotel conference facility
612919 i think the university will be a main driver but then youll also have too the general kinds of leisure and heritage tourism i think would be big if we could secure a hotel

612923 allochtone jongens zijn over het algemeen niet zulke goede schaatsers maar ze zijn wel erg eergevoelig ik vermoed dat ze hier verstek laten gaan omdat ze bang zijn dat ze letterlijk en figuurlijk onderuit gaan
612924 zestien leerlingen kozen ervoor om spelletjes te doen op school dat wilden ze liever dan schaatsen onder die zestien zitten minstens tien allochtone jongens
612925 jongens die hier schaatsen zijn uitgerekend die jongens die minder met opvallen en met hun uiterlijk bezig zijn jongens op school die zich daar wel mee bezig houden die wilden juist niet mee naar de ijsbaan
612926 people dont simply wake up one day and commit genocide they start by setting themselves apart from others diminishing the stature of those adhering to dissenting beliefs in small insidious steps they begin by saying were the righteous and well tolerate those others and as the toleration diminishes over time the inevitable harms are overlooked it is for that reason that james madison wisely wrote that it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties

612937 the economic sanctions on iraq now result in serious shortages of food clean water and medicine water and sanitation systems have collapsed fueling an epidemic of diseases denis j halliday the former un head of the oil for food program estimates that over 5 000 iraqi children under five are dying each month from malnutrition and disease directly related to the sanctions meanwhile the iraqi government remains untouched and firmly entrenched

613008 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of shaheed martyr benazir bhutto
613009 while existing on the absolute fringes of our tolerant and peace loving societies terrorists in our region receive institutional nurturing and support it is this embedded nature of terrorists that make it a much more sinister threat
613010 force is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one
613011 saya tidak pernah menulis email seperti itu saya yakin email ini bertujuan untuk menumbuhkan dan menciptakan saling kecurigaan diantara terman teman sehingga menghancurkan gerakan yang sudah dibangun bersama semua isi dari email tersebut bohong dan fitnah
613012 there are reasons to believe this coming crisis is different and bigger than the world has ever experienced instead of using globalism in a positive fashion its been used to globalize all of the mistakes of the politicians bureaucrats and central bankers
613013 we have reached a point in financial history that we have never seen before thats right no one you are reading and no one commenting on our current financial markets is an expert on where we are going so successful navigation of these straits will require a great deal of listening frankness and humility things that have always been in short supply within the financial system
613014 love is a knife thrust into the heart of a child
613015 nothing tastes as sweet as something that weve fought for no victory complete unless our foe is strong and ruthless nothing satisfies like that which was so long denied and there the answer lies to feel the joy we must relive the pain
613016 in the mind a shining lie is stronger than the deepest truth
613017 ive yet to get the answer think i should forget about any thought that is coming and just concentrate on things that i wanna share and make sure the audiences get what i meant

613024 seniors not taking proper care of themselves or not taking their medications
613025 if we open a case a worker will go out and meet with the senior talk about different services that are available encourage them to apply for passport services through the area agency on aging
613026 its usually family members or people they know if we have an investigation like that we get police involved from the get go
613027 the sad part of that is sometimes the senior knows whats going on but doesnt want to do anything because they believe its better to live with that person than alone
613028 from the 30th of june we have no longer been able to ship a pc with an xp licence
613029 however what we have been able to do with microsoft is ship pcs with a vista business licence but with xp pre loaded that is still the majority of business computers we are selling today
613030 looking into the crystal ball i dont think businesses will see much value in upgrading to vista until late next year and even so microsoft will probably have come out with something else by then
613031 so many opportunities ive wasted when what i wanted the most was to prove to the whole world that i did not need to prove anything to anyone
613032 this is me omg this is me too whoa so me
613033 whatever system an intj happens to be working on is for them the equivalent of a moral cause to an infj both perfectionism and disregard for authority may come into play as intjs can be unsparing of both themselves and the others on the project
613034 intjs can rise to management positions when they are willing to invest time in marketing their abilities as well as enhancing them and whether for the sake of ambition or the desire for privacy many also find it useful to learn to simulate some degree of surface conformism in order to mask their inherent unconventionality

613076 did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of your path but not on the other pots side thats because i have always known about your flaw and i took advantage of it i planted flower seeds on your side of the path and every day while we walk back from the stream youve watered them for two years i have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my masters table without you being just the way you are he would not have this beauty to grace his house

613082 you have to scrap that because youve got to have time
613083 and that is exactly what politics is all about the judgment you bring to make decisions
613084 and the truth is that weve got a bunch of smart people i think who know ten times more than we do about the specifics of the topics and so if what youre trying to do is micromanage and solve everything then you end up being a dilettante but you have to have enough knowledge to make good judgments about the choices that are presented to you

613100 when gary first asked me to be a presenter my first concern was i was going to have a difficult time explaining how good he really was
613101 offensive linemen get very little attention gary wanted very little of it there was no doubt in my mind he was the mainstay of our offensive line and a major reason why we were able to go and win our first super bowl in 1997
613102 there should be a stage full of guys standing up here receiving this honor with me

613117 de atatea ori am cerut ministerului mediului sa ia masurile care se impun de fiecare data ni s a spus ca ursii sunt animale prote jate iata ca s a intamplat o nenorocire pe care am anti ci pat o am avertizat toate institutiile responsabile ca se va intampla odata aceasta nenorocire
613118 i au preluat si i am transferat institutului de cercetari si amenajari silvice care avea rolul de a i duce in muntii harghita din pacate s a adeverit ce am spus eu si anume ca acesti ursi se vor intoarce avem angajati care au capturat orice urs care a trecut pe domeniul public brasov in municipiul brasov avem un surplus de ursi de 25 de bucati am cerut ministerului mediului sa mareasca cota de vanat si sa ia masurile care se impun eu ca primar am o restrictie din acest punct de vedere
613119 conform prevederilor legale municipalitatea are obligatia de a proteja cetatenii impotriva pericolelor provocate de animale dar in aceasta situatie suntem in imposibilitatea de a aplica aceste prevederi legale deoarece o parte din institutiile publice interpreteaza legile de protejare a animalelor ca fiind pri o ritare in fata legilor de pro tejare a oamenilor
613120 la nivel national in anul 2007 2008 ministerul a eliberat 330 de derogari pentru impuscarea de ursi la brasov au fost emise 45 de derogari fiind impuscati 43 de ursi
613121 s a decis ca ursii gunoieri sa fie relocati in zone indepartate pentru a nu se mai intoarce in oras dar fara sa produca evenimente acolo unde sunt dusi actiunea este in curs fiind relocati 10 ursi

613137 with all the injuries we have got in that key area hooker we think thats the best option we have got
613138 we were pretty spot on and probably the best thing was that it was because we were under a lot of pressure and there was group of young people involved for those guys to experience that and come through on the other side i think is really good for them

613146 we do the late 15th century early 16th century form they would have had time by then to improve their health and safety

613148 it is an impact sport you can come off people do
613149 you dont believe it until it happens but your armour does protect you a certain amount
613150 it might hurt in some places but on the whole it does tend to protect you i didnt believe until it happened to me my armour is stainless steel and is quite thick
613151 it splinters and give you a better visual impact i understand they had just started to use hollow or jointed lances
613152 the horse is paramount its what we care about the most its absolutely vital that nothing happens to them
613153 it would have been import at the time a really good joust horse would be like ferrari to them

613160 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
613161 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
613162 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to

613216 i was surprised to read a report in a newspaper quoting me and saying that i was interested in the post of deputy chief minister not a single reporter spoke to me nor did i call up anybody to speak of state politics
613217 if we could do that nsg process expeditiously we can deliver the package to the us congress in september we have a lot to to in short term we hope we can bring it to fruition
613218 well by the time we get to the nuclear suppliers group we hope no country will object it is simply a process we have been working on with countries who had questions and are getting those questions answered
613219 we have been working with the nsg we have that line going india has to do some of that answer a lot of questions about its nuclear programme and safeguards and separation plan and all those things
613220 now that the indian government has worked its way through its political issues we are going to go forward full steam with that
613221 not to be absolutely certain is i think one of the essential things in rationality
613222 the difference between 74 73 75 theres not that much difference once you reach that level you might as well go to 75
613223 but i think that puts their increases away at least for a couple of years
613224 im really concerned about the potential threat to the environment from the importation of the savannah cat and we will be looking very closely at this thats why i have asked my department to undertake the proper assessment process as quickly as possible
613225 savannah cats are a cross between a serval which is an african wildcat and a domestic cat and they can grow much larger than normal domestic cats
613226 this report looks at the risk of savannah cats becoming feral if not properly contained and notes that there is potential for these cats to easily adapt to the australian environment
613227 this report suggests that the potential breeding in of wildcat genes to existing feral cat populations could see them develop even better hunting skills i will not hesitate to use the powers available to me under the epbc act to prohibit the import of savannah cats if it is necessary to protect the environment
613228 i encourage interested parties to provide comment on the report so i can ensure i take all relevant information into account
613229 heterosis is a term used in genetics and selective breeding

614037 masonry stoves are not terribly well known in this country
614038 but i think as the number of these units gradually increases more people will grow fond of masonry stoves once they get used to their many positive features with all the scares about fuel price swings and shortages having a masonry stove in your home is very reassuring

614090 christian used to lie beside me while i did the accounts at weekends
614091 and every so often if id ignored him for too long hed sock me across the head with one of his great big paws
614092 he was very loving and affectionate he liked to stand and put his paws on your shoulders but he was
614093 i mean he was a lion does that sound silly
614094 a friend had been to the exotic animals department at harrods and announced rather grandly that she wanted a camel
614095 to which the manager very coolly replied one hump or two madam
614096 ace and i thought this was the most sophisticated repartee wed ever heard so we went along to check it out and there in a small cage was a gorgeous little lion cub we were shocked we looked at each other and said somethings got to be done about that
614097 he had a beautiful musky smell that was very distinct
614098 it took all four of us me my then girlfriend jennifer mary ace berg and an actress called unity jones to look after him
614099 he also ate a lot four meals two liquid two solid plus supplements every day which cost about 30 a week a lot of money back then
614100 oh yes sometimes hed see people staring at him through the back window of the car keep very still on purpose and then just when they were convinced he was a stuffed toy he would very slowly turn his head and freak them out
614101 after id had one or two glasses of wine and when he put his paws on my shoulders one of them slipped his claw caught my dress and he pulled the whole front of it off
614102 you must be prepared for this not to work elsa was born in africa and she knew its smells taking a british born lion whose parents were also raised in captivity is going to be a very different thing
614103 i think george adamson got quite a shock when he met us
614104 straight from the kings road in all our gear flares from granny takes a trip and with hair everywhere
614105 we looked rather different from everyone else in nairobi but then so did christian hed come from winter in england so had a very thick coat he was almost as hairy as we were
614106 were miles from anywhere if we stop here and he runs away we will never ever catch him
614107 so he went tip toeing along and went to the loo
614108 i got back in the car too shut the door and george adamson turned round and said to me that is quite remarkable
614109 boy took one look and he clobbered him christian didnt fight back he rolled over on his back that went on for day after day until boy was obviously satisfied that christian knew who was boss and they became totally inseparable
614110 there was a look on his face as if to say you absolute fool
614111 christian hasnt been here for nine months we have no reason to think hes dead there have been no reports of lions poached or killed but he may never come back
614112 hes here with his lionesses and his cubs hes outside the camp on his favourite rock hes waiting for you
614113 i knew his expressions and i could see he was interested we called him and he stood up and started to walk towards us very slowly
614114 then as if he had become convinced it was us he ran towards us threw himself on to us knocked us over knocked george over and hugged us like he used to with his paws on our shoulders
614115 everyone was crying we were crying george was crying even the lion was nearly crying
614116 the lionesses were far from pleased there was a lot of growling and spitting
614117 george said this isnt safe wed better go so we each put a hand on christians back and he walked with us back to camp
614118 we watched him go back to the two lionesses who were not at all happy with this man smelling of nicotine whisky and humans
614119 he just walloped the two of them with his paw then collapsed

614126 we were surprised by earnings in india the huge demand for human capital and people with experience in management financial services and the it information technology sector means that expats have been able to demand increasingly higher salaries
614127 as the world becomes increasingly globalised companies want their managers to get a diversity of experience across the world while employees want an opportunity to experience a lifestyle and culture different from their own

614130 it has a strong brand and is past most of the difficult times it has recently experienced the company is now ready to focus on growing its core
614131 it isnt all that often when you are presented a chance to lead a major american company
614132 the goal is to get into strategic discussions about where people think were currently at and where there are opportunities for the future
614133 im also digging into all the reports so i can get up to speed quickly
614134 but this is a prision father dont you know how to draw a bird
614135 dont you know father the difference between a wheatstalk and a gun
614136 son once i used to know the shapes of wheatstalks the shape of the loaf the shape of the rose but in this hardened time the trees of the forest have joined the militia men and the rose wears dull fatigues in this time of armed wheatstalks armed birds armed culture and armed religion you cant buy a loaf without finding a gun inside you cant pluck a rose in the field without its raising its thorns in your face you cant buy a book that doesnt explode between your fingers
614137 when you grow up my son and read the diwan of arabic poetry youll discover that the word and the tear are twins and the arabic poem is no more than a tear wept by writing fingers
614138 we the farmers of the four county area would like to let you know that we do appreciate all that you and your company has done in the past and hopefully the future we as farmers need competition in the cattle industry whether it is in the country selling our cattle or if it is in the sales barns without your buyers we can see a 3 to a 5 cent per pound difference for our cattle also without agri more than just the farmers feel the hurt it trickles down to everyone in the area so with this short note we hope you feel the support thank you
614139 they probably did do a few things bent a few rules
614140 i just stopped talking about it because it became a distraction
614141 hes put so many contingencies around it that i wonder in fact i question whether he would do it at all
614142 it may be a way for him to gain favor during the election and tube it later because all the contingencies werent met
614143 believes that finding consensus is essential to solving our energy crisis
614144 not one issue of national prominence where he led the country
614145 he wasnt rancorous and was definitely genuine a good cheerleader
614146 i like things to look nice and i really believe first impressions are lasting
614147 this is about people taking more pride in their property
614148 before we started doing this years ago no one maintained it
614149 in the past this has been much worse were hoping people are catching on
614150 im going to do whatever it takes to do what i want
614151 they told me he was going to die to put him in the nursing home because there was no hope
614152 hes been motivated and i think thats the reason that hes come so far
614153 how do you say thank you to somebody who gave you your life back before them i didnt have a life i was basically dead
614154 his dad said ill believe it when i see him coming in we didnt know if he would walk again he was in pretty bad shape
614155 the oldest was 14 the youngest was 3 days old we were all so sad and here was our mom wondering what she was going to do how she was going to raise all these kids by herself
614156 it was entirely possible our family would have been separated the kids sent off to live with other people
614157 i guess it doesnt sound like much money today for a family of 12
614158 but it was a godsend it allowed us to stay together and continue to be a family
614159 i remember my grandmother yelling to my grandfather that bob had passed away
614160 i remember everybody crying i remember my little brother jim and i crawling under a sheet and hiding it was awful but life certainly did go on
614161 not once i dont think its in her nature but i also think she really didnt have to
614162 other families in our situation had their children parceled out to relatives we stayed together and had a good life social security made that possible im sure a believer in it its a government program that works i hate to see it when some people start wanting to mess around with it i worry that some day other families wont have the opportunity we had
614163 eisenhowers wasnt either although it might have been appropriate because farmers became eligible during his administration
614164 i asked her what it was like for her and what she was thinking when dad died
614165 mom told me i said to myself that the next 10 years would be very difficult can you imagine that a lot of people would have given up not her
614166 public safety is gov culvers no 1 priority which is why he is committed to ensuring that iowans have as much notice before severe weather strikes
614167 since they are not required i dont know where you are going to get that list
614168 with limited budgets cities look at things like economic development roads police and fire protection as their priorities
614169 the siren program is still there but there is minimal money for it
614170 the truth is the sirens are not required for weather warnings although they are still part of the package
614171 we promote noaa weather alert radios and try to educate the public every home should have one
614172 the best thing about noaa weather alert radios is that it not only gives you an alert but tells you what the problem is and what protective measures you can take to protect yourself that is a lot more than a siren can do so noaa weather alert radios may be truly lifesaving
614173 its a safety thing and we are in a state that has a lot of tornadoes
614174 weve had anywhere from 50 to 150 people per day and weve been getting phone calls daily from people wanting to come in august right now were doing the last rake through of peoples yards we cant start rebuilding until all the debris is gone
614175 for the first three weeks i was here it was pretty shaky
614176 there wasnt a lot getting done but right now we have 40 more americorps people sent in from the governor and were getting crews from all over im really hoping to have all the homes cleaned out and gutted by the end of next week so we can start the rebuilding process in the next month or so
614177 we keep files of requests and they come in every day at any time we have 100 houses waiting that need help we can take as many volunteers as we can get one group said they could easily take another 100 volunteers
614178 we put out a local call for assistance in helping flood victims removing debris and we had farmers and people with skid loaders coming in to help
614179 i dont know if its midwest ethics but you just do what you need to do people dont always go ask for help they just step up to the plate and do it
614180 a lot of these people dont have the money themselves to rebuild
614181 it all depends on donations of money and labor if that happens a lot of these people will rebuild it seems a good third of people want to stay a third probably wont and a third want to see what happens with everyone else before they make their decision
614182 the people who live it every single day are exhausted
614183 when you have people who come in from minnesota or michigan they not only provide another hand to help but they give those people living here a break
614184 i think it was a crisis before the flood but i think its very obvious now what the needs are
614185 any housing that we lose there is going to affect the affordable housing arena
614186 its not just me its the reality of the whole situation
614187 were investigating this in the context of basic consumer rights
614188 you could see year after year the intensity of her trying to be the best that she could be trying to be a champion
614189 thats not the bottom line for me i want you to learn the value of an education to learn the value of being a good person and doing the right thing all the time
614190 what was that i dont like that lets do that again
614191 i tell them i talk softly so they can hear me
614192 the earth belongs to god and everything in it our purpose here is to always try to do our best to please him in everything we do at home in school at the track let us pray
614193 hes interested in developing the kids as a whole person not just super athletes
614194 i plant the seed and hope god will do the rest
614195 i had to fight just about every day until i learned to accent my speech a little bit better
614196 he spent a week with us training us how to use it he said he was going to leave it in our hands after that
614197 thats why i became more determined that no matter who you are or what you look like if you enjoy the sport well give you the opportunity
614198 when i say stuff like that a lot of people think maybe im not competitive in my heart im competitive but ive learned to be competitive based on what you have and what your abilities are
614199 hes just a nice gentleman thats the only way to describe him
614200 hes just a classy guy he loves kids and loves to see kids compete in track he makes kids better people
614201 its more than track because its building their confidence and encouraging them to do things they wouldnt normally do
614202 some of my greatest summer memories were from track practice on those hot iowa summers
614203 sets the stage to have athletes like lolo jones right here in iowa
614204 the thing i try to teach most is who to give the glory to
614205 the thing i try to teach behind the scenes is always be thankful that god has given us the ability to do what we can do he does that then you need to give him the glory
614206 it almost made me cry to be honest with you
614207 im so excited for her going to the olympics and the high possibility of receiving a gold but im more proud of her with regard to giving back thats one of the things we try to teach our kids

614282 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
614283 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
614284 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
614285 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area

614288 nein es ist nicht so dass da dieses blutr nstige wesen nach oben kommt und wild nach irgendwelcher nahrung schnappt
614289 stimmt nicht er riecht fischblut menschliches blut bedeutet ihm gar nichts

614292 das wiederum w rde das plankton im meer bedrohen und das produziert 70 prozent des sauerstoffs auf der erde
614293 der wei e hai gilt unter experten bereits als biologisch ausgestorben
614294 die natur hat da eine art fortpflanzungsbremse eingebaut gerade weil haie so perfekte raubtiere sind
614295 in der geschwindigkeit in der wir diese tiere ausrotten haben sie keine chance den bestand zu erhalten
614296 da haie schwierig zu t ten sind schneidet man ihnen die flossen bei lebendigem leib ab
614297 sie schreien ja nicht dann wirft man sie einfach wieder ins wasser wo sie elend verrecken
614298 wir waren in costa rica und standen in lagerr umen wo die flossen getrocknet werden da hingen in trockengestellen die flossen von ein bis eineinhalb millionen tiere man muss sich das vorstellen diese tiere sind unentbehrlich f r das kosystem meer und sie werden get tet f r einen teller suppe ich habe mich gesch mt ein mensch zu sein
614299 die machen das als lebensunterhalt die menschen die haifischflossensuppe essen die sind es die das t ten ausl sen

614301 wenn sie einem wei en hai unter wasser begegnen kriegen sie ehrfurcht die tiere sind ans u boot ran geschwommen haben uns mit gro en neugierigen augen angeguckt und da habe ich gesehen dass das auge gar nicht schwarz ist sondern dunkelblau
614302 dann ist man eigentlich viel zu nah dran wenn man das sieht aber es ist ein faszinierendes erlebnis mal f r einige sekunden im mittelpunkt der aufmerksamkeit eines gro en wei en hais zu stehen
614303 dann kommen die sechs meter langen tiere schon mal und sto en einen an nach dem motto was bist du denn eigentlich und das ist bei einem so gro en tier nicht ganz lustig also da geht man dann sofort aus dem wasser und trinkt mindestens zwei whisky danach aber es ist die gr te faszination berhaupt ein tier mit einer solchen aura erleben zu d rfen leider wird unsere generation die letzte sein die diese tiere sieht

614308 there is perhaps nothing more important than someones individual style and personality the new t mobile sidekick with its customizable shells lets our customers easily express that unique style directly on their phone
614309 providing our customers with options to stand out from the crowd and show a true expression of themselves is what makes this sidekick such an intriguing fun device

614324 para ese tiempo ya ten a como 14 a os y cuando termin la primaria me dijeron que ya no pod a seguir donde ellos
614325 yo siempre he confiado en el nuevo diario y sab a desde un comienzo que josu recibir a ayuda por parte de ustedes si no hubiera sido por eso su mam no lo hubiera reconocido adem s s que ya han resuelto muchos casos parecidos
614326 pudo haber un recalentamiento en las l neas y como uni n fenosa corta el fluido a las ocho y media de la noche a lo mejor cuando regres la energ a se pudo haber producido un cortocircuito

614328 porque era una llamarada espesa y negra que sal a muy focalizada como si se estuviera quemando un tanque enorme con gasolina
614329 estamos hablando casi del cinco por ciento de las exportaciones lo que es muy serio
614330 hay que tener libre acceso a la calle que sale del supermercado la colonia de ciudad jard n y va dando la vuelta y muchas veces no son los comerciantes la que la congestionan sino los taxistas que se paran en la esquina a esperar pasajeros creo que esa calle debe ser paso libre y que si el pasajero quiere abordar un taxi que vaya a tomarlo a unos 300 metros
614331 tambi n hay que dejar libre la calle 15 de septiembre y el padre de la iglesia el calvario me dice que los feligreses ya no pueden entrar al templo porque est rodeado de tramos y la otra es la avenida que va de la casa ricardo morales avil s antigua mansi n somoza hacia el lago el d a que se vean circulando libremente esas calles usted puede opinar que el mercado oriental dio su primer respiro
614332 si en la alcald a permitimos que se vuelvan a congestionar estas zonas y que para desgracia puede resultar en beneficio de la mayor a de los comerciantes estar amos cometiendo de nuevo un suicidio
614333 esto todo mundo lo sab a pero no podemos hacer nada porque est n prohibidos los desalojos se da mucho el fen meno de que los hijos de esos comerciante aparecen con su carret n despu s van los nietos y se van colocando uno tras a otro
614334 meternos al barrio los ngeles para hacer un cerco comercial y as vayamos sacando a los comerciantes que est n dentro hacia la periferia y que el mercado se convierta en un anillo y al centro queden artesan as restaurantes y otros
614335 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas

614340 we train these firefighters to fight fires how to extract victims out of cars and rapelling to rescue victims in dangerous situations
614341 before the classes were requested by the departments and students would come when they could to take certain courses
614342 the advantages of having the classes all together allows the students to get their required training in a shorter period of time
614343 it helps with my confidence when i approach a scene
614344 i apply what i learn here and take that back when i am working to save a life or help on a medical scene
614345 for me the rescue work has been a different experience for me
614346 being out in the woods is different but great training for this region
614347 this is a one time deal for me at the academy
614348 it provides every class i need from start to finish

614353 they say there is nowhere to put the barrels and it looks ugly
614354 it wont be over for either club obviously because mathematically youre still a chance of getting there
614355 were both in the same situation were in the same situation we were last week before we played souths and nothings going to change with a win this weekend its just that a loss will make it very very difficult
614356 hes a man of few words but his track record and physical presence on the field is a huge boost for everybody
614357 we want a home semi we want a top four spot
614358 we will be playing semi final football but we want to make sure we give ourselves the best shot at it by being in the top four
614359 we were in that position last year when we were worried about what team was going to win or lose or what points they were on
614360 if we keep thinking about that next week and worrying about our own footy and just make sure were slowly improving in areas of our game and winning those games that just keep punching us up the table a bit thats the most comfortable position you can be in
614361 more than 180 palestinians from fatah were authorised to take refuge in israel twenty two of them were wounded and were hospitalised
614362 our position on principle is that we work with and aid those among the palestinians who struggle against radical islam who oppose terrorism and who favour negotiations
614363 this is why we take this position when these palestinians are in distress and asking to go to abbass headquarters in ramallah where they will participate in the struggle against hamas
614364 we are better prepared this time to perform in malaysia and we have deep respect for the culture it is about the music not about sexy we are going to respect the people of this country and the culture
614365 i just have to thank everyone for helping me come so far ive had such an amazing time in asia
614366 i cant say anything about it yet but there is a possibility that i will be singing there
614367 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
614368 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
614369 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
614370 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
614371 we received 47 civilians who were injured in the blast and so far five have died in the hospital three of them women
614372 its the largest number of civilians we have received from one incident in weeks
614373 yesterday evening abu mazen abbas and palestinian prime minister salam fayyad made a request for israel to allow them to cross into israel and then to hospitals and the west bank
614374 shortly afterwards israeli defence minister ehud barak was contacted again by abbas who asked him to allow all of them to return to gaza
614375 those who are accused of breaking the law will be investigated and if they are found to be guilty will be brought to justice those who are proved innocent will be released
614376 confirms these people are breaking the law because they prefer to surrender themselves to the israeli occupation than to stay in their homes
614377 our position on principle is that we work with and aid those among the palestinians who struggle against radical islam who oppose terrorism and who favour negotiations
614378 ok vera we get it bedding dishes lingerie bags and oh yeah bridal gowns
614379 is a company of integrity it is an extremely good corporate citizen
614380 quite unfounded we do not and we would not and we would stop any of our employees doing it
614381 have any detailed knowledge of the day to day activities
614382 a 240 page internal report on international cigarette smuggling compiled in 1997 by italys tax and customs police the guardia di finanza
614383 at least 50 containers a month primarily marlboros philip morriss leading brand would be sent to warehouses in montenegrin ports of zelenika bar and katar
614384 specifically euphemisms for smuggled that is not to say that there are not times where dnp would be the same as smuggled in one market
614385 any case which depends on taking sentences out of eight million pages is absurd
614386 gozo has a completely different and unique identity but word about its special character is simply not out yet
614387 kempinski is europes oldest luxury hotel group which practically guarantees the quality of services and facilities but the destination itself is of at least equal importance and there is still a lot of work to be done in order to put gozo on the map for discerning travellers and event organisers
614388 when the napalm hit our village many people were still sleeping in their homes
614389 those who survived the flames ran to the tidal flats we were trying to show the american pilots that we were civilians but they strafed us women and children
614390 we should not ignore or conceal the deaths of unarmed civilians that resulted not from the mistakes of a few soldiers but from systematic aerial bombing and strafing
614391 history teaches us that we need an alliance but that alliance should be based on humanitarian principles
614392 we thank the american troops for saving our country from communism for the peace and prosperity we have today
614393 does that mean we have to shut up about what happened to our families
614394 the mission was to saturate the area so thoroughly with napalm that all installations on that area would be burned
614395 but the flashes observed on the ground indicated the intensity of the fire to be accurate enough to destroy any about
614396 methodical destruction of dwellings and other buildings forward of front lines which are or susceptible of being utilized by the enemy for shelter
614397 methodical burning out poor farmers when no enemy is present is against the grain of u s soldiers
614398 when the napalm hit the entrance the blast and smoke knocked out kerosene and castor oil lamps we had in the cave
614399 it was a pitch black chaos people shouting for each other stampeding choking some said we should crawl in deeper covering our faces with wet cloth some said we should rush out through the blaze those who were not burned to death suffocated
614400 the americans pushed us back toward the enemy area and then bombed us
614401 if you say these killings were not deliberate and were mistakes how can you explain the fact that there were so many of these incidents
614402 we are hearing from the launch control center that there has been an anomaly on that vehicle
614403 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit
614404 unfortunately a problem occurred with stage separation causing the stages to be held together this is under investigation
614405 the explorers flight mission appears not to have reached orbit tonight
614406 spacex will not skip a beat in execution going forward
614407 we are in very good financial basis here we have the resolve we have the financial base and we have the expertise
614408 we will have more than sufficient funding on hand to continue launching
614409 were not asking for a president to answer his own e mail
614410 were asking for a president who understands the context of what e mail means
614411 mr lincolns t mails the untold story of how abraham lincoln used the telegraph to win the civil war
614412 i dont think its so much a question of what a president is doing today
614413 its a question of how responsive are you to the fact that there will be continuing technological change during your term
614414 all creation is a mine and every man a miner
614415 i am forcing myself let me put it this way i am using the computer more and more every day
614416 constantly showing them to me as the news breaks during the day
614417 she even does my boarding passes people can do that now
614418 when we go to the movies she gets the tickets ahead of time its incredible
614419 you dont actually have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country
614420 theres a certain tempo to the thinking of someone who uses all kinds of new media
614421 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
614422 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
614423 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
614424 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
614425 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
614426 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
614427 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
614428 has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades
614429 it would be a mistake a misinterpretation to think that a huge rollback or reversal of fundamental trends is under way
614430 distance and trade costs do matter but we are still in a globalized era
614431 theres just a handful of us left but it has become easier for us domestic folks to compete
614432 this is not just about steel but also maple syrup and avocados and blueberries at the grocery store
614433 avocado salad in minneapolis in january is just not going to work in this new world because flying it in is going to make it cost as much as a rib eye
614434 being green is in their best interests not so much in making money as saving money
614435 green companies are likely to be a permanent trend as these vulnerabilities continue but its going to take a long time for all this to settle down
614436 cannot take a risk that the just in time system wont function because the whole global trading system is based on that notion
614437 they are going to have to have redundancies in the supply chain like more warehousing and multiple sources of supply and even production
614438 these jellyfish near shore are a message the sea is sending us saying look how badly you are treating me
614439 we need to take care of it for our tourism industry but the big problem is not on the beach its whats happening in the seas
614440 human caused stresses including global warming and overfishing are encouraging jellyfish surpluses in many tourist destinations and productive fisheries
614441 in the past few years the dynamic has changed completely the temperature is a little warmer
614442 creating a natural barrier that keeps the jellies from the coast
614443 im a little afraid to go back in the water
614444 right now i cant tell if i have hands or not they hurt theyre numb they itch
614445 we are just trying to provide whats already out there in an easier fashion for free
614446 i went to traffic school so this wouldnt appear on my record im in shock this blows me away
614447 i dont necessarily want you all knowing that im a fast driver
614448 congress made the judgment that after a certain period of time people shouldnt be harmed by having convictions stick with them forever and ever
614449 i think people generally understand the 21st century reality that this type of public information is going to be widely available
614450 is another indication of the inevitability of the democratization of public information online
614451 we are not effectively reaching men who have sex with men and african americans to lower their risk
614452 c d c s new incidence estimates reveal that the h i v epidemic is and has been worse than previously known
614453 therefore there are roughly 225 000 more people living with h i v in the u s than previously suspected
614454 the previous estimate was 1 million to 1 1 million
614455 u s efforts to prevent h i v have failed dismally
614456 this paper has been scrutinized by some of the best statisticians in the country and is much better now than when we started this process it was so complicated that even i who has some expertise in this area could not stand by it without making sure we had gone through the review process
614457 this is one of those examples where getting the external review process to really scrutinize the paper pick it apart build it back up has in my opinion fundamentally improved it
614458 h i v prevention has been underfunded and too often hindered by politics and ideology
614459 since fiscal year 2002 when adjusted for inflation c d c s prevention budget has actually shrunk by 19 percent the president has recently requested decreases in funding for h i v prevention at c d c
614460 less and less money to actually get these programs to the communities that need them
614461 it looks like prevention campaigns make even less difference than anyone thought
614462 h i v incidence did not decline as much from the 1980s to the 1990s as we believed
614463 despite the dramatic increase in condom promotion and so called prevention education
614464 if there is any good news here it is hard to report it but there is a little bit in the sense that while incidence rates are certainly too high they are stable that is important because a stable number of new infections in a world that has got more and more people with h i v and people with aids living in it suggests that we are keeping up with that pressure for transmission
614465 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
614466 across the spectrum of biothreats we have expanded our capacity significantly
614467 i think its an important risk but frankly im more concerned about bombs and guns which are easily available and can be very destructive
614468 one well placed student technician or senior scientist no cost with the salary being provided courtesy of the u s taxpayer and no risk no difficulty
614469 adherence to institute safety procedures by laboratory personnel is lax
614470 you can never say that the system is 100 percent secure
614471 but the research ethic today is one of much greater discipline and focus on security than was true prior to the anthrax attacks
614472 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
614473 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
614474 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
614475 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
614476 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
614477 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
614478 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
614479 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
614480 he didnt talk he didnt understand anything he stayed curled up in a ball but he was alive
614481 i said sure what can come of such a case
614482 then it took on a life of its own they probably regret they ever called me
614483 the question to be answered is if the patients condition is terminal
614484 we arrived for a visit and he said to me you are montejo
614485 the real problem is if we find an underlying problem and now we have six of them six patients who showed up in renal failure and that we are now seeing three times a week for dialysis
614486 a community hospital is going to give care but is it the right thing we have a lot of american citizens who need our help we only make about 3 percent over our bottom line if were lucky we need to make capital improvements and do things for our community
614487 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do
614488 and if the rehab worked then luis might have become a functional person and nobodys charge
614489 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year 10 years 50 years
614490 informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state wont assume responsibility for his charges
614491 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes
614492 this case is not simply a case as some would try and paint it of money this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government
614493 your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly
614494 why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you
614495 as aquinas once stated the good is not the enemy of the perfect
614496 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty
614497 that facility could have taken care of me any day
614498 telling everyone that he was from miami florida and showing them his toy cat
614499 that he would be staying with his new friends in guatemala and that i was leaving
614500 its the same as the classic fall on the stairs right
614501 you go to my home you fall on my stairs and then you sue me i am responsible
614502 how could i possibly have given him what he needs
614503 he was lying in the hallway on a stretcher covered in his own excrement
614504 so we cleaned him up and we brought him home
614505 its a letter that says listen dont take action to dump this individual because youll be risking legal action
614506 should they win we would like them to take those damages and pay his hospital bill
614507 they chose the wrong way to deal with it the right way would have been through the legislature there is no program in place to appropriately distribute care to undocumented persons who are catastrophically injured and there should be but you dont stick a brain injured immigrant on a private plane and spirit him out of the country in the predawn hours
614508 the first striking thing was his disposition he was very very happy
614509 then the second thing he was well cared for what i did was i got down over him and hugged him but also smelled and there were no bedsores nothing was malodorous
614510 i said his quality of life is better than it would be in an american nursing home
614511 but i hazarded a guess that his longevity of existence was probably severely curtailed
614512 there was no real compelling reason to think of bringing him back to florida
614513 we needed to focus on getting help to him or him to help in guatemala
614514 for many years i am caring for him like he is a baby changing his diaper washing him but this is worse i am worried to leave him alone at all
614515 the day my mother is no longer whats going to happen to me
614516 i headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back bent over determined to better himself
614517 other people had things so i thought why not me but now i regret it maybe god was punishing me for my illusions
614518 thats the usual story of patients that are released from the national orthopedic hospital
614519 in cases like that if you cut the medical care youre hurting that person
614520 youre doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do that goes against every international convention of human rights and health to send him to guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that and thats not fair
614521 it would be possible to set up a good health care arrangement for him because in private practice we have all types of specialties that he needs
614522 i am sending you some little things luis i hope that you like them
614523 that we miss you and love you a lot may god continue to bless you
614524 the next time youre in line at the grocery store and youre thinking you old geezer hurry up just think about how this felt
614525 we all started sharing experiences and realizing things that we perceived as discrimination
614526 they dont see a need we cant even get aarp
614527 they said that could be my mother or that could be my grandma
614528 you guys just aged to the point of going into a nursing home
614529 what did you give up all your loved ones all your privileges and at most nursing homes you only get to bring two possessions
614530 how many of you look forward to living in a typical nursing home
614531 but this is what we do to people if weve taken everything away what have we done to the elders in society
614532 then it was between my husband and my kids i gave up my husband i got very emotional with that
614533 its really important to have as much sensitivity training as possible we dont know what its like to lose our faculties the better we can understand the more effective we can be with our residents
614534 you can have this pain and disability at any stage its not just limited to the elderly
614535 that could be what it feels like to experience a stroke
614536 your dominant side doesnt work youre fearful theres a lot of anxiety
614537 so is this what its going to look like when i get up there
614538 la gran ventaja que permit a solventar bastantes escollos resid a en el dinero y ella lo ten a a raudales
614539 doctor tengo dinero a raudales donde reside la ventaja que le va a permitir solventarme bastantes escollos los de la barriga cervecera las cartucheras o estos escollos en forma de lorza que se me acumulan en la zona lumbar
614540 no hay nada peor que esforzarte por hacer tuyo el cuerpo de una persona y obtener a cambio su alma
614541 from the governments point of view its an expeditious way to collect revenue but it circumvented the legal process
614542 s lo intranquilizar a la poblaci n y generar conflictos
614543 el sentimiento y el mensaje del pueblo chuquisaque o es de paz y unidad sin embargo al mismo tiempo debo expresarle que existe un pedido claro en sentido de que su excelencia morales pida disculpas a la poblaci n y a las familias de los muertos y heridos
614544 by humility and the fear of the lord are riches honour and life
614545 in the u s it is pretty clear that the number of augmentation procedures has declined year over year
614546 people definitely remain interested especially in breast augmentation and non surgical procedures but they are shopping around more
614547 were very excited to have people come and take a look at nasas history
614548 weve been able to take a wide range of material and weave it into a virtual tour that allows people to explore at their own pace
614549 it represents a new communications medium for us and we have been fortunate to get the support of a lot of people that has enabled us to include some recognizable historic figures as part of this interactive commemoration
614550 the past present amp future of amateur radio this promised to be very enlightening

614562 i back flipped off the mattress they slept on me on
614563 if there was security in the south why would we come here
614564 we will stay here even for 10 years until the bombardment ends
614565 do you know the taliban entered kandahar city and broke into the prison
614566 there were armored vehicles on the hill and they were firing there was a heavy bombardment and planes bombed too
614567 they did not differentiate between the guilty and not guilty
614568 we left our houses because we had no power to resist the taliban or the government
614569 anytime the taliban fired a shot from our houses then the coalition the government and the police came to the area and hit us
614570 the government comes and arrests us and then the taliban come and arrest us as well
614571 there was fighting in the village a hundred times roadside bombs bombardment firing and shooting
614572 the taliban are coming during the night with heavy weapons riding on vehicles and we cannot even dare ask them to leave because if they see someone at night outside they will slaughter them and accuse them of being spies
614573 his mother was cooking and he was lying beside her
614574 the whole village was destroyed and after that we left
614575 we dont know from which side they fired but we heard that
614576 if the taliban fire from over there do you come and bomb this village
614577 we only want a stable country whether with the taliban or the foreigners
614578 if they kill if they wound innocent people we dont want them
614579 if they build and bring peace we will accept them
614580 what if the boom doesnt stop what might that signify about the changing shape of the artworld and what are the consequences of this for art making for the role it plays in contemporary culture and for the possibility of a critical art in a scene increasingly dominated by the gravitational pull of arts commercial systems
614581 in order to get beyond racism we must first take account of race
614582 john mccain has always been opposed to government mandated hiring quotas because he believes that regardless of race ethnicity or gender the law should be equally applied

614594 la se ora tomayko puede ser una persona encantadora pero ella es excelente en eso que llamamos contar un cuento
614595 una persona que ha dedicado su vida y gastado una fortuna por reencontrarse con su hija

614597 ella sabe lo que hizo tendr que vivir con eso

614609 el pr ximo a o ese camino ser como la romer a m s lento y probablemente m s dif cil pero tenemos razones para estar porque hemos construido nuestra casa sobre roca y no sobre arena
614610 en situaciones dif ciles se crean oportunidades para dar el salto costa rica tiene que producir sus alimentos y buscar alternativas al petr leo
614611 no se puede aceptar que se ensanche la brecha entre ricos y pobres que por descuido pereza o ego smo se declare en abandono a ni os y ancianos que no solo se discrimine sino que se criminalice al migrante
614612 abusos del ser humano violencias en su contra como lo son la corrupci n en las distintas estructuras de servicio la inseguridad del vivir cotidiano y el no respetar la naturaleza perjudicando a la mayor a y el futuro de costa rica para la ventaja econ mica inmediata de unos pocos
614613 se lo contamos al conductor pero el no le dio mucha importancia
614614 la nataci n es un proceso largo que requiere esfuerzo y dedicaci n estamos viviendo una revoluci n en el deporte costarricense las cosas ser n mejores
614615 nadie es invencible pero por la manera en que estaba jugando todos pensamos que no iba a perder en el futuro cercano
614616 intent no pensar en su racha de victorias y en cu l ser a su nuevo lugar en el ranquin intent concentrarme solo en mi juego
614617 de momento el paso est cerrado porque es peligroso estos apoyos que tiene la estructura dan el balance al puente para que no se fracture
614618 ese oficial observ que un tr iler iba pasando cuando la estructura cedi y casi tuvo un accidente
614619 vengo de santa ana y voy para colorado a cargar cal y ahora no me queda otra que esperar hasta que abran el paso esto deja p rdidas econ micas e incomodidades porque no hay un lugar donde comprar comida
614620 mi pap est muy orgulloso de mis logros como t cnico yo no me arrepiento de lo que pas aquella fue una buena decisi n porque hoy tengo mi carrera universitaria y una vida feliz y tranquila
614621 yo primero soy educador f sico y despu s entrenador de futbol un formador que todos los d as trabaja para buscar el orden el respeto y la disciplina hay xito en la vida no porque me tomo tragos con el directivo por eso no estoy en equipos importantes del pa s
614622 a mi me marcaron mis estudios en europa para mejorar mi visi n del futbol pero bad me ayud en la parte sicol gica del juego del manejo del futbol como actividad colectiva y sentido de grupo en los que el aspecto mental juega un papel important simo
614623 lo que m s me preocupa para el mundial es mejorar el nivel de las jugadoras ellas deben entender que esto no es una aventura esto es trabajo respeto y lucha tienen la oportunidad de seguir marcando historia
614624 el grupo del 2001 es el reflejo de lo que debe ser un equipo de futbol estaba formado por buenas personas y deportistas ordenados disciplinados y muy respetuosos aquella selecci n en trinidad fue exitosa por eso
614625 ellas van por el camino del equipo de hombres del 2001 un grupo de muchachas que entendi que esto es un juego de equipo y no hay campo para las malacrianzas y las malas caras se gana y se pierde como equipo
614626 whats so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds chairs tables communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside
614627 emptied by the danes of their contents after world war ii to salvage the scrap iron and electrical devices that were needed
614628 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
614629 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
614630 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
614631 in a way this discovery can be compared to tutankhamuns tomb almost a century ago it has to be preserved and to blow up the bunkers as some have suggested would be like denying that world war ii ever existed
614632 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
614633 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
614634 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
614635 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war
614636 home cooking world music festival has kicked off on via grimaldi in this town its time to do the film meme
614637 blood and politics history of the white nationalist movement from the margins to the mainstream
614638 think a black man in the oval office would drive millions of whites into their movement and possibly even set off the race war they have dreamed of for so many years
614639 no way im not going to vote for somebody i consider a traitor to our american heritage
614640 if i were going to vote it would probably be third party
614641 they know my beliefs but i treat everybody like i want to be treated
614642 wild card you dont know what hes going to do he either fixes things or they stay the same if they get worse hell racially polarize the nation which will bring more people to our side
614643 regardless of how you choose to live you cant live so bad that god says to you youre no longer mine
614644 faith must of course be sincere it must be a faith that performs good works through love if faith lacks love it is not true faith thus the apostle bars the way of hypocrites to the kingdom of christ on all sides idle faith is not justifying faith in this terse manner paul presents the whole life of a christian inwardly it consists in faith towards god outwardly in love towards our fellow men
614645 the reformers saw saving faith as necessarily inevitably and immediately yielding the fruit of works martin luther insisted that the faith that justifies is a fides viva a vital and living faith that yields the fruit of works
614646 the faith that justifies is a vital and living faith that yields the fruit of works
614647 hillary wasnt supposed to die before me i never imagined this could happen to me

614669 they dont think were with it were still with it
614670 youve got to dazzle the grandkids once in a while this will surprise them
614671 at the end of the month i take and post the top players for the month
614672 it is a great game and i find that its one of those games that any age can play ive seen grandchildren children of the residents play
614673 the look of the peoples faces who play they all enjoy it
614674 its not the exercise because you dont get that much exercise
614675 the nice thing about the game is that anybody can play
614676 and yet she bowls and bowls well into the hundreds
614677 its really a therapy for a lot of these people
614678 the only difference is youre not throwing a 16 pound ball
614679 if i bowl a 150 im well out of my league
614680 i dont think the creators had any idea that seniors would take this and make it their own
614681 its great because people who werent doing sports and activities are now taking part in it
614682 i wonder how long it will be until they go out and get their own wii
614683 i think the camaraderie of them coming together is definitely one of the benefits
614684 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
614685 eric had a dose equivalent to 190 years of background radiation
614686 johns was 107 the mods maximum safe dose was just 30
614687 hopefully this will mean they have to admit everything else
614688 there were 20 000 others there they and their families suffered just as badly
614689 in reality they have no idea who had how much dose eric and john had records taken but most had none those who had film badges for the explosions were made to hand them in and they were never labelled to show who was wearing them
614690 please its not a podcasting or boke service which could be subscribed to and downloaded automatically to your ipod its a youtube clone the idea of podcasting has been distorted by sina i dont like sinas supremacy at all
614691 it felt like everything i was throwing they were hitting
614692 most companies erroneously focus on competition and on differentiation from their competitors
614693 is to enable a creative environment where theres a good degree of experimentation
614694 how much energy and creativity might be unlocked if all the members of an organization felt in control
614695 it breaks down the walls of isolation and streamlines collaboration i dont think innovation can occur without having that diversity in geography and experience
614696 the recession were seeing in the united states is affecting las vegas more this time around than in any previous cycle
614697 what am i doing opening one of these places in a bad economy
614698 you saw all of these other people come out to las vegas and say well just knock off a fully integrated destination resort
614699 whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa who said that is the luxury market
614700 the luxury market in las vegas is bellagio and wynn period you can look at the average room rate were in one category and theyre a notch down
614701 everybody says theyre fancy and beautiful but the question is who is delivering five star service
614702 unlike sands and mgm investors arent really that concerned about wynns balance sheet
614703 sure i wish it was a boom time you like to open up when everybody is ripping and roaring
614704 what ive realized in the years that ive been married to him is that if you dont share his life you get left behind
614705 a guy like steve doesnt mellow out he still has his explosions but they pass quickly
614706 steve is an aquarius his feet are off the ground
614707 the thrill for him is still creating he loves the design element of this and he is quite brilliant at inspiring the staff
614708 we didnt overreach were not building 12 hotels at once
614709 i think weve bitten off something we can chew how it shakes out only time will tell
614710 so the trick is finding a way to differentiate yourself
614711 they were 5 percent to 12 percent below a year ago
614712 people may still come to vegas but they dont have to spend 300 a plate on a dinner or hotel room
614713 my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations
614714 wurlitzer 1 i made it for the jukebox lorne gave me which plays ipods but tonight i took it with me in the car and it was great an era in time what great records these were

614716 i am not going in there rani theres bloody dildos in there
614717 janu stop being such a pussy i need you to help me out here
614718 you know what why would i look nice for that pig am going to look ugly for him why should i let him enjoy me it is going to be rape after all
614719 dont worry about it its ok i have been taking contraceptive and we can even have sex now
614720 i thought you were smarter then that things could have been different but ive moved on the last thing i need is you back into my life
614721 even if hes busy the next weekend he will acknowledge his busyness and mention that he wants to see you at some point
614722 he only calls from restricted numbers and because you dont know his last name address mother or best friend you cannot call
614723 birthdays and anniversaries become painful reminders that time is racing by and nothing has changed
614724 you shouldnt discuss your respective dating lives if hes not connected to you he will forget about you whenever youre apart
614725 if hes into you he will be interested in your home your friends your life if there is no interest it is not a relationship
614726 if you do all the calling hes not that invested step back and put yourself on phone restriction if hes interested hell call if hes not he wont
614727 if hes not willing to meet your family and friends
614728 it is because he does not envision himself being a part of your life

614750 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
614751 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months

614756 would literally take away with one hand what has been given with the other
614757 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
614758 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapon states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
614759 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
614760 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
614761 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
614762 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
614763 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties
614764 we seem often to be threatening death to each other not offering life
614765 we need to speak life to each other and that means change
614766 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
614767 clearly theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
614768 my granddaughter said the explosion occurred when someone turned the lights on
614769 a strong whistling sound came up from the ground floor

614773 governmental stability because israel is facing large existential security challenges
614774 i wouldnt recommend that anyone predict the future on the basis of the polls
614775 it is a matter of the mood and it will change i am certain that i will win the primary
614776 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza
614777 the question of power has been settled by the elections
614778 it should be stressed that executive power will remain with the elected president
614779 when you face these kinds of global problems you need as prime minister someone who is respected
614780 someone whose hard work and ability over the last 11 years has made britain better off

614782 political mountain to climb in order to win the next election
614783 we have a multitude of small policies and worthy initiatives that are more suited to a sunday afternoon stroll
614784 we must come forward with bold and ambitious policies that begin to change the terms of political debate by putting labour on the front foot and the tories on the defensive
614785 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has

614789 we want to grow the business over a three to five year period we are executing against that plan and we are still doing that despite all the stuff thats happened to us
614790 i think they had an opportunity to get something done in the palm of their hand and they bungled it
614791 i am more determined and more excited than ever to see those changes through
614792 they dont get it they dont understand the realities of their business
614793 they surprised wall street with this major investment initiative if they had announced it coming out of the 100 day review it would have been more tolerated
614794 it kind of implies a lack of confidence in the plan thats out there
614795 right from the beginning we were open to doing a deal
614796 it was simply a matter of getting the right price and getting the deal terms negotiated they started backing off early on in the process

614809 i dont think two games and two wins makes a career but its two wins and im happy to be a part of it
614810 it hasnt been a big sample size against lefthanders just havent faced a lot this year so far
614811 april was kind of a buzz saw for me i was in a funk but i never think that i dont hit lefties well because ive always hit them and i certainly feel more confident facing lefthanded pitchers
614812 i hope by the end of the year things will be where they usually are
614813 i had a rough first inning and guys come out and swing the bat really well
614814 it was nice to have a break between innings and then come out and have a nice cushion
614815 nobody has ever questioned his toughness he wants to play every day he shows up to win and tonight was a great example of that
614816 when i slow down is when i feel it grabbing not so much when im running it doesnt let me extend normally
614817 thats why were going to talk to the doctor and see what he wants to do maybe with a supersonic anti inflammatory it will come down
614818 weve tried heat stretch stim ultrasound massage weve kind of exhausted everything i dont know its just a nagging thing that hasnt gone away
614819 thankfully its not a major aspect of the game for me
614820 im not that fast to start so i really feel slow
614821 i never contacted the red sox after the deal was made
614822 both parties agreed that it was in the best interest of everyone involved for manny to move forward
614823 from my point of view in dealing with the red sox they did things in a forthright manner
614824 hes getting used to la hell do fine out there he can hit anywhere
614825 the ball was coming out of his hand on a downward plane with velocity that was good
614826 it seems like guys are turning the page and having fun obviously having jason bay over here is nice but i dont think that changed our attitudes any we all feel the same we want to win and were having fun now
614827 why not put together a page with a wall of small photos and let everyone tag themselves and add their retaggr cards
614828 is because if he swings at strikes whatever we get it doesnt necessarily have to be home runs but driving the ball in the gap hitting line drives down the left field line and shooting the ball occasionally to the right well take that thats good enough
614829 its certainly great to see a ball leave the ballpark but he hasnt sold out his swing to hit home runs hes covering the plate and i think thats just a byproduct of a lot of good swings
614830 i just got two good pitches to hit and i capitalized on them
614831 i wouldnt say its anything different i think its just were playing better baseball its always there
614832 right now were just playing some good ball and putting together good at bats pitching good
614833 winning solves a lot thats the biggest thing that we werent doing before we were in a lot of games it wasnt like we were getting blown out its just we were in games and we couldnt put it together weve got 51 games left and weve just gotta go out there and play all 51 the best we can

614844 do you know the taliban entered kandahar city and broke into the prison
614845 there were armoured vehicles on the hill and they were firing there was a heavy bombardment and planes bombed too
614846 they did not differentiate between the guilty and not guilty
614847 we left our houses because we had no power to resist the taliban or the government
614848 anytime the taliban fired a shot from our houses then the coalition the government and the police came to the area and hit us the government comes and arrests us and then the taliban come and arrest us as well
614849 if they kill if they wound innocent people we dont want them
614850 if they build and bring peace we will accept them

615061 you learn that the show starts when you open your door the show stops when you close your door and youre always on
615062 we all mostly women lined up and when he gets to you he takes your hand and makes eye contact after he leaves and he moves on to the next person he looks back at you and seals the deal
615063 when i got home i expected to have a message from him and i didnt i bet women across america expect it too
615064 john has such an amazing crew of musicians and friends with him everyone gets along and is drama free and jen fits right in perfectly everyone really loves her
615065 with recent reports showing that one out of four teenage girls has an std sexually transmitted disease and the high level of teenage pregnancy we believe that miley is both influential and relatable to this afflicted set and is the obvious choice to get the message of safe sex out to teens across america
615066 i kissed sarah jessica parker i played a lesbian in sex and the city and i had to kiss her i have experimented with same sex relationships in my life but it wasnt about enjoyment with sarah jessica
615067 universal could have moved forward with one of these challenges but the confluence of the three caused the studio to reconsider and take the time for all conditions to be optimal
615068 i dont feel him presley in a way that i feel i have to call ghostbusters but ive been haunted by the sense that when i knew him he was very sweet but also seriously into drugs
615069 we are always going to be an imperfect weird and geeky outfit we were that way to begin with and to a large degree always will be
615070 camille was patting my head and she said thats when you looked up at me and said im going now and then off i went
615071 as i lay there dying i inner spirit said to them please i cannot do this i dont wanna see anything i dont wanna see any light i dont wanna have any little adventures that make me wanna get out of this life
615072 all the pictures of me and em i burned them so there aint no proof i walked through 8 mile
615073 everybody thinks its so bizarre because a white kid has never been at the top of food chain eminems a talented motherf ker and nobody can f k with the white dude
615074 if barack obama loses i really will feel sorry and sad for the state of america
615075 our position on principle is that we work with and aid those among the palestinians who struggle against radical islam who oppose terrorism and who favour negotiations

615081 the bishops should not come home until the they have affirmed the normative family headed by one man and one woman that children are to
615082 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
615083 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
615084 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
615085 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
615086 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
615087 what matters is that we get a clear answer quickly its not a matter of one day
615088 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
615089 he opened the side door of the car lit a match threw it inside and walked away
615090 this was given to me to give to you when you returned
615091 if i ever get recruited i promise to fight for the innocent who cant fight for themselves and for the united states of america
615092 i want everyone to know i have no regrets i was doing what i wanted to do ever since i was a kid
615093 she can talk to her if she ever feels like she needs a drink
615094 answer this one simple question have you hit your bottom
615095 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
615096 if you look at obamas tax plan with a few variations its essentially john kerrys plan from 2004
615097 told me that he knew of a house where protestors were accumulating urine we are trying to ban these things in advance so we can actually confiscate the materials ahead of time
615098 theres not anything out there that anybody is very proud of
615099 for years they slashed station cleaning and they slashed station maintenance
615100 move stations to a state of daily maintenance worthy of our riders
615101 were not doing as many rehabs and we have very limited capacity to maintain and clean the stations we do have
615102 we really do not have the funding to do a first class job
615103 when something looks decrepit it looks like management doesnt care about their riders
615104 youd need a script and a voice over and then youre good to go it might cost anywhere from 10 000 to 15 000 to make an ad like that
615105 thats just the nature of some campaign media these days you dont have to spend a ton of money to put them out there and theres multiple audiences for this stuff
615106 then i saw these guys at least 30 of them there was a man on the ground they had his head against the pole
615107 he didnt look like a rockefeller i thought maybe he had been thrown out of the van
615108 she was on the fbi womans hip she was calm she wasnt crying
615109 daddy left me alone but these nice people came to get me
615110 she fainted dead away she was overjoyed though and she asked me to say thank you to the media and the police and the fbi and everybody who brought her daughter home safely
615111 it was one of the best moments of my career
615112 he was apprehended as soon as he walked out of the building
615113 she was just trying to get her daughter away from those people
615114 bianca sat and listened and tried to ignore it until it got too much for her and then she told nikki to shut her mouth
615115 i dont want to sit next to any white bitch
615116 its hard to imagine that with tighter management they couldnt shave off about 20 or 30 million off the top
615117 i think key to all of our recommendations was wanting to see a more porous relationship between the department of education and district 75 as far as how it functions at the top of the system all the way on down to the classrooms as far as integrating kids
615118 all of our principals all of our schools are expected to support students with disabilities
615119 foram precisos os psicodramas da universidade moderna e da universidade independente para que a opini o p blica tomasse consci ncia da situa o do ensino universit rio
615120 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
615121 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids

615124 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
615125 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
615126 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
615127 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
615128 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
615129 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
615130 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
615131 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
615132 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
615133 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
615134 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
615135 has the u s ever used religion to instill a sense of patriotism or even nationalism
615136 should koizumi be allowed to worship publicly in such a ambiguous setting

615140 its been a success on the soccer side its moved forward weve gotten the interest in the league that weve wanted to which has brought success
615141 if you bring over someone you know is injured and make hoopla about it and try to get the non mls fan and all youve got is beckham injured you just lay an egg they deserve failing because they set themselves up to fail
615142 it was a smash and grab they wanted the money and season ticket sales and didnt take into consideration he was injured it was fraudulent and disingenuous to sell beckham ticket packages when he didnt play
615143 go and ask the average american sports fan about giving mls a chance this year and they say the mls overpromised and underdelivered
615144 most people who want to get ahead do it backward they think ill get a bigger job then ill learn how to be a leader but showing leadership skill is how you get the bigger job in the first place leadership isnt a position its a process
615145 leaders must be close enough to relate to others but far enough ahead to motivate them
615146 leadership is more if not much more influence rather than position
615147 our program is attuned in such a way that we intentionally want to

615170 the hebrew writer of the bible was not so well acquainted with egypt as has often been imagined
615171 d they sold joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph to egypt
615172 and josephs master took him and put him in the prison a place where the kings prisoners were confined
615173 then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his garment and came in to pharaoh
615174 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold collar about his neck
615175 and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son who is born you shall throw into the river and every daughter you shall let live
615176 and joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm his father
615177 and these are the names of the sons of israel who came to egypt
615178 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
615179 go yourselves and take for yourselves straw where you can find it but do not diminish from your work anything
615180 the lord god of the hebrews has met with us moses and aaron and now let us go we beseech you three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god
615181 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
615182 and the egyptians made the people of israel serve with rigor and they made their lives bitter with hard slavery in mortar and in brick and in all kinds of service in the field all their service which they made them serve was with rigor

615210 i miss you so much and remember youre always a princess
615211 i know a lot of people have been worried its sad that he had to lie about his life but i still dont think he would do harm to snooks
615212 at the same time its a giant weight lifted off everyones shoulders
615213 now that this whole investigation is going through its shocking people he isnt the rockefeller they thought he was
615214 its worrisome because theres so many possible outcomes i think everybody in the country just felt heartsick for
615215 its going to require a whole lot more in resources to be able to provide appropriate medical care for this additional 160 000 people
615216 i hope these new estimates do serve as a wake up call
615217 the fact remains there are too many people becoming infected with hiv every year
615218 many of us felt for some time that the methodology originally used was flawed
615219 from our perspective this is certainly indicative of poor planning and poor administration of things going on at cdc
615220 this means that cdcs ability to measure the true scope of the epidemic has improved
615221 there have never been more people living with hiv in the united states or in massachusetts and there will be more tomorrow because of our success in keeping people alive and well
615222 its only going to get worse if we dont match what were seeing with funding and evidence based prevention programs
615223 in the past couple hundred years china has felt they were looked down upon by world powers
615224 the people see the performances of the athletes in these games as a direct reflection of the strength of the country to be honest theres probably too much emphasis on performance
615225 when liu xiang can win a gold medal in one of the pure athletic events like track and field it really symbolizes to the chinese that they are not inferior
615226 a lot of what underlies chinas relationship with the outside world is a deep seated sense of inferiority thats the flip side of the ultranationalism you sometimes see
615227 they didnt know how to play hard just how to pace themselves
615228 theres no doubt about it when they start something they go at it that was one of the great pleasures of working with the team they would do anything asked of them and do it gladly they were so respectful of everything
615229 in the old days they would probably have given her shots and made sure she runs and fights to the last step
615230 now they say were not going to force her to run shes going to have a long career and a future were not going to ruin her right now they really are a lot more open
615231 i feel a little sorry for them because theyve been playing by outdated rules in some ways when it comes to national image and sports
615232 they never quite got it that winning gold medals alone doesnt mean that you have become a strong nation that can compete with other nations
615233 whether china is first place in the medal count or second place or third it probably wont make too much difference in the eyes of the rest of the world
615234 if liu xiang wins the gold medal maybe hell encourage tens of millions of kids to start hurdling in china and theyll have another guy in five years
615235 the impact coming out of the olympics might be greater than the olympics on the horizon
615236 we have a very big population in china so there must be quite some talented athletes
615237 the thing we need to do well now is find a more efficient way to find those talented athletes
615238 acara yang dihadiri sekitar seratusan umat islam surakarta itu diselenggarakan bertepatan dengan acara
615239 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
615240 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
615241 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
615242 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
615243 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
615244 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase
615245 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
615246 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
615247 via the lens provided on the world by messenger we find that there are about 7 degrees of separation among people
615248 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
615249 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
615250 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
615251 you guys just aged to the point of going into a nursing home
615252 what did you give up all your loved ones all your privileges and at most nursing homes you only get to bring two possessions
615253 how many of you look forward to living in a typical nursing home
615254 said jeffrey adamovicz former director of the bacteriology division at the army medical research institute for infectious diseases or usamriid in frederick md
615255 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
615256 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials
615257 i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it
615258 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
615259 we talked about the oil boom weddings everything under the sun
615260 but nobody ever mentioned that missile i guess that shows that people arent worried about it im certainly not
615261 a scathing indictment of how profoundly u s and cdc hiv prevention efforts have failed there is absolutely no good news here without an accurate picture of the epidemic vastly underestimated for the last 10 years we have missed countless opportunities to intervene with
615262 are one of the most severely impacted groups in the world
615263 if you are a young gay black man the likelihood that you will encounter hiv is staggeringly high even if your personal behavior is no more risky than people in other communities
615264 there are roughly 225 000 more people living with hiv in the u s than previously suspected
615265 nothing remotely like this ever happened in the nine years i was receiving police protection
615266 i simply wish to protect my reputation from a bunch of lies
615267 the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place

615291 hopefully this will mean they have to admit everything else
615292 there were 20 000 others there they and their families suffered just as badly
615293 in reality they have no idea who had how much dose eric and john had records taken but most had none those who had film badges for the explosions were made to hand them in and they were never labelled to show who was wearing them

615367 the book is an introduction to british bhangra music using the city of birmingham as a starting point to map out the journey that uk bhangra has travelled from its folk beginnings in the punjab to a fusion based music in post war britain to now in the 2000s having crossed over into the mainstream through american hip hop artistes and others using the bhangra beat and sounds
615368 british bhangra has now come full circle whereas it started off in the post war period as folk dance and music from the punjab in the present it has forged a path for itself making it quite fashionable

615370 what do i want to accomplish in the next six months
615371 bron the kids and the parents and your friends are just not going to let you go without some kind of celebration because you have been teaching for 30yrs and for 23 of those years you have been here
615372 bron you have been saying im retiring in two years since i arrived and youve seen 3 previous heads out so youll probably still be saying it after i have gone
615373 de verdachte kwam de ruimte binnenlopen en begon met de bijl op het slachtoffer in te slaan
615374 hij was aan het afstuderen in breda geloof ik hij was echt op de verkeerde tijd op de verkeerde plaats
615375 i never knew what real happiness was until i got married by then it was too late
615376 my wife has a slight impediment in her speech every now and then she stops to breathe
615377 look before you kill me will you at least tell me what this is all about
615378 but before i kill you theres just one thing i want to know
615379 my liege he is but one man what can one man possibly do
615380 ill never marry you never do you hear me never
615381 why are you risking everything on such a mad scheme
615382 and try to take him alive if it is reasonable practical
615383 align the 12 stones of power on the sacred altar then activate the medallion at the moment of total eclipse
615384 yesterday evening abu mazen abbas and palestinian prime minister salam fayyad made a request for israel to allow them to cross into israel and then to hospitals and the west bank
615385 shortly afterwards israeli defence minister ehud barak was contacted again by abbas who asked him to allow all of them to return to gaza
615386 those who are accused of breaking the law will be investigated and if they are found to be guilty will be brought to justice those who are proved innocent will be released
615387 confirms these people are breaking the law because they prefer to surrender themselves to the israeli occupation than to stay in their homes
615388 our position on principle is that we work with and aid those among the palestinians who struggle against radical islam who oppose terrorism and who favour negotiations
615389 wallahi im telling you its not haraam believe me this is what i say its all about intentions
615390 where does she get these ideas probably from america and the people she hangs around over there
615391 ive had some contact with former hawthorn coaches alan joyce and allan jeans and they talk about theres a moment in a game when someone has to go
615392 we took five marks inside 50 in the last quarter but we did attack deep and koschitzke and riewoldt took some good marks
615393 a lot of players stood up and we started getting some reward for effort
615394 you dont get any more points but youre running out of opportunities to get enough wins on the board and clearly we havent got enough yet so every week is really important
615395 we want a home semi we want a top four spot
615396 we will be playing semi final football but we want to make sure we give ourselves the best shot at it by being in the top four
615397 we were in that position last year when we were worried about what team was going to win or lose or what points they were on
615398 if we keep thinking about that next week and worrying about our own footy and just make sure were slowly improving in areas of our game and winning those games that just keep punching us up the table a bit thats the most comfortable position you can be in
615399 it wont be over for either club obviously because mathematically youre still a chance of getting there
615400 were both in the same situation were in the same situation we were last week before we played souths and nothings going to change with a win this weekend its just that a loss will make it very very difficult
615401 hes a man of few words but his track record and physical presence on the field is a huge boost for everybody
615402 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
615403 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
615404 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
615405 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
615406 we received 47 civilians who were injured in the blast and so far five have died in the hospital three of them women
615407 its the largest number of civilians we have received from one incident in weeks
615408 more than 180 palestinians from fatah were authorised to take refuge in israel twenty two of them were wounded and were hospitalised
615409 our position on principle is that we work with and aid those among the palestinians who struggle against radical islam who oppose terrorism and who favour negotiations
615410 this is why we take this position when these palestinians are in distress and asking to go to abbass headquarters in ramallah where they will participate in the struggle against hamas
615411 yes the economy is slowing yes we need to take the steam out of inflation but people talking a recession are getting way ahead of the facts mr tanner told abcs insiders tv program today
615412 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures mr tanner said
615413 that was great roflmao just great you know only 5 of guilds have even made it to supremus and getting him down to 67 on the second attempt is hawt
615414 jesus christ why are there corpses under all these goddamn volcanoes lolcats its supremus for ss sake get out of the goddamn flame
615415 so i was talking to insert name of four year old child and he says
615416 holy crap man i lold irl i was just standing and shooting and this damn volcano popped on me roflmao when did they put in those volcanoes
615417 thats not how we did it in my old guild on korgath
615418 in my old guild we ran towards the volcanoes rofl
615419 jesus christ could you please not suck next time i lold irl can we get somebody goddamn competent in here dammit
615420 de rekenkamer publiceerde in 1997 al een vernietigend rapport over de kosten van vredesoperaties de conclusie luidde toen dat defensie onvoldoende inzicht had in de totale werkelijke uitgaven voor het uitvoeren van vredesoperaties kennelijk is er niet zoveel veranderd
615421 wat begon als een opbouwmissie is verworden tot een vechtmissie defensie had hier natuurlijk rekening mee moeten houden maar dat is de kamer bij het besluit tot uitzending niet gemeld kennelijk vreesde de regering onvoldoende draagvlak voor een missie met een ander karakter
615422 een aantal direct aan de deelname aan vredesoperaties toe te schijven uitgaven ten onrechte niet als additioneel zijn aangemerkt
615423 but its mind over matter i wont scratch it and it wont spread
615424 no other large county in the state was so unfairly treated by the 2001 legislative apportionment
615425 the apportionment in mercer county and our communities has negatively impacted our ability to collectively grow and prosper

615427 the postmodern artist of writer is in the position of a philosopher the text he writes or the work he creates is not in principle governed by preestablished rules and cannot be judged
615428 presents culture as a continually mutating entity that is made up of a series of challenges and readjustments 31
615429 fictions focus on history opens up problems about the access to a true past as a way of denaturalising present ideas and institutions
615430 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
615431 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
615432 i assure you there are bases around the country that are closed today because of overdevelopment outside the gate its this type of community support which has kept the bases open
615433 will provide a blueprint for ocean and burlington counties and their towns to protect the bases from encroachment and protect the 17 000 people who work there
615434 we need to ensure that the elevated activities on the base over the next 10 years work harmoniously with the towns and their land use plans that transportation issues are addressed and that any new residential and commercial development addresses both the communities needs as well as those of the military
615435 it stands to reason that more military activity means more commercial activity in the housing market however new development into the areas closest to the base is also an issue and also has to be considered as part of the planning effort
615436 incompatible land uses such as residential housing in a flight crash zone
615437 maybe it would be better to have a warehouse or a golf course
615438 some land has been purchased were looking for other opportunities
615439 encroachment limits our ability to do the mission were here to do if we cant do our mission it will have to go elsewhere
615440 were looking for ways to benefit the bases and the people living around them
615441 wrightstown wants to complement the bases what can we build here that you need and dont want to build on the base
615442 were looking for common goals where there is a win win situation for everybody
615443 tears may flow as we take this time to honor lt jason mann
615444 hes a hero he wasnt just a hero to his family hes a hero to this country
615445 he was a wonderful wonderful son not just a wonderful marine
615446 i dont think he would want us to say he was a hero today but he loved being a marine most of all he loved his wife and daughter and we grieve that he wont be here for them
615447 mom you just need to put me in gods hands
615448 now when people ask me hows your brother doing ill say he died doing what he believed in hes being honored and remembered my brother is a hero and now he serves the lord as a family we have never felt so much pain and pride for the sacrifice my brother made
615449 en las plantaciones de tabaco de cuba los trabajadores pueden escuchar libros le dos en voz alta mientras trabajan en frica los chicos quieren libros pero no tienen ninguno y en occidente tenemos los nuevos b rbaros que quiz tras veinte a os de educaci n solamente leen revistas de computaci n esta nueva biblioteca del mundo es imprescindible en este contexto

615451 this was his second job just to pay all the bills
615452 were looking at consolidating some stops because every time the bus stops and starts you use fuel
615453 if you are eligible for a yellow school bus youre going to get the service
615454 we can do it cheaper than some of the contractors out there
615455 i could never have predicted the career ive had the good fortune ive had
615456 ive worked hard but ive also been in the right place at the right time it takes both it really does
615457 he had great presence in front of a jury and not everyone does
615458 and he didnt do it by being flamboyant he wasnt a screamer he was just very well prepared and matter of fact and focused
615459 with all due respect to my brethren in law enforcement we catch the dumb ones
615460 he should have had an independent counsel investigating this from the beginning and investigating all four caucuses
615461 and if its a republican its going to irritate me more
615462 i stand here and take it i know what were doing and were doing the right thing
615463 anyone who calls this a witch hunt is from neptune pluto or mars
615464 you can do more for the people of pennsylvania in this job than in any other government job in the state
615465 the dirty russians wanted us to fight i told my driver when we go to the yugoslavia border open the doors and put a white flag in front of our tank then we turned back to town
615466 twelve years under the communists we can do no more
615467 to me the evening has always been the best time of the day on the beach the light the birds the sounds i love it
615468 im glad that now i cant get kicked off if i want to hang out after sunset
615469 the ordinance is very narrow people can stroll or sit on the beach but thats about it
615470 i dont think they were thinking straight when they said you should have 24 hour access to the beaches
615471 i think when everyone first heard about it they really worried about what could go on in the middle of the night on the beach
615472 people are in bed in the middle of the night here
615473 maybe in towns where bars close late they could have more problems but we just dont have gangs of people running out and making noise or problems on the beach in the middle of the night
615474 it boggles my mind that ocean city doesnt understand the liability of 24 hour beach access
615475 i think that ocean city went along with it just to get a beach fill
615476 that doctrine envisions that people have the right to enjoy the beaches at all times not just 9 to 5
615477 if there are extenuating circumstances for a town not wanting to comply we are willing to work with a municipality
615478 but maintaining public access 24 7 is our primary goal
615479 she was very small but very big in what she did you know how you hear on the news when someone dies that they always helped everyone and it isnt always true
615480 if you broke your glasses somalie would fix them if you lost an earring one day i came in with one missing and she said give me your necklace the next day she came in with two new earrings made out of my necklace whatever was broke she would fix
615481 her family gave us incense and i was trying to stick my candle on the pavement it took me five minutes i said to my sister if somalie had been here shed tell us to step back and shed make a beautiful display but shed tell us very nicely and it would not make us feel bad
615482 all her painting sculpting and sewing she learned on her own
615483 as soon as you put her in a class and said you have to do it it was not fun anymore as soon as you tried to pay her for something there was no more passion

615486 when you pick up a 2 foot 8 inch human being and throw him to the floor it hurts

615488 she wasnt the kind that played with dolls and then all of a sudden she has all these kids
615489 a look that a lot of younger girls liked and copied but she has no talent

615568 insultar golpear y en ltimo caso humillar de la forma en la que se le hizo y no conformes con ello con el objetivo de eludir su responsabilidad en los acontecimientos se le acusa y se le imponen cargos sin fundamentos s lidos que son requerimiento esencial en este tipo de casos
615569 junto con lo mencionado previamente es menester mencionar y explicitar el hecho que el acusado est siendo procesado por el mismo tribunal militar regional que dej impune a los asesinos de los hermanos alex lemun y mat as katrileo por lo cual es clara la tendencia del tribunal en cuesti n
615570 son candidaturas que han contado con un gran respaldo de firmas patrocinadoras y eso nos tiene contentos en algunos casos la ley nos exig a reunir 70 firmas y se juntaron m s de 100 eso habla de un respaldo creciente
615571 penchuleo representa para nosotros un nuevo tipo de liderazgo es un joven mapuche de la zona que ha destacado como dirigente universitario y cuya elecci n como candidato fue producto de un proceso de primarias in dito entre las comunidades de la zona
615572 podemos hacer historia en lautaro existen all cerca de 300 comunidades y los avances que hemos logrado como partido nos tienen optimistas sabemos que tenemos que trabajar duro y el mandato que la gente a entregado a luis es competir para ganar
615573 el pe i mario es un lider tradicional respetado y querido por las comunidades en la zona de freire su trayectoria habla por l y estamos orgullosos de que nos represente en la contienda electoral de octubre
615574 ambas candidaturas se han formalizado bajo la modalidad de independientes y eso nos exige trabajar el doble
615575 lamentablemente el servel aun no nos autoriza iniciar la campa a de firmas para legalizarnos y esto nos ha perjudicado sin embargo estas municipales nos dar n la oportunidad de seguir socializando nuestra propuesta pol tica a nivel de base y preparando el terreno para cuando demos el vamos a la campa a que esperamos sea el segundo semestre
615576 lautaro y freire son comunas de alta poblaci n mapuche y donde est n las bases fundadoras del partido lo que esperamos con estas candidaturas es acrecentar adem s nuestra base de militantes y posicionar a wallmapuwen de cara a nuestra campa a de legalizaci n ambas comunas son emblem ticas para nosotros y esperamos que al igual como sucede hoy con luis penchuleo en lautaro sigan surgiendo desde las comunidades liderazgos j venes que refresquen la pol tica mapuche y constituyan un real aporte a nuestro pueblo

615581 no tenemos ninguna confirmaci n oficial sobre la llegada de alg n ministro o si nos van a llamar para entrevistarnos con el gobernador en la capital de la provincia por lo que nosotros nos mantenemos firmes en esa ocupaci n pac fica que es una reivindicaci n territorial

615583 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado
615584 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n

615606 i think people generally understand the 21st century reality that this type of public information is going to be widely available

615611 what do you mean no you have to trade these are trading floor rules

615632 of course such legal arguments are irrelevant the moral argument against income taxes is much more important than the legal argument
615633 waah fsk called me a pro state troll sympathize with me joey
615634 bottom line point out that fsk is missing a crucial point and hell resort to name calling while refusing to address your points point out that thats what hes doing and hell mock you for pointing it out either way his method of dealing with facts he finds unpleasant are no different than the method of a irrationalist statist so fsk is ironically the real pro state troll here hes hurting our cause not helping it

615649 temos de vestir a roupa e ir a p pelo areal normalmente at nem nos importar amos de o fazer que os naturistas gostam de andar mas agora no ver o com o calor torna se muito complicado

615658 i was about to blog on the redemption of quincy carter when i heard a huge collision on the practice field by the time i arrived former iowa state linebacker tyson smith was lying on his back two sources close to the situation revealed that cowboys running back marion barber destroyed smith during a blitz pickup drill when last seen athletic trainer britt brown was asking if smith could recall his hometown

615661 eric had a dose equivalent to 190 years of background radiation
615662 johns was 107 the mods maximum safe dose was just 30
615663 hopefully this will mean they have to admit everything else
615664 there were 20 000 others there they and their families suffered just as badly
615665 in reality they have no idea who had how much dose eric and john had records taken but most had none those who had film badges for the explosions were made to hand them in and they were never labelled to show who was wearing them

615678 later today we will have to consider the best way forward for the england team
615679 michael has been the most successful test captain england have ever had
615680 the critical thing is that will be sitting down with michael and the selectors to plot the way forward it was a significant blow to lose the series to south africa
615681 it was desperately disappointing we had high hopes after two wins in two previous tests against new zealand so clearly the selectors will be talking this through
615682 we have an incredibly important 12 months ahead of us
615683 england have now lost to three of their last four opponents so perhaps it is a good thing that this dead game presents itself as an opportunity for the selectors to take proper stock of the situation

615690 both players showed good movement and so did steven gerrard
615691 dirk kuyt and yossi benayoun were coming inside so i felt we had five offensive players very clever and with quality so we were a threat all the time
615692 keane is very clever and he worked hard he is very happy here and hopefully we will see a lot of good movement and also goals from him
615693 gerrard torres and keane playing together was one of the keys to keeping possession
615694 the first half was okay but in the second half they needed to go forward in front of their supporters
615695 we had more space and we scored the second goal on the counter attack
615696 but from the start of the game we wanted to impress and we wanted to win
615697 we worked hard had plenty of possession and wanted to keep a high tempo with the ball
615698 we scored once and had one or two problems near the end of the first half but we controlled it

615704 i thought id fall back into it naturally but at first it felt odd i was having a hard time finding scullys voice
615705 it wasnt until day three or four when i had scenes with david duchovny and we were working together again that i felt comfortable thats when i felt id come home
615706 i am in love with ronnie i should hope hes in love with me
615707 we didnt mean to fall in love you cant choose who you fall in love with people fall in love despite an age gap i fancy him because of the person he is i dont think about his age or the fact hes a rolling stone
615708 it was natural it just happened ive never felt more connected to someone it wasnt like kissing a 61 year old it was electric there was a spark
615709 whatever decision he makes when he gets out is up to him i want him to get well
615710 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
615711 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
615712 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
615713 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
615714 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
615715 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
615716 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
615717 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
615718 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
615719 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
615720 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
615721 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
615722 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
615723 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
615724 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
615725 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
615726 no disponemos de pruebas que confirmen la existencia de irregularidades en qantas pero debemos ser prudentes si las cosas ocurren debemos responder a las preocupaciones y es lo que estamos haciendo
615727 biasanya juga gak apa apa kebetulan iyan gak pake sendal
615728 tadi gak biasanya dia bercanda dikasih uang rp 35 000 buat beli sarapan pagi beli ati ampela 7 dan kerupuk iyan sempat bercanda dia bilang kita habiskan semuanya ya uang
615729 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
615730 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
615731 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
615732 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
615733 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
615734 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
615735 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
615736 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
615737 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
615738 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
615739 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
615740 was concerned by high levels of hiv infection in the country
615741 we are working with the ministry of the interior in dealing with uncontrolled immigration of zimbabwean women who are engaged in sexual activities in central mozambique
615742 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
615743 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy
615744 at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
615745 the choice is and was always between gb gordon brown running as the change candidate or as continuity nl new labor
615746 by trying to be change he played exactly the same game the media wanted but never the game that gives us the only chance of a 4th term in office
615747 the failed execution of this one program has now uncovered the fact there are broader problems systemwide that the state department must fix
615748 the city of long beach has a lot to do with it
615749 our success is a tribute to the city of long beach the city is rich with athletes and not just poly all of the schools have great athletics the citys schools are huge too many have around 4 000 to 5 000 students on campus
615750 long beach is the main reason it is a large city but it almost has a country setting everybody knows everybody
615751 its a great community and poly is such a community school generations of family go here in my family i went to poly my sister and my brother did and so did my kids too its like that with a lot of families im starting to see grandkids of people i went to school with going here
615752 once people graduate from poly they stay close to the program poly is coached by poly people and this emphasis on family gives us a real advantage
615753 its a mind set the spirit of being a jackrabbit kids come here and know that the people here really want them to get to that next level
615754 id estimate that on an average year anywhere from 15 to 20 kids graduate with division i scholarships
615755 poly is about tradition it was the first high school in long beach
615756 it started back when people saw the success we were having and wanting to be part of that success
615757 i remember growing up and climbing the fence to watch the football games and track meets and knowing that someday i wanted to be a poly athlete
615758 we use tradition as motivation big time teams never want to be acknowledged as the team that didnt make the playoffs
615759 everybody talks about football but poly has one of the best academic programs in the country
615760 i take pride in all of the kids there are a lot of kids who leave with athletic scholarships but there are also a lot of kids who leave with academic scholarships
615761 we have good coaching staffs in all of the sports here and in the football program we especially try to emulate a college program
615762 i have players come back after their first season of college football and tell me that their college practices are no different than their practices at poly the difference between poly athletes and others is that when they go to college they become an impact player right away
615763 everybody wants to beat us everyone in our league is our rival
615764 it can be very tough when every team we play sees their game against us as their super bowl we get everyones best shot
615765 we have a football field but we cant use it right now so we are practicing on the baseball field
615766 i have over 200 kids out there varsity in left field junior varsity in center field and the freshmen in right field we could complain but we just make it work
615767 it would be nice to have really good facilities but the kids appreciate what we have its just that old fashioned poly attitude
615768 a coalition service member was killed and another wounded when their convoy struck an ied this morning in kabul
615769 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
615770 clearly theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
615771 it is what it is its obviously something that was my ultimate goal something i dreamed of but now that its here its time to take that next step
615772 obviously for it to be your offense your team you kind of have to its like anything you have to go out there and win a bunch of games and kind of make it yours until you do that you can only do so much in practice and preseason its getting there
615773 people have questions they come and ask me they dont go to their own people or their own coach once people start doing that its inching more and more to it being your offense its all about production
615774 the jets game we were running a two minute offense and we ended up scoring but we were running play action in the two minute drill
615775 that tells you how important larry johnson is to the offense
615776 coach mike shula was with chan in miami so we have a lot of the same concepts so im very comfortable with it im comfortable with the concepts as opposed to the past offense it was the same terminology as what we ran but its not the same offense
615777 we have keys and if we see them chances are we might still have the same play on but we might change the decoration or we might change it from one run to another run we have like four different ways to check it its about getting in a better play opposed to be kind of hard headed and saying that plays going to work and were going to run it no matter what its all about being cat and mouse with the defense
615778 brodies got a cannon he likes to throw that thing in there
615779 damons more of a touch guy so you get used to different speeds
615780 during the jets game last year me and brodie sometimes it wasnt working when i was open it wouldnt be where i like it and i think hes going to figure it out and im going to figure out where he likes it too its all about getting that experience together and well make sweet music when its all said and done
615781 you have to adjust and you have to read body language and you have to understand whats going on out there they have to work together quite a bit
615782 hes different thats what makes us so unique we have two different cultures he likes country music and i like rap so i wake him up to some rap music every once in a while
615783 seeing what he looks like seeing how his days going just to be around him every day we cant help but gel and its all for a good reason he knows what i except of him and i know what to expect from him from the moment we wake up in the morning
615784 i remember hearing that he was a real humble down to earth guy just like jamarcus russell they knew each other from being from alabama wed ask how is he and hed tell us just like me wed say he dont throw like you youre trying to break peoples fingers but hed say he was an all around good guy
615785 i want to see him in games especially in preseason games move the team down the field and score
615786 we need to score its not all on him weve got to protect him theyve got to catch it and weve got to run it but he needs to get some confidence from getting the team in the end zone thats the most important thing
615787 brodie is the quarterback and when he comes in the huddle he exudes an air about him that kind of calms things down
615788 thats exactly what you want you want a quarterback who comes in there and is confident in what theyre doing confident with the plays that are being called with the checks that are being made
615789 ive played for quarterbacks in the past and felt like i almost had to help them with things not with brodie he has a great pocket presence and a good demeanor in the huddle which will make us follow him the difference between a guy whos had success for many years and a guy whos just starting out is just time just because you havent done it yet doesnt mean you wont do it i think thats more of an issue with brodie
615790 weve bought the loan at enough of a discount that we can make special arrangements with the borrower
615791 work out not kick out approach in working with homeowners
615792 if you ask me what kind of image i want i want an image of a liberal
615793 all the time he tried to poison my mind on anwars character he claimed to know anwar inside out
615794 and i at the time was praying that lightning and thunder would strike so that he could end his dumb speech
615795 i joined umno because of anwar ibrahim and left umno because of anwar ibrahim
615796 lo siento se ora pero este perro ya no tiene remedio es mejor que deje de sufrir
615797 i predict stocks will rocket to 30 increases settle and finally creep their way up to 52 week highs
615798 im pleased to report that technological advances by segers zoumis inc have created a much higher degree of efficieny in operations this means big profits for most middle east e gaming development related companies and their subsidiaries
615799 output of middle east e gaming development related products will nearly double overhead will decrease by 1 3 and employee salaries will increase by 15
615800 our fingers are crossed that corporate execs will honor all current contracts and not fire anyone
615801 and if all contracts are solid were willing to negotiate with management at an appropriate time in the future to make sure our interests are being satisfied
615802 for the past five years there has been a noticable trade imbalance between the usa and other nations working within the middle east e gaming development market particularly in operations and human capital the recent advances however will help mend this rift and keep more dollars on shore i expect to see demand for labor increase in the long run with additional long run profits for strong middle east e gaming development usa companies that move forward
615803 to keep things fair for all parties were going to begin a general auction for our new products within 30 days anyone who wants in and we know that almost everyone does will have an opportunity to bid on the product first dibs go to the top 3 companies who will enjoy a 90 period free of competition from other middle east e gaming development entities once this period expires other companies can access our new technology and use it as they see fit
615804 the recent news in the middle east e gaming development industry means big things for us including the need to expand our physical building and operations well be able to hire an additional and much needed 100 new employees who will help push our efforts forward this is going to be great
615805 im getting calls from middle east e gaming development industry executives investors and general employees all asking about what is going on and if they can provide information for the news agency of course they want their names mentioned so that a little publicity is given to their particular middle east e gaming development company but it does save me from hunting these people down and taking interviews
615806 you hear a clock ticking somewhere 0 days tick tick tick
615807 estimates are for 15 cents a share starbucks will miss that
615808 of note many of the companys operating expenses are fixed in nature as a result the softness in u s revenues during the third quarter fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and u s segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales

615812 kriterien f r die aufnahme von features in off world
615813 ik heb 41 jaar bij de holland america line gezeten ben ook de hele wereld over gevaren vertelt wolvekamp
615814 maar die rotterdam tja die zit op een gegeven moment gewoon in je genen
615815 ik ben nog op de bahamas geweest daar lag de rotterdam al een paar jaar stil er was niet veel meer van over met een ploeg van de lijn hebben we er toen weer wat nieuw leven in geblazen
615816 later werd ik stoker en olieman ik ben als bemanningslid vier keer de wereld rondgereisd
615817 vergeet ook niet de lijn de contouren van het vaartuig red van het schip tegenwoordig zijn de nieuwe schepen van die grote bakken
615818 in de machinekamer werkten we met 144 man en dat deden we voor bijna 1200 passagiers
615819 die asbestsanering werd een fiasco wat me toen vooral opviel dat het ineens zo stil was aan boord ik wachtte s nachts op het moment dat we gingen varen
615820 er komt een nieuwe technische installatie en nieuw sanitair de machinekamer maakt straks deel uit van de museumroute
615821 alsof ik een museum in stapte d rotterdam h t vlaggenschip van nederland
615822 het was ook een stevig schip en het bestaat nog helaas ging het daarna voorbij een stoomtijdperk bleek helaas toch een aflopende zaak

615824 de estarem envolvido nos ataques contra membros do seu partido e de incitarem e financiarem os recentes atentados
615825 wij denken dat het kan al wordt de knoop pas vrijdagavond doorgehakt zei directeur hans elemans van de rotterdam gisteren
615826 daar komt het schip tussen half drie en negen uur langs dus tijd en ruimte genoeg om het allemaal goed te kunnen zien
615827 dat snappen we best je moet daar ook geen duizenden mensen hebben
615828 het schip is van aanzienlijke betekenis voor het pact op zuid in welk kader gemeente woningcorporaties en projectontwikkelaars vele miljarden investeren aldus de minister in haar antwoord
615829 you should re imagine yourself as the ceo of me inc who is curently at loan at
615830 er zijn blijkbaar binnen de gemeente een paar afspraken langs elkaar heen gegaan twee weken geleden kregen we in de gaten dat de red bull airrace ook het terrein wil gebruiken we hebben dus wel even wat te bespreken zegt kwartiermaker hans elemans van het stoomschip
615831 dat betekent dat we de tijd tussen aankomst en ingebruikname hard nodig hebben
615832 tja dat zit gewoon in je bloed als je uit rotterdam komt
615833 ja de vloot van de hal de lijn daar ging het om de muziek van het duo valt in de traditie van de in crooswijk ter wereld gekomen accordeonist en componist jaap valkhoff ook wel bekend als slome japie
615834 ik ben heel blij dat nu te doen zegt henk
615835 het zit diep in mijn hart net als in dat van elke echte rotterdammer
615836 in mijn jonge jaren heb ik veel met jaap valkhoff opgetreden vertelt henk
615837 na zijn overlijden hoorde ik jan een keer spelen en ik kreeg kippenvel
615838 vroeger was ik het jonge binkie nu is jan dat
615839 die schitterende liedjes van valkhoff leven gewoon bij de mensen in de rijnmond weet henk
615840 vorige week waren we in tilburg daar wilden ze die rotterdamse liedjes ook graag horen
615841 jan kan dat soundje van valkhoff precies pakken zegt henk
615842 dat heeft met zijn instrument te maken maar ook veel met gevoel
615843 when danielle was in grade 5 i wasnt sure shed progress this far i thought there would be too many obstacles
615844 i dont use the chair in the house i crawl around here
615845 its about a boy in a wheelchair who believes he can do the same things his friends can he doesnt give up and eventually with determination is able to walk again i believe if you work hard you can reach your goal
615846 needing something read to me so i can understand it
615847 i hope i can get a laptop to take notes
615848 my case of spina bifida is considered mild i can walk in a walker a bit and can get in and out of the wheelchair by myself ive been in one since grade 5 but that hasnt stopped me from doing what i want to do my big concern is displacing my hip so i have to be careful
615849 theres a group of us maybe six or seven that play once a week at the millennium centre in antigonish students from st francis xavier university practise with us
615850 i wheeled three kilometres to help raise money for a pool lift at the millennium centre at x and we got enough money to buy the lift
615851 he was with a date at the semi formal but spent more time talking with me

615853 no i have upper body strength to wheel this one id get lazy if i had a motorized one
615854 i think i want to work with computers but well see
615855 the possibilities for this new technology are huge for the first time users will be able to make low cost calls from any part of the world using a handset or other mobile device and will be able to seamlessly roam from one wireless hotspot area to another
615856 buna ziua numele este si doresc sa va prezint o idee de afacere de succes
615857 wijntaart en biersoep horlepijp en pogo er wordt gegeten en gedronken gelachen en geweend gezongen en gedanst
615858 zo hebben we een groter deel van het schip in exploitatie genomen legt elemans uit
615859 vergeet niet dat dit een a typische klus is bijna alle schepen van deze leeftijd zijn al lang gesloopt bovendien zijn de wetten en regels op het gebied van veiligheid veel strenger geworden
615860 de ene keer op het gebied van techniek dan weer interieur of staalwerk naast nederlanders en duitsers werken we nu ook met denen ieren italianen roemenen en oekra ners
615861 wie binnenkomt treft de sfeer aan uit 1958 maar vindt net zo goed moderne zaken als draadloos internet sprinklerinstallaties en grote televisie schermen
615862 het personeel aan boord zal in maritieme uniformen rondlopen dat schept toch een bepaalde sfeer zegt elemans die merkt dat rotterdam langzaam maar zeker begint warm te lopen voor de terugkeer van het schip
615863 eine st rkere rekrutierung der politischen elite in deutschland aus h heren sozialen schichten als fr her festgestellt
615864 mehr oder weniger den mund nicht richtig aufmacht oder nur zur h lfte aufmacht und ansonsten davon ausgeht sie kann an der politik sowieso nichts ndern
615865 it really helped me that it started raining because i was able to go in the locker room and talk to my coach
615866 it wasnt easy to talk to my coach because he was really mad
615867 jesolo una citt bellissima dove ho trovato gentilezza e accoglienza non pare neanche di essere in italia
615868 the jam format was great if you were in the zone and i was definitely in the zone
615869 i wanted to go for it but i just played it safe and ended up second
615870 i just learned it last week i was having nightmares about landing it but i nailed it so it was a home run
615871 not even sure what she does noticed she has a thing for links and she wanted me to hang with her for a while but i wasnt sure why i should
615872 that made me laugh like i didnt know how to walk around this place you know gimme another beer would you
615873 i could barely read it too hard on the eyes
615874 mist is usually a cold hot meeting up thing isnt it you guys have weird weather
615875 besides i dont see a drinking area cordoned off for us heh bet you the old fogeys inside are staring out the windows at us with that pinched look going on

615878 shes a member of this healthcare blogger code of ethics and all
615879 mmhm whyd she put that down here where we cant see it

615883 even though the year has been rocky hes got faith in me
615884 i played little league here not worrying about contracts and all that other stuff
615885 oh yeah that curveball that went off the tv screen and back in the zone
615886 i always wanted one of those but it isnt in my bag
615887 coming up in the as system tim hudson was the bulldog and then there was mark mulder
615888 i was at intensity level five a super mellow guy thats what i was out there tonight
615889 i want to go out there as many times as possible
615890 whats that word they use babying im not really in favor of that if you want to bench press 200 pounds it wont help to keep lifting 150 over and over
615891 the baby thing i dont like it because id love to pitch in every game if i could
615892 gelukkig nodigt het weer vandaag minder uit om te gaan zwemmen
615893 frankly i believe him to be a con man with sociopathic tendencies
615894 the facts as disclosed in his complaint prima facie make out a very sad case showing not only the grossest kind of deficiency in service but the conduct of airlines that has caused immense mental agony emotional suffering harassment and other injustices
615895 even after valid boarding card he was not allowed to travel under the misnomer of mistake which in reality was done to accommodate another passenger
615896 the complainant is at liberty to file private complaint before the court of competent jurisdiction as the documents were allegedly forged before they were filed in the court documents r 1 and r 2 appears to be forged prima facie
615897 our attitude towards other non congress and non bjp parties will be determined by their attitude to the bjp or the congress
615898 our aim is to prevent mayawati from going to the bjp camp
615899 the high precision missile can be launched from standard torpedo tubes from a depth of 35 to 40 metres
615900 but extensive new trials conducted in mid july were perfect
615901 its pretty easy to argue that this is the most prestigious competition of its kind in the world
615902 the reason is that the signature part of the prize is a 50 concert tour all around the united states canada and mexico
615903 a lot of other competitions are things you put on your resume and then move on but with this the exposure you get is something that can start a career
615904 i said if were going to do this lets invite a bunch of the people who ive met on my travels that have blown my mind
615905 its kind of a geek fest a star trek convention its a safe place for a lot of people
615906 the classical guitar landscape used to be much more fragmented than it is now
615907 when the foundation was started in 1974 there were maybe three or four schools in the country where you could get a degree in guitar performance now there are about 500 you can get them anywhere
615908 and having all these thriving guitar programs has created a whole generation of dedicated and interesting guitar professionals
615909 because unlike violinists we cant go take auditions for orchestra jobs
615910 but the twist with guitarists is that were more likely to cross over into other kinds of music pop jazz flamenco world music and so on and although the concerts at the convention are primarily classical the foundation does try to help those cross pollinations
615911 also because guitarists dont have as rich a history in the classical and romantic eras were probably more active in trying to cultivate new music guitarists tend to be very cutting edge in trying to figure out just what the life of our instrument is
615912 having the convention here is a real feather in our cap
615913 its a recognition of the importance of the city with people like david encouraging composition and sergio selecting this out of all the places he could have gone
615914 there may be more players in new york or los angeles but if you think of places where there is a lot of activity and a vibrant scene its san francisco
615915 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
615916 what kind of a fool would lend his teenage kid a 600 hp supercar

615919 i was just working the count and got it to 3 1 when he threw me a fastball inside which i had been waiting for all night and i turned on it
615920 it takes a market of tens of billions of dollars as solar is now for these guys to get excited
615921 they believe that they need to be in this business
615922 its fantastic to see heavyweights such as intel and applied materials getting into the solar marketplace
615923 this sector is so wide open still with enormous growth potential
615924 it is way way too early to call any winners
615925 its all about the amount of innovation dollars actually concentrated on solar that matters
615926 its not obvious who are going to be the global leaders of this or what even the value chain is going to look like
615927 we are getting frustrated because no one is caring about kids and that is what we are thinking about
615928 if we dont reach agreement then we wont take it off the ballot
615929 if this tax passes most of the residential development in north san jose wont happen
615930 certainly anytime you go to the ballot theres a risk but were pretty confident that well get the support
615931 no gestures no pointing do not interact with the north koreans
615932 the renewal of yor b spirit educationally culturally economically and politically
615933 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
615934 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
615935 deck the halls with boughs of holly fa la la la la im wearing a thong look at me im so jolly fa la la la la im wearing a thong donning all my gay apparell fa la la la la la la la la im in my undies like will ferrel fa la la la la im wearing a thong

615937 we are happy in proportion to the things we can do without
615938 you know the best thing all the bands know how to play their own instruments
615939 we have a guy who weve been working with whos a really good singer and a great guy i really hope hes the one
615940 not a metal album although each song has some pretty heavy parts
615941 you know the best thing all the bands know how to play their own instruments
615942 we have a guy who weve been working with whos a really good singer and a great guy i really hope hes the one
615943 not a metal album although each song has some pretty heavy parts
615944 you know the best thing all the bands know how to play their own instruments
615945 yeah there are a lot of younger bands that are leaning back towards rock and roll but you know the best thing all the bands know how to play their own instruments
615946 i always look forward to either sit around the house and do nothing or tour and do something im here in florida getting used to the humidity so that when i get onstage on the first night ill be somewhat prepared take the california heat we had last week temps topped the 100 degree mark and put it here then add 100 humidity everythings wet your poor guitar neck also the sound coming off your cabinets sounds different because the air is so thick
615947 thank you for spending two hours on the phone with my insurance company in order to correct the mistake my doctor made
615948 well damn you could have done this before i came in
615949 please dont get mad at your pharmacist for trying to wait on you while you are also having a cell phone conversation a polite person asks the caller to call back so that they can conduct their business uninterrupted
615950 please put out your cigarette in the drive through polite people dont puff their smoke in their pharmacists face
615951 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
615952 good weather has a great deal to do with the natural conditions but whether this can be maintained has a lot to do with our pollution control measures because they also have a lot to do with the improvement
615953 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
615954 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
615955 i am sure that come the 9th of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
615956 si el movil al final no lo quieres nada m s que para llamar y eso
615957 joder lo bien que me ir a ahora un pc con internet o algo con internet

615959 the time for catholics to start worrying is when there are no anti catholics
615960 it doesnt allow us to deal with the shadow side of our own faith
615961 but that didnt happen until the 1880s in the 1860s this neighborhood was split between the german and the irish
615962 like watching a 2 000 piece puzzle assembled before your eyes
615963 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everybody elses business or their personal lives its inappropriate
615964 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
615965 no one is more supportive of gay rights than i am
615966 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
615967 okay lang naman po yun basta maganda pa rin yung itsura namin at hindi naman yung parang malaswa maganda naman yung produkto na imo model namin if ever eh
615968 ganun po talaga pag nasa showbiz alam naman lahat ng kakilala ko na hindi ako yun eh kaya hindi ako bothered kahit anong sabihin ng iba basta yung mga kaibigan at pamilya ko naniniwala sa akin
615969 hindi mangyayari yun at kahit na may ganun sigurado akong hindi siya yun dahil hindi siya ganun na tao wala sa personalidad niya yung ganun
615970 if you believe in democracy you must believe in it unconditionally if you believe that men should be free then they should have the right of free association of free speech of free publication then no law should permit those democratic processes to be set at nought
615971 if we are to survive as a free democracy then we must be prepared in principle to concede to our enemies even those who do not subscribe to our views as much constitutional rights as you concede yourself
615972 anybody who decides to take me on needs to put on knuckle dusters if you think you can hurt me more than i can hurt you try there is no way you can govern a chinese society
615973 if i were in authority in singapore indefinitely without having to ask those who are governed whether they like what is being done then i would not have the slightest doubt that i could govern much more effectively in their interests
615974 youre talking about rwanda or bangladesh or cambodia or the philippines theyve got democracy according to freedom house but have you got a civilised life to lead people want economic development first and foremost the leaders may talk something else you take a poll of any people what is it they want the right to write an editorial as you like they want homes medicine jobs schools
615975 what are our priorities first the welfare the survival of the people then democratic norms and processes which from time to time we have to suspend
615976 there is nothing to forbid anybody from nailing his colours to the mast and indeed it is the safest way to do it
615977 the peoples association is a government organisation to promote government policies
615978 i make no apologies that the pap is the government and the government is the pap
615979 the ideas of individual supremacy and the right of free expression when carried to excess have not worked they have made it difficult to keep america society cohesive asia can see it is not working in america itself there is widespread crime and violence old people feel forgotten families are falling apart and the media attacks the integrity and character of your leaders with impunity drags down all those in authority and blames everyone but itself
615980 for singapore its test for its own democracy must be whether it fit and serve the interests of its people and conditions and not serve some abstract ideal that the western media thought it ought to conform to if in 10 years philippines taiwan and korea were better societies because they adopted the us model singapore would hurry to catch
615981 political reform need not go hand in hand with economic liberalisation i hold unconventional views about this i do not believe if you are a libertarian full of diverse opinions full of competing ideas in the market place full of sound and fury therefore you will succeed
615982 i think in singapore we stand a chance of making the one man one vote system work with amendments as we have done you know like grcs we need to make it work and i believe with pragmatic adjustments given these favourable conditions we can have more open debate
615983 one man one vote is a most difficult form of government results can be erratic
615984 im not intellectually convinced that one man one vote is the best we practise it because thats what the british bequeathed us
615985 there is nothing to prevent you from pushing your propaganda to push your programme out to the students or with the public at large and if you can carry the ground if you are right you win thats democracy
615986 if you are a troublemaker its our job to politically destroy you put it this way as long as jb jeyaratnam stands for what he stands for a thoroughly destructive force we will knock him everybody knows that in my bag i have a hatchet and a very sharp one you take me on i take my hatchet we meet in the cul de sac
615987 i feel sanguine enough to say that there has never been a better set of conditions for open democratic politics because there is no need for unified front politics
615988 if we had considered them serious political figures we would not have kept them politically alive for so long we could have bankrupt them earlier
615989 once in a while think centre says they want to go to the speakers corner and they want to plant 100 flowers there let the 100 flowers bloom its a signal speak your voice be heard
615990 i know some people want even greater freedom but where politics is concerned i prefer to ease up slowly rather than open up with a big bang when gorbachev opened up the soviet union with his glasnost the soviet union collapsed with a big bang we should therefore pump the air into the political balloon slowly i dont intend to change my name to goh ba chov
615991 i am encouraged also because i see more and more people write letters to the press and sign their real names thats a good sign a good tendency to run a democratic system you must have democratic impulses in the people there must be a cultural basis for that system its not just having a constitution and saying
615992 our people should feel free to express diverse views pursue unconventional ideas or simply be different
615993 they say people can think for themselves do you honestly believe that the chap who cant pass primary six knows the consequence of his choice when he answers a question viscerally on language culture and religion but we knew the consequences we would starve we would have race riots we would disintegrate
615994 if it is not totalitarian to arrest a man and detain him when you cannot charge him with any offence against any written law if that is not what we have always cried out against in fascist states then what is it
615995 we have to lock up people without trial whether they are communists whether they are language chauvinists whether they are religious extremists if you dont do that the country would be in ruins
615996 the same law applies to me nobody has sued me for libel because i do not defame my enemies
615997 most libels and i have taken about 30 actions take place at election time it has not stuck because i am prepared to go before a court stand in the witness box and face the most aggressive of lawyers who can cross examine me on my personal history
615998 the way to build a cohesive society is to ensure that every singaporean is treated equally and that the rich and powerful are not favoured over ordinary singaporeans mr goh chok tong emphasised last night
615999 if i tell singaporeans we are all equal regardless of race language religion culture
616000 the human being is an unequal creature that is a fact and we start off with the proposition all the great religions all the great movements all the great political ideology say let us make the human being as equal as possible in fact he is not equal never will be
616001 we must encourage those who earn less than 200 per month and cannot afford to nurture and educate many children never to have more than two we will regret the time lost if we do not now take the first tentative steps towards correcting a trend which can leave our society with a large number of the physically intellectually and culturally anaemic
616002 there are some flaws in the assumptions made for democracy it is assumed that all men and women are equal or should be equal hence one man one vote but is equality realistic if it is not to insist on equality must lead to regression
616003 repression can only go up to a point when it becomes too acute the instruments of repression namely the army and the police have been proved time and time again in history to have turned their guns on their masters
616004 if i have to shoot 200 000 students to save china from another 100 years of disorder so be it
616005 without the elected president and if there is a freak result within two or three years the army would have to come in and stop it
616006 i am often accused of interfering in the private lives of citizens yes if i did not had i not done that we wouldnt be here today and i say without the slightest remorse that we wouldnt be here we would not have made economic progress if we had not intervene on very personal matters who your neighbour is how you live the noise you make how you spit or what language you use we decide what is right never mind what people think
616007 every singaporean who owns a flat can double his value in todays terms within the next 15 to 20 years in other words in the next 20 years we can make everybody worth twice as much at least
616008 weve got to compete ourselves from now on with developed countries not with developing countries because we are going to compete in the developed country league
616009 earning money is not the sole objective of life or education a community of any quality should have a whole range of skills and interests they should paint write perform visit art galleries and enjoy world class concerts only then will they form a vibrant rounded interesting community
616010 in the next decade we need to think and act like revolutionaries we have to innovate not merely imitate we will succeed not be following the footsteps of the incumbent but by introducing new dimensions into play we need singaporeans who can lead the way in creating new wealth for our economy
616011 new singapore will be one of the worlds finest most liveable cities arts theatres museums music and sports will flourish singapore will be a lively and exciting place our city will not only have depth but also the richness of diversity but above all singapore will a home for singaporeans
616012 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
616013 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
616014 the new estimates highlight the need for expanded hiv prevention services and should serve as a wake up call that the us hiv aids epidemic is far from over
616015 is that israel does not acknowledge that it has nuclear weapons
616016 planning commitment and action toward multilateral nuclear disarmament by nuclear weapon states
616017 there is serious concern that the united states has taken this step with the intention to create a precedent and pave the way for israel to continue its clandestine weapons activities
616018 the decline in home prices while necessary to clear the inventories is building in expectations of more house price declines which is keeping potential buyers on the sidelines
616019 we hebben de ganse nacht gestreden en het dorp gered
616020 is opgehelderd op basis van duidelijke bewijzen en bevindingen die geen twijfel laten bestaan
616021 het werk van de separatistische terreurorganisatie met bloed aan de handen
616022 het is alsof je een kind verbiedt een partijtje voetbal te spelen
616023 in het verslag wordt nergens vermeld hoe hoog de concentratie van die giftige stof precies was tal van vragen blijven onbeantwoord
616024 sta me dus toe dat nogal vreemd te vinden als de tegenexpertise negatief blijkt stappen we naar de rechter
616025 we gaan na of de redelijke termijn niet is overschreden
616026 dit is een heel complex onderzoek daar gaat dus wel wat tijd over
616027 ik weet dat ik op de 200 vrij normaal gesproken alleen michael phelps voor me hoef te dulden maar ook die is niet onverslaanbaar de 100 vrij is echter een afstand waar ik bezeten van ben om mijn ultieme droom op dat nummer na te jagen moet alles wijken zelfs een medaille die me op een ander nummer niet lijkt te kunnen ontgaan
616028 volver a a hacer todas y cada una de las cosas que hice
616029 bahwa gak ada yang gak mungkin kalo kita mau belajar
616030 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
616031 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
616032 the referendum defeat has launched ireland down the slippery slope of a retreat from involvement in europe and a return to the status of a being a client state of britain a second rejection of lisbon would inevitably doom the country to that fate for generations to come
616033 the only way is for the d il to ratify the lisbon treaty while simultaneously opting out of areas such as the charter of fundamental rights which probably does require referendum approval and the new defence arrangements whose misrepresentation prompted so many women to vote no
616034 bigger does not necessarily mean better and though the new film has some good things it does not have enough of them to make the third time the charm
616035 despite some 1 000 visual effects shots and more skeletons than a ride at disneyland this latest
616036 and the opposition openly declare they want abdullah to go on leading simply because he is weak a kind of backhanded compliment to become strong he might want to embrace pas as a coalition partner then he would have his two third majority
616037 to do this he will have to offer his sweeteners his usual solution to all problems maybe he would offer a second deputy prime minister to pas president datuk seri abdul hadi awang and ministership to some other pas leaders
616038 by associating with datuk seri abdullah accepting the sweets and soft pedalling pass islamic state raison detre pas is likely to lose support
616039 bn has denied our rights thats why we support the opposition but even they dont move in the exact direction we want at the stroke of a pen pakatan led governments can give us fully aided tamil schools ideological coordinator w sambulingam said in his speech
616040 right now its only one here and one there tell us what the plan is and how it will be executed if you can allocate 130 hectares for pig farms in selangor i am sure something can be done for tamil schools
616041 we are not supporting pakatan rakyat to gain political positions but because they have promised a free society and we have faith in their promise
616042 we recognise that any government needs to be pressured and lobbied to give the people what they want and this can only be effective when society and media is free and oppressive laws are abolished
616043 dont forget that the idea of hindraf is for your rights
616044 tamil school headmasters have refused to meet with opposition figures and cited an education ministry order i personally had to leave a parent teacher association meeting in kulim before the headmaster would attend
616045 samys attempt to mediate for the release of the hindraf 5 is a direct contradiction to what he said prior to the elections when he supported the arrests
616046 as far as hindraf is concerned we have no faith in mics race based struggle and we dont take samy seriously we ourselves are an offshoot of police watch and we were formed to fill the void because no one was fighting for indians
616047 we are not against the yang di pertuan agong or the country we are simply against the government that denies us our rights so with merdeka coming soon we want to launch our own campaign
616048 convoqu la marcha contra de juana y me llamaron fascista hoy el gobierno rectifica
616049 seguir n los obispos la l nea de oposici n radical al gobierno
616050 ser n mero uno es un regalo por tanto trabajo realizado en el pasado

616052 seguir n los obispos la l nea de oposici n radical al gobierno
616053 como dijo alfonso xiii yo me puedo saltar el protocolo porque lo tengo
616054 no nos gusta que de juana est en la calle nos repugna
616055 siempre he pensado que iniciar 800 000 casas al a o no era sostenible no se pod an prohibir ciertas cosas
616056 debemos decir a los bancos que no den m s dinero para financiar
616057 pens bamos que la ca da ser a m s suave
616058 no estamos hablando de dar dinero a tal o cual empresa sino de facilitar el acceso a la vivienda protegida
616059 hemos intentado ser siempre transparentes en funci n de los datos de cada momento

616063 deber amos empezar a ver una ca da de la inflaci n que a fin de a o deber a estar en el entorno del 4 por ciento o incluso por debajo
616064 llegamos a un desempleo del 24 por ciento con un d ficit p blico equivalente al 7 por ciento del pib
616065 the gnu coding standards were written by richard stallman and other gnu project volunteers
616066 the heads of state or governments stressed the urgent need to develop the regional hydro potential grid connectivity and gas pipelines
616067 a coalition service member was killed and another wounded when their convoy struck an ied this morning in kabul
616068 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
616069 clearly theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
616070 they were returning from the summit when an avalanche at the bottleneck hit them
616071 our liaison officer at the base camp confirmed death of five
616072 i talked to mr bossi and the fed is going in a global direction there will be some expansion into other countries with more international teams records of other nations will be held as well the federation is no longer going to be an american federation but a world federation the old logo is the american logo this federation is growing this is only the first step
616073 ik weet dat ik op de 200 vrij normaal gesproken alleen michael phelps voor me hoef te dulden maar ook die is niet onverslaanbaar de 100 vrij is echter een afstand waar ik bezeten van ben om mijn ultieme droom op dat nummer na te jagen moet alles wijken zelfs een medaille die me op een ander nummer niet lijkt te kunnen ontgaan
616074 het is alsof je een kind verbiedt een partijtje voetbal te spelen
616075 we hebben de ganse nacht gestreden en het dorp gered

616077 in het verslag wordt nergens vermeld hoe hoog de concentratie van die giftige stof precies was tal van vragen blijven onbeantwoord
616078 sta me dus toe dat nogal vreemd te vinden als de tegenexpertise negatief blijkt stappen we naar de rechter

616083 der handel brauchte einen kleinen schubser diesen hat der start der rebajas nun gegeben

616090 cest une enqu te tr s complexe cela prendra donc du temps
616091 like a dog chasing a car wouldnt know what to do with it if i finally caught it
616092 dan sama seperti manusia ditetapkan untuk mati hanya satu kali saja dan sesudah itu dihakimi
616093 tidak ada yang benar seorangpun tidak tidak seorangpun yang berakal budi tidak ada seorangpun yang mencari tuhan semua orang telah melanggar mereka semua tidak berguna tidak ada yang berbuat baik seorangpun tidak karena semua orang telah berbuat dosa dan telah kehilangan kemuliaan tuhan
616094 karena di dalam dia lah telah diciptakan segala sesuatu yang ada di sorga dan yang ada di bumi yang kelihatan dan yang tidak kelihatan baik singgasana maupun kerajaan baik pemerintah maupun penguasa segala sesuatu diciptakan oleh dia dan untuk dia
616095 apakah yang menghalangimu untuk bersujud menghormat kepada adam di waktu aku menyuruhmu
616096 saya lebih baik daripadanya engkau ciptakan saya dari api sedang dia engkau ciptakan dari tanah
616097 karena engkau telah menghukum saya tersesat saya benar benar akan menghalang halangi mereka dari jalan engkau yang lurus
616098 kepada setiap orang yang mendengar firman tentang kerajaan sorga tetapi tidak mengertinya datanglah si jahat dan merampas yang ditaburkan dalam hati orang itu
616099 orang yang tidak percaya yang pikirannya telah dibutakan oleh ilah zaman ini setan sehingga mereka tidak melihat cahaya injil tentang kemuliaan tuhan yesus
616100 tentulah allah berfirman semua pohon dalam taman ini boleh kau makan buahnya bukan
616101 semua pohon dalam taman ini boleh kau makan buahnya dengan bebas tetapi pohon pengetahuan yang baik dan yang jahat itu janganlah kau makan buahnya
616102 percayalah percayalah tidak usah berpikir cukuplah kamu percaya maka kamu akan selamat
616103 waspadalah supaya jangan ada orang yang menyesatkan kamu sebab banyak orang akan datang dengan memakai namaku dan berkata akulah mesias dan mereka akan menyesatkan banyak orang
616104 dan kamu akan mengetahui kebenaran dan kebenaran itu akan memerdekakan kamu
616105 tetapi sekalipun kami atau seorang malaikat dari surga yang memberitakan kepada kamu suatu injil yang berbeda dengan injil yang telah kami beritakan kepadamu terkutuklah dia kutuk dari tuhan
616106 semua pohon dalam taman ini boleh kau makan buahnya dengan bebas tetapi pohon pengetahuan tentang yang baik dan yang jahat itu janganlah kau makan buahnya sebab pada hari engkau memakannya pastilah engkau mati
616107 tentulah tuhan berfirman semua pohon dalam taman ini jangan kamu makan buahnya bukan
616108 buah pohon yang ada di dalam taman ini boleh kami makan tetapi tentang buah pohon yang ada di tengah tengah taman tuhan berfirman jangan kamu makan ataupun menyentuh buah itu nanti kamu mati
616109 sekali kali kamu tidak akan mati tetapi tuhan mengetahui bahwa pada waktu kamu makan mata kamu akan terbuka dan kamu akan menjadi seperti tuhan tahu tentang yang baik dan jahat
616110 hai adam diamilah oleh kamu dan isterimu surga ini dan makanlah makanan makanannya yang banyak lagi baik di mana saja yang kamu sukai dan janganlah kamu dekati pohon ini yang menyebabkan kamu termasuk orang orang yang zalim
616111 turunlah kamu sebagian kamu menjadi musuh bagi yang lain dan bagi kamu ada tempat kediaman di bumi dan kesenangan hidup sampai waktu yang ditentukan
616112 karena engkau berbuat demikian terkutuklah engkau diantara segala ternak dan diantara segala binatang dengan perutmulah engkau akan menjalar dan debu tanahlah akan kau makan seumur hidupmu
616113 aku akan mengadakan permusuhan antara engkau iblis dengan perempuan ini hawa antara keturunanmu dengan keturunannya keturunannya juru selamat yang akan datang akan meremukkan kepalamu dan engkau akan meremukkan tumitnya
616114 apakah sebabnya engkau bertanya kepadaku tentang apa yang baik hanya satu yang baik tetapi jikalau engkau ingin masuk ke dalam hidup turutilah segala perintah allah
616115 hai anakku sesungguhnya aku melihat dalam mimpi bahwa aku menyembelihmu maka fikirkanlah apa pendapatmu
616116 hai bapakku kerjakanlah apa yang diperintahkan kepadamu insya allah kamu akan mendapatiku termasuk orang orang yang sabar
616117 ambillah anakmu yang tunggal itu dalam versi lain anak sulung yang engkau kasihi yakni ishak pergilah ke tanah moria dan persembahkanlah dia di sana sebagai korban bakaran pada salah satu gunung yang akan kukatakan kepadamu
616118 celakalah kalian wahai orang orang yahudi sesungguhnya semalam aku melihat bintang ahmad telah terbit
616119 sebab pada awal dunia tuhan menjadikan mereka laki laki dan perempuan
616120 maka tuhan menciptakan manusia itu menurut gambar nya menurut gambar tuhan diciptakan nya dia itulah hari keenam
616121 kemudian tuhan allah mengambil sedikit tanah membentuknya menjadi seorang manusia lalu menghembuskan nafas yang memberikan hidup ke dalam lobang hidungnya
616122 mengapa engkau hendak menjadikan khalifah di bumi itu orang yang akan membuat kerusakan padanya dan menumpahkan darah padahal kami senantiasa bertasbih dengan memuji engkau dan menyucikan engkau
616123 raja mengirim jawaban ini sambutan surat yang kamu kirim kepada kami telah dibaca dan diterjemahkan
616124 suara dari darah darah saudaramu menangis kepada ku dari tanah
616125 philistines yang membalaskan dendam aku akan menyelesaikan balas dendam besar pada mereka
616126 ketahui olehmu bahwa ushul agama itu adalah mengenal yang disembah sebelum menyembah nya dan itulah haqiqat makna syahadat
616127 mengapa kaukatakan aku baik tak seorang pun yang baik selain dari pada allah saja
616128 malaikat menjawab roh kudus akan datang atas kamu dan kuasa yang maha tinggi akan menaungi kamu
616129 lihat aku mengangkat engkau sebagai allah bagi firaun dan harun abangmu akan menjadi nabimu kel 7 1
616130 adalah seorang nabi yang berkuasa dalam pekerjaan dan perkataan di hadapan allah dan mereka menyalibkan dia tetapi kita telah berharap agar ia adalah yang akan menebus israel
616131 allah memberi kesaksian bahwasanya tidak ada tuhan yang berhak disembah melainkan dia yang menegakkan keadilan para malaikat dan orang orang yang berilmu juga menyatakan yang demikian itu tak ada tuhan yang berhak disembah melainkan dia yang maha perkasa lagi maha bijaksana
616132 agama islam bercorak rasionalitas artinya rasio akal budi memberi tekanan sungguh sungguh oleh sebab itu trinitas ditolak sebab tidak dapat dimengerti bahwa 3 adalah 1 dan bahwa 1 adalah 3 kita tentu insyaf bahwa trinitas memang tidak dapat dimengerti
616133 aku akan pergi kepada bapaku dan bapamu kepada allahku dan allahmu
616134 cawan ku memang akan kamu minum tetapi hal duduk di sebelah kanan ku atau di sebelah kiri ku aku tidak berhak memberikannya itu akan diberikan kepada orang orang bagi siapa bapa ku telah menyediakannya
616135 oleh firman tuhan langit dijadikan oleh nafas dari mulut nya segala tentara nya
616136 sebab dia berfirman maka semuanya jadi dia memberi perintah maka semuanya ada
616137 langit menceritakan kemuliaan tuhan dan cakrawala memberitakan pekerjaan tangan nya
616138 engkau harus menyembah tuhan dan hanya kepada dia sajalah engkau berbakti
616139 ya tuhan engkau layak menerima puji pujian dan hormat dan kuasa sebab engkau telah menciptakan segala sesuatu dan oleh karena kehendak mu semuanya itu ada dan diciptakan
616140 inilah aku ego eimi yang telah menciptakan segala sesuatu dari ketiadaan
616141 jikalau tuhan adalah bapamu kamu akan mengasihi aku sebab aku keluar dan datang dari tuhan
616142 aku berkata kepadamu sesungguhnya jika seorang tidak dilahirkan kembali ia tidak dapat melihat kerajaan allah
616143 aku berkata kepadamu sesungguhnya jika seseorang tidak dilahirkan dari air dan roh ia tidak dapat masuk dalam kerajaan allah
616144 apakah sebabnya engkau bertanya kepadaku tentang apa yang baik hanya satu yang baik tetapi jikalau engkau ingin masuk ke dalam hidup turutilah segala perintah allah
616145 bukan dari darah atau dari daging bukan pula secara jasmani oleh keinginan seorang laki laki melainkan dari tuhan
616146 sebab karena kasih karunia kamu diselamatkan oleh iman itu bukan hasil usahamu tetapi pemberian tuhan itu bukan hasil pekerjaanmu jangan ada orang yang memegahkan diri
616147 setiap anak dilahirkan dalam keadaan fitrah yaitu suci bersih kedua orangtuanyalah yang membuatnya menjadi yahudi nasrani atau majusi
616148 bagaimana kami akan berbicara dengan anak kecil yang masih dalam ayunan
616149 sesungguhnya aku ini hamba allah dia memberiku al kitab dan dia menjadikan aku seorang nabi
616150 hai isa putra maryam ingatlah ni mat ku kepadamu dan kepada ibumu di waktu aku menguatkan kamu dengan ruhul qudus
616151 para nabi adalah saudara saudara sebapa tidak ada seorang nabi yang diutus antara aku dan putera maryam
616152 demi zat yang jiwaku berada di tangan nya putra maryam benar benar akan segera turun ke tengah tengah kamu sebagai hakim yang adil dia akan menghancurkan salib akan membunuh babi dan akan menghapuskan jizyah harta saat itu akan melimpah sehingga tidak ada seorang pun yang akan menerimanya sehingga sujud satu kali saja kala itu jauh lebih baik dari dunia dan isinya
616153 aku berkata kepadamu sesungguhnya jika seseorang tidak dilahirkan dari air dan roh ia tidak dapat masuk dalam kerajaan allah
616154 siapa yang mengikatkan dirinya pada tuhan menjadi satu roh dengan dia
616155 hai bani israil sesungguhnya aku adalah utusan allah kepadamu membenarkan kitab yang turun sebelumku yaitu taurat dan memberi kabar gembira dengan datangnya seorang rasul yang akan datang sesudahku yang namanya ahmad muhammad
616156 aku hanya diutus kepada domba domba yang hilang dari umat israel
616157 kami beriman kepada allah dan apa yang diturunkan kepada kami dan apa yang diturunkan kepada ibrahim ismail ishaq ya qub dan anak cucunya dan apa yang diberikan kepada musa dan isa serta apa yang diberikan kepada nabi nabi dari tuhannya kami tidak membeda bedakan seorangpun di antara mereka dan kami hanya tunduk patuh kepada nya
616158 kami tidak membeda bedakan antara seseorangpun dengan yang lain dari rasul rasul nya
616159 ampunilah kami ya tuhan kami dan kepada engkaulah tempat kembali
616160 aku akan meminta kepada bapa dan ia akan memberikan kepadamu seorang penolong yang lain supaya ia menyertai kamu
616161 aku tidak akan meninggalkan kamu dalam keadaan tidak tenang aku akan datang kepadamu
616162 aku akan pergi tetapi aku akan kembali dan tinggal di dalam kamu melalui roh kudus
616163 pada waktu itulah kamu akan tahu bahwa aku di dalam bapa ku dan kamu di dalam aku dan aku di dalam kamu
616164 dengan membangkitkan dia yesus dari antara orang mati dan mendudukkan dia di sebelah kanan nya di surga jauh lebih tinggi dari segala pemerintah dan penguasa dan kekuasaan dan kerajaan dan tiap tiap nama yang dapat disebut bukan hanya di dunia ini saja melainkan juga di dunia yang akan datang
616165 dan aku akan menggoncangkan semua bangsa dan himada untuk semua bangsa ini akan datang dan aku akan mengisi rumah ini dengan kemegahan kata tuhan pemilik rumah rabbul bait
616166 maka tatkala rasul itu datang kepada mereka dengan membawa bukti bukti yang nyata mereka berkata
616167 mu jizat mu jizat yang dikerjakan allah dengan tangan tanganku menunjukkan bahwa aku berbicara yang dikehendaki allah sungguh tidak pula aku berbuat menjadikan diriku menganggap seperti dia messiah yang kamu bicarakan karena aku tidak pantas untuk melepaskan ikat kaus kaki atau kancing sepatu pesuruh allah itu yang kamu panggil messiah yang telah diciptakan sebelum aku dan akan datang setelah aku dan akan membawa kata kata kebenaran sehingga agamanya tiada akan berkesudahan
616168 bagiku hidup itu adalah memiliki kehidupan kristus di dalam aku
616169 tuhan yang dalam kristus telah mengaruniakan kepada kita segala berkat rohani di dalam surga sebab di dalam dia tuhan telah memilih kita sebelum dunia dijadikan
616170 karena kita ini buatan tuhan diciptakan di dalam yesus kristus untuk melakukan pekerjaan yang baik yang dipersiapkan tuhan sebelumnya ia mau supaya kita hidup di dalam nya
616171 jadi siapa yang ada di dalam kristus ia adalah ciptaan baru yang lama sudah berlalu sesungguhnya yang baru sudah datang
616172 dan kita ada di dalam yang benar di dalam anak nya yesus kristus
616173 di dalam dia kita telah memiliki penebusan kita yaitu pengampunan dosa
616174 demikianlah sekarang tidak ada penghukuman bagi mereka yang ada di dalam kristus yesus
616175 di dalam dia kita memiliki penebusan kita yaitu pengampunan dosa
616176 dia kristus yang tidak mengenal dosa telah dibuat nya tuhan menjadi dosa karena kita supaya di dalam dia kita dibenarkan dalam tuhan
616177 lebih lebih karena kita sekarang telah dibenarkan oleh darahnya kita pasti akan diselamatkan dari murka allah roma 5 9
616178 dan semuanya ini dari allah yang dengan perantaraan kristus telah mendamaikan kita dengan diri nya
616179 dan oleh dialah ia memperdamaikan segala sesuatu dengan diri nya juga kamu yang dahulu hidup jauh dari allah dan memusuhi nya dalam hati dan pikiran seperti yang nyata dari perbuatanmu yang jahat sekarang diperdamaikan nya di dalam tubuh jasmani kristus oleh kematian nya
616180 kepada jemaat allah di korintus yaitu mereka yang dikuduskan dalam kristus yesus dan yang dipanggil menjadi orang orang kudus
616181 di dalam dia kamu juga ketika kamu percaya dimeteraikan dengan roh kudus yang dijanjikan nya itu
616182 sebab dalam dialah berdiam secara jasmaniah seluruh kepenuhan ke tuhanan dan kamu telah dipenuhi di dalam dia
616183 apakah sebabnya engkau bertanya kepadaku tentang apa yang baik hanya satu yang baik tetapi jikalau engkau ingin masuk ke dalam hidup turutilah segala perintah allah
616184 barangsiapa yang mengucap dua kalimah syahadat yaitu aku bersaksi bahwa tiada ilah yang benar kecuali allah dan aku bersaksi bahwa nabi muhammad adalah hamba nya dan utusan nya dan bersaksi bahwa nabi isa adalah hamba allah anak hambanya dan kalimah allah yaitu nabi isa as dijadikan oleh allah tidak berbapa hanya dengan kalimah kun yang berarti jadilah engkau maka jadilah dia yang disampaikan kepada maryam dan juga tiupan roh daripada nya serta bersaksi bahwa balasan syurga adalah pasti begitu juga balasan neraka adalah pasti maka allah akan memasukkan mereka yang dikehendaki ke dalam syurga melalui salah satu dari delapan pintu syurga sebagaimana yang dikehendakinya
616185 apakah sebabnya engkau bertanya kepadaku tentang apa yang baik hanya satu yang baik tetapi jikalau engkau ingin masuk ke dalam hidup turutilah segala perintah allah
616186 jika kamu benar benar mencintai allah ikutilah aku niscaya allah mengasihi dan mengampuni dosa dosamu
616187 sesungguhnya allah tuhanku dan tuhanmu karena itu sembahlah dia inilah jalan yang lurus
616188 sesungguhnya aku telah ditunjuki oleh tuhanku kepada jalan yang lurus agama yang benar agama ibrahim yang lurus dan ibrahim itu bukanlah termasuk orang orang yang musyrik
616189 apakah sebabnya engkau bertanya kepadaku tentang apa yang baik hanya satu yang baik tetapi jikalau engkau ingin masuk ke dalam hidup turutilah segala perintah allah
616190 tidak sempurna iman seseorang itu sebelum dia mengasihi saudaranya sebagaimana dia kasihkan dirinya sendiri
616191 seorang penzina tidak akan berzina jika ketika itu dia berada di dalam keimanan seorang pencuri tidak akan mencuri jika ketika itu dia berada di dalam keimanan yaitu iman yang sempurna begitu juga seorang peminum arak tidak akan meminum arak jika ketika itu dia berada di dalam keimanan
616192 sebab oleh karena satu korban saja ia telah menyempurnakan untuk selama lamanya mereka yang ia kuduskan mereka yang berada di dalam kristus
616193 jika kita mengatakan bahwa kita tidak berdosa maka kita menipu diri kita sendiri dan kebenaran tidak ada di dalam kita
616194 tetapi hendaklah kamu menjadi kudus di dalam seluruh hidupmu sama seperti dia yang kudus yang telah memanggil kamu
616195 kamu telah menerima kristus yesus tuhan kita karena itu hendaklah hidupmu tetap dalam dia
616196 bersihkanlah rumah ku untuk orang orang yang thawaf yang i tikaaf yang
616197 ini adalah waktunya kita menunaikan shalat shubuh the pray of the dawn
616198 sebab keinginan daging berlawanan dengan keinginan roh dan keinginan roh berlawanan dengan keinginan daging karena keduanya bertentangan
616199 janganlah engkau minum anggur atau minuman keras engkau serta anak anakmu bila kamu masuk ke dalam kemah pertemuan supaya jangan kamu mati berdosa itulah suatu ketetapan turun temurun imamat 10 8 9
616200 berbicaralah kepada orang israel dan katakan kepada mereka apabila aurat seorang laki laki mengeluarkan lelehan maka najislah ia karena lelehannya itu
616201 hai ahli kitab janganlah kamu berlebih lebihan melampaui batas dengan cara tidak benar dalam agamamu dan janganlah kamu mengikuti hawa nafsu orang orang yang telah sesat dahulunya sebelum kedatangan muhammad dan mereka telah menyesatkan kebanyakan manusia dan mereka tersesat dari jalan yang lurus
616202 tuhan yang menguasai timur dan barat dan apa yang ada di antara keduanya itulah tuhanmu jika kamu mempergunakan akal
616203 sebab dari dalam dari hati orang timbul segala pikiran jahat percabulan pencurian pembunuhan perzinahan keserakahan kejahatan kelicikan hawa nafsu iri hati hujat kesombongan kebebalan semua hal hal jahat ini timbul dari dalam dan menajiskan orang
616204 karena kita tahu bahwa manusia lama kita telah turut disalibkan bersama kristus supaya tubuh dosa kita hilang kuasanya agar jangan kita menghambakan diri lagi kepada dosa
616205 jadi saudara saudara kita adalah orang berhutang tetapi bukan kepada daging supaya hidup menurut daging
616206 sebab itu hendaklah dosa jangan berkuasa lagi di dalam tubuhmu yang fana supaya kamu jangan lagi menuruti keinginannya
616207 sesungguhnya kami telah membunuh al masih isa putra maryam rasul allah
616208 dan karena kamu adalah anak maka tuhan telah menyuruh roh anak nya ke dalam hati kita
616209 roh tuhan yang tinggal di dalam saya adalah pribadi yang hidup ia adalah tuhan yang diam di dalam hati saya
616210 aku akan minta kepada bapa dan ia akan memberikan kepadamu seorang penolong yang lain supaya ia menyertai kamu yaitu roh kebenaran
616211 ananias bagaimana bisa bahwa setan menguasai hatimu sehingga kamu sudah berbohong kepada roh kudus dan sudah menahan untuk dirimu sebagian dari uang yang kamu terima dari penjualan tanah itu 4 bukankah kepunyaan kamu sebelum tanah itu dijual dan setelah dijual bukankah uangnya boleh kamu gunakan apa yang membuat kamu berpikir untuk melakukan hal seperti itu kamu bukan berbohong kepada manusia tetapi kepada allah
616212 roh digunakan untuk allah itu sendiri atau pikiran ketuhanan energi nya pengaruh mengaruniai
616213 malaikat menjawab roh kudus akan datang atas kamu dan kuasa yang maha tinggi akan menaungi kamu
616214 yesus adalah seorang nabi yang berkuasa dalam pekerjaan dan perkataan di hadapan allah dan mereka menyalibkan dia tetapi kita telah berharap agar ia adalah yang akan menebus israel
616215 jadi sama seperti ketidaktaatan satu orang semua orang telah menjadi orang yang berdosa demikianlah pula oleh ketaatan satu orang semua orang menjadi benar
616216 manusia pertama berasal dari debu tanah dan bersifat jasmani manusia kedua berasal dari surga
616217 aku lebih baik dibandingkan dengan apa yang engkau ciptakan dari tanah itu
616218 pada mulanya adalah firman firman itu bersama sama dengan allah dan firman itu adalah allah firman itu telah menjadi manusia dan diam di antara kita
616219 roh kudus akan turun atasmu dan kuasa tuhan yang maha tinggi akan menaungi engkau sebab itu anak yang engkau lahirkan itu akan disebut kudus anak tuhan
616220 yusuf anak daud janganlah engkau takut mengambil maria sebagai istrimu sebab anak yang ada di dalam kandungannya adalah dari roh kudus ia akan melahirkan anak laki laki dan engkau akan menamakan dia yesus karena dialah yang akan menyelamatkan umat nya dari dosa mereka
616221 kalau bukan karena kamu wahai muhammad tidaklah aku ciptakan segala sesuatu
616222 aku bersyukur padamu ya allah tuhanku bahwa engkau telah sudi menciptakan aku akan tetapi ceritakanlah kepadaku aku mohon kepada engkau apa maksud amanat dari kat kata ini muhammad adalah pesuruh allah sudah adakah di sana manusia manusia lain sebelum aku
616223 kamu akan bersyukur kembali wahai hambaku adam aku ceritakan kepadamu bahwa engkau adalah manusia pertama yang telah aku ciptakan dan dia yang telah engkau lihat adalah anakmu yang akan datang ke dalam dunia bertahun tahun dari sekarang dan akan menjadi pesuruhku karena dia aku telah menciptakan seluruh alam yang akan memberikan penerangan kepada dunia bila dia datang yang rohnya telah ditempatkan dalam suatu keindahan surga 60 000 tahun sebelum aku menciptakan sesuatu
616224 hai maryam sesungguhnya allah menggembirakan kamu dengan kelahiran seorang putra yang diciptakan dengan
616225 sesungguhnya allah menggembirakan kamu dengan kelahiran seorang putramu yahya yang membenarkan kalimat yang datang dari allah menjadi ikutan menahan diri dari hawa nafsu dan seorang nabi termasuk keturunan orang orang saleh
616226 saksikanlah bahwa kami adalah orang orang yang berserah diri kepada allah
616227 ya tuhanku betapa mungkin aku mempunyai anak padahal aku belum pernah disentuh oleh seorang laki laki pun
616228 pemikiran rencana atau tujuan tuhan yang terutama sekali dalam perang
616229 ketika ia menetapkan dasar dasar bumi aku kebijaksanaan adalah kesayangan di sisinya
616230 langit menceritakan kemuliaan tuhan dan cakrawala memberitakan pekerjaan tangan nya
616231 bukankah engkau telah melihat aku jika engkau telah melihat aku maka engkau telah melihat allah
616232 aku akan pergi kepada bapaku dan bapamu kepada allahku dan allahmu
616233 terpujilah engkau karena kedua anak tunggal itu telah kaukasihani berilah mereka ya tuhan belas kasihan dan perlindungan dan biarlah mereka meneruskan hidup mereka dengan senang dan belas kasihan
616234 maka firman itu telah menjadi manusia serta tinggal di antara kita dan kami sudah memandang kemuliaan nya seperti kemuliaan anak yang tunggal yang daripada bapa penuh dengan anugerah dan kebenaran
616235 apakah akan aku jadikan pelindung selain dari allah yang menjadikan langit dan bumi padahal dia memberi makan dan tidak diberi makan
616236 sesungguhnya aku diperintah supaya aku menjadi orang yang pertama sekali menyerah diri kepada allah dan jangan sekali kali kamu masuk golongan orang orang musyrik
616237 tiada sekutu bagi nya dan demikian itulah yang diperintahkan kepadaku dan aku adalah orang yang pertama tama menyerahkan diri kepada allah
616238 ya tuhanku nampakkanlah diri engkau kepadaku agar aku dapat melihat kepada engkau
616239 kamu sekali kali tidak sanggup melihat ku tapi lihatlah ke bukit itu maka jika ia tetap di tempatnya sebagai sediakala niscaya kamu dapat melihat ku
616240 maha suci engkau aku bertaubat kepada engkau dan aku orang yang pertama tama beriman
616241 jika benar tuhan yang mahapemurah mempunyai anak maka akulah orang yang mula mula memuliakan anak itu
616242 maka yesus di bawa oleh roh kudus ke padang gurun untuk dicobai oleh iblis
616243 dan sekalipun ia adalah anak ia telah belajar menjadi taat dari apa yang telah diderita nya
616244 ya bapa ku jikalau sekiranya mungkin biarlah cawan ini berlalu daripada ku
616245 tetapi janganlah seperti yang kukehendaki melainkan seperti yang engkau kehendaki
616246 aku telah mempermuliakan engkau di bumi dengan menyelesaikan pekerjaan yang engkau berikan kepadaku untuk melakukannya
616247 itu adalah katamu bukan kataku aku tidak pernah mengatakan bahwa aku adalah anak allah kamulah yang mengatakan bahwa aku ini anak allah seperti yang aku katakan kalian tidak akan percaya walau aku katakan yang sebenarnya yaitu bahwa anak manusia telah terangkat ke langit
616248 karena anak anak itu adalah anak anak dari darah dan daging maka ia juga menjadi sama dengan mereka dan mendapat bagian dalam keadaan mereka supaya oleh kematian nya ia memusnahkan yaitu iblis yang berkuasa atas maut supaya dengan demikian ia membebaskan mereka yang seumur hidupnya berada di dalam perhambaan oleh karena takut akan maut
616249 i dont think that prices will return to the record level nor will they fall below 100 per barrel

616269 it takes a market of tens of billions of dollars as solar is now for these guys to get excited
616270 they believe that they need to be in this business
616271 its fantastic to see heavyweights such as intel and applied materials getting into the solar marketplace
616272 this sector is so wide open still with enormous growth potential
616273 it is way way too early to call any winners
616274 its all about the amount of innovation dollars actually concentrated on solar that matters
616275 its not obvious who are going to be the global leaders of this or what even the value chain is going to look like
616276 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
616277 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
616278 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
616279 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
616280 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
616281 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase

616287 would you be interested in doing the interview strictly on africa its an area of great interest to my heart it gets such little coverage and i think we might actually reach some potential volunteers to help among the mercs readership
616288 i got my start because i learned english at the peace corps
616289 writing names in hindi on the reverse side is useless it should be rectified immediately also the names should be written in both languages in the drivers direction
616290 there are certain restrictions on the size so we have put the names only in english wherever we get space like in case of brick and mortar signs we have written the names in both the languages
616291 road signs and markings are important traffic control devices but if too many signs are used it may confuse the commuters we agree there is need for indication in hindi language too but perhaps they are not there to avoid clutter
616292 i have done everything i know how to do my dog still isnt behaving i am soooo frustrated ps its all his fault

616320 hij wou steeds minder uit gaan liever bleef hij vaak thuis om computer spelletjes te spelen

616332 it is equally clear that millions of dollars have been paid out in what are dishonest claims
616333 i am alive and well and unconcerned about the rumors of my death but if i were dead i would be the last to know
616334 alles aan wordt gedaan om de evacuatie van nederland zo veilig en geregeld mogelijk te laten verlopen

616362 we will take part in any negotiations and talk about any issue which consolidates our nuclear rights but iran will not give an inch on its nuclear rights mahmoud ahmadinejad noted he made the remarks in a meeting with syrian president bashar al assad in tehran on saturday
616363 given the iranian nuclear standoff syria attaches great importance to international treaties directly related to the issue as to international accords iran has the right to enrich uranium and to operate a nuclear plant like any other state
616364 despite efforts made by certain states to disrupt tehran damascus ties these relations will remain unshakable and permanent
616365 whats happening to oil it is down 20 from its peak will you buy now
616366 oils down due to speculative unwinding of long positions and a growth scare in developed countries which might result in lower demand for the scarce commodity
616367 so the skirmishes between israel and iran continue and the usual problems in iraq nigeria etc also continue with supplies remaining vulnerable to serious disruptions us stockpiles are down no new oil discoveries
616368 hows the mining industry doing any increase in the output in gold will the gold mines continue to face power disruptions from eskom

616370 what do higher crude oil prices do to the general price levels in the world
616371 of course higher crude oil prices fuel inflation since most of the demand for oil is inelastic
616372 yes in fact in the 1900s many countries in the world had gold standards gold was used as a medium of exchange
616373 paper currencies like us dollar tend to lose their purchasing power over the years why

616385 jangan kamu mengkhususkan malam jumaat dengan solat yang berbeza dengan malam malam yang lain jangan kamu mengkhususkan hari jumaat dengan puasa yang berbeza dengan hari hari yang lain kecuali ia dalam bilangan hari puasa yang seseorang kamu berpuasa riwayat muslim
616386 pada hadis ini larangan yang nyata mengkhususkan malam jumaat dengan sesuatu solat yang tiada dengan malam malam yang lain dan puasa pada siangnya seperti yang telah dinyatakan sepakat para ulama kemakruhannya para ulama berhujah dengan hadis ini mengenai kesalahan solat bidaah yang dinamakan solat al raghaib semoga allah memusnahkan pemalsu dan pereka solat ini ini kerana sesungguhnya ia adalah bidaah yang mungkar daripada jenis bidaah yang sesat dan jahil padanya kemungkaran yang nyata sesungguhnya sejumlah para ulama telah mengarang karangan yang berharga begitu banyak dalam memburukkan dan menghukum sesat orang menunaikan solat tersebut dan perekanya para ulama telah menyebut dalil dalil keburukan dan kebatilannya dan kesesatan pembuatnya
616387 ketahuilah olehmu semoga allah merahmatimu sesungguhnya membesarkan hari tersebut dan malamnya hari dan malam jumaat pertama rejab hanya perkara baru yang dibuat dalam islam selepas 400 tahun diriwayatkan mengenainya hadis yang palsu dengan sepakat ulama yang mengandungi kelebihan berpuasa pada siangnya dan bersolat pada malamnya mereka menamakan solat raghaib
616388 ketahuilah sesungguhnya solat yang bidaah ini menyanggahi kaedah kaedah islam dalam beberapa bentuk
616389 apakah bagi mereka sekutu sekutu yang membuat syariat mana mana bahagian dari agama mereka apa yang tidak diizinkan oleh allah
616390 sesiapa yang membuat perkara baru dalam urusan kami ini islam apa yang bukan daripadanya maka ianya tertolak
616391 wahai abu abd allah gelaran al imam malik dari mana aku patut berihram
616392 apakah lagi fitnah yang lebih besar daripada engkau melihat bahawa engkau telah mendahului satu kelebihan yang rasulullah saw yang telah menguranginya
616393 berhati hatilah mereka yang menyalahi perintahnya rasulullah saw jangan sampai menimpa mereka musibah atau menimpa mereka azab seksa yang pedih surah al nur ayat 63
616394 apakah ini patung patung ini yang kamu berdiri mengadapnya memujanya
616395 sesungguhnya kamu dan datuk nenek kamu dalam kesesatan yang nyata
616396 dan ketua ketua mereka menghasut dengan berkata jangan kamu meninggalkan penyembahan tuhan tuhan kamu terutama penyembahan wadd dan suwaa dan yaghuth dan yauuq serta nasr dan sesungguhnya ketua ketua itu telah menyesatkan kebanyakan dari umat manusia dan dengan yang demikian janganlah engkau wahai tuhanku menambahi orang orang yang zalim itu melainkan kesesatan jua
616397 sesiapa yang memulakan dalam islam sunnah yang baik lalu ia diamalkan selepas itu ditulis untuknya seperti pahala orang yang mengamalkannya ini tidak mengurangkan pahala mereka para pengamal itu sedikit pun sesiapa yang memulakan dalam islam sunnah yang jahat lalu ia diamalkan selepas itu ditulis untuknya seperti dosa orang yang mengamalkannya ini tidak mengurangkan dosa mereka para pengamal itu sedikit pun

616441 itd be nice to have a nice clean beach out there and no smell
616442 we read about this in the newspaper and wanted to bring the kids to see everything
616443 the officers were receiving premium pay but they werent being utilized
616444 part of the discussion ive heard among cities is does it make sense to spend that much money to maintain an entire team especially if you dont see many labs per year
616445 we have our own investigation arm so we can sort of be a clearinghouse for all calls
616446 its about whether it makes sense to expend our resources and training to have a nine to 10 person meth lab team or should we focus our resources on auto theft for example
616447 we no longer have enough meth cases to devote deputy prosecutors solely to them
616448 people are still consuming methamphetamine but instead of cooking it they are buying it
616449 were way ahead of where we were because weve had plenty of time to get sergeant joes teeth looked at and get them fixed
616450 we realized we had a dental problem so now we now take an active look at what the medical readiness of a soldier is during drill periods
616451 in the guard we mirror what the societal trends are
616452 weve got shortages of medical insurance shortages of dental insurance were no different than anybody else but weve had a plan in place and had it in place long enough it looks like well come out ahead
616453 there are always going to be some flaws or mishandlings of things because our officers dont handle labs that often
616454 i think its just safer for our members if we just go to the pierce county team its safer for our citizens and its safer for us
616455 similar to that which officers face when in their own garages
616456 i can be ready to make a martini and have ice and a stir stick and someone will hear a stirring noise
616457 but i will have nothing poured in except h20 and my martini still wouldnt be ready

616461 id love to play him hes one of my favourites and there are some things in the pipeline
616462 we wanted to break the format and do something different particularly after how powerful the climax was with the death of two major characters
616463 so were telling one big story in season 3 and putting the torchwood crew under a huge amount of pressure and just seeing how they cope with their numbers depleted
616464 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
616465 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
616466 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right
616467 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much
616468 but there is a tiny part of me that kind of prefers she does stay dead
616469 its a big show for bbc america and its a show they are really proud of and it works really well i dont exactly know what that means in physical numbers but it gets a lot of airtime and it gets a lot of coverage

616471 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage

616481 celebrate what a great day earth day has been 2008
616482 the earth healing initiative has been a great success this year
616483 congratulations earth healers youve done it it has been a success
616484 the epa great lakes 2008 earth day challenge has been a great success
616485 computers have been recycled pharmaceuticals have been brought together for proper disposal
616486 we are hearing reports from all over the midwest about wonderful things that are happening
616487 pharmacological waste more than a million pills and all kinds of poundage of equipment and computer materials that are surplus that will not pollute the beautiful great lakes over the next years because of the success of this challenge
616488 congratulations to those members of the faith communities and others who have been a part of this
616489 it has been a great day a great week a great earth day 2008
616490 what a great opportunity it has been to be part of the ecumenical work and interfaith work of assisting others to see the environmental concerns set before us
616491 everybody is an environmentalist because all of us want clean air to breathe all of us want clean drinking water we all enjoy the outdoors and nature
616492 so every single one of us no matter our political understandings are no matter where we are on the liberal and conservative line no matter what we think of any of the big issues facing the world today all of us can agree that it is in all of our interests
616493 is an honoring of the god that made us that we can be part of this movement to preserve to reuse to recycle to make a difference
616494 sometimes all kinds of political forces connect to that but yet all of us agree that we can all certainly conserve and save and bring back and then give to the next generation what has been given to us
616495 it is a sign of great significance that people can join hands and work together
616496 so celebrate it is a good day for the environment and it is a good day for all of us together
616497 people of goodwill throughout the upper midwest who have been a part of this work
616498 thanks to the environmental protection agency for their help and assistance in all of this work
616499 the epa great lakes 2008 earth day challenge has been a part of the lives and will be a part of the future of this whole area
616500 it is a wonderful opportunity to begin to look at what it is that we hold in common
616501 what we hold in common is this wonderful great lakes basin
616502 this is a wonderful place with lakes and streams and forests everywhere in the midwest and the great plains and the great fields
616503 we have been a part of saving some of this and making a difference thats what it is all about making a difference
616504 the faith communities do that each and every day in so many ways this is just one more way people of faith have bonded together and are working together to make a difference in the world
616505 when we are working together as different believing communities great things can happen
616506 sometimes we become so focused on what divides us what disconnects us what separates us and there are important things that sometimes do that but yet we can all have loyalty and allegiance to this world that has been our home and this part of the world that we have been blessed with by god
616507 god has given us the privilege of living here in the midst of these lakes and in the midst of all of this beautiful nature
616508 when people of faith whether they be of christian traditions or of other traditions gather together to work on what connects us one of those things that connects us is respect and awe for the creation that surrounds us
616509 we are part of a movement together in these early years of the twenty first 21st century to save what has been given to us by the generations before us and what god has provided to us
616510 when you can have people of all traditions working together wonderful things can happen people joining hands and making things happen a spectacular success was this initiative thanks be to god for that and thanks be to all the people that made this possible
616511 now in the springtime what a better time of year there is than spring i can not imagine springtime when the trees are just blossoming and the flowers are coming up and the spring rains to be reminded of what a great god we have who has provided all this to us
616512 so it is our privilege then to do this ministry to do this work together
616513 every day is earth day every day is an environmental concern day
616514 water is life and the quality of water determines the quality of life
616515 slotd was an absolutlely brilliant masterpiece of a performance except for the chick trying to be a dude

616517 since the beginning of time our people have relied upon the sturgeons for various reasons including for food and scraping hides
616518 in our legends the sturgeon are the protectors of our wild rice
616519 we have been engaging the students in the culture language science and the social studies of what the sturgeon mean to our people
616520 in the science department they have been studying the anatomy and the physiology of the sturgeon
616521 in the language arts department they are looking at the sturgeon habitats and what the effects of pollution are
616522 in social studies they are looking at the different migrations the geography the path the sturgeon used to take to come to their home here their traditional spawning grounds on the menoninee indian reservation
616523 because of two dams that are here now south of our reservation sturgeon are no longer able to come home here to their ancestral spawning grounds
616524 in the language and culture room i focus on the historic importance and the legends of the sturgeon and how these things were passed down from one generation to another generation and why its important for our youth to hang on to that
616525 to look forward into the future with the knowledge of the sturgeon but yet hang onto their spiritual and cultural heritage that is so rich
616526 we are so fortunate to have so many elders that we still work with that are able to give us this knowledge and pass it from one generation to the next despite all of the forced assimilation and the changes in our youth who are trying to make their way in modern society yet integrate the traditions with the technology in todays world awanahopay said
616527 the younger students put their hands in paint and made flower hand prints on the wall
616528 all week students have been cleaning up the reservation and one student was so inspired she wants to start an earth club
616529 the students are giving thanks to mother earth for all that she had done
616530 they are taking a moment each day to do that
616531 we know that mother earth can shake us off at any moment
616532 we are the ones that need her she doesnt need us
616533 one of premises of the class is to do things not just talk about what we are going to do and how the world is going to be changed but having students do things

616536 technical capabilities that could be applied to producing nuclear weapons if a decision is made to do so
616537 many of the sites are far from town centers and cities and are under the control of tribes
616538 a sumerian cylinder seal can be bought for less than 100 and gold coins for even less in baghdad
616539 however the same cylinder seal can be sold for more than 2 000 outside of iraq
616540 the destruction of iraqi antiquities after the 2003 war has been enormous
616541 we need a massive effort from the international community to return the stolen pieces and to help us to protect the remaining archaeological sites
616542 for us relief is only when our loved one is safe and sound standing freed before us i believe that my husband masood is held only three kilometres from my home yet he continues to suffer unknown ill treatment and we his wife his children and his very old parents cannot even see him they the new government must act now to bring them back immediately
616543 by holding people in secret detention the government of pakistan has not only violated their rights but also failed in its duty to charge and try those suspected of involvement in attacks on civilians

616557 theyve got different riding styles in motogp and the way you overtake in motogp is different to superbike
616558 when i was in superbikes we were all specialists in superbike racing so it was just as hard to win those races as these

616574 am wochenende gibt es keine weiteren ausk nfte zu dem fall
616575 theres an obligation on the environment agency to have to review these combined sewer overflows
616576 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now
616577 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
616578 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
616579 we have identified around 3 500 of these temporary consents but we operate on a risk basis and because most of these have not been identified as unsatisfactory and are low risk to water quality they are not a priority of ours
616580 there is not a white america and a black america and latino america and asian american america there is the united states of america

616582 the walls between races and tribes natives and immigrants christian and muslim and jew cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down
616583 weve made a lot of mistakes and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions
616584 die landschaft ist sehr sinnlich wer seine mitte finden m chte der ist hier richtig
616585 besondere anziehungskraft ben dabei frei stehende lastz ge von speditionen fuhrparks und baustellenfahrzeuge aus
616586 wir werden in zukunft verst rkt unsere aufmerksamkeit darauf richten
616587 i know our generation is going to make it through life with jobs and being financially stable val but i worry about the children
616588 you and i have made it growing up through the depression as children ourselves and as young adults through a world war our own parents certainly had cause to worry about us too
616589 our kids will survive adapt to their surroundings and thrive in love and life as much as fate permits
616590 its a great venue for players to be seen by college coaches and for young players to work and improve their games
616591 with the tough economic times were just trying to keep this thing moving
616592 the place has been a big part of peoples lives
616593 zumaya is a little tender in his arm its a little higher in the arm than the triceps flare up he had last sunday he saw the doctor last night and the doctor doesnt think its any issue but were going to take all precautions ill give him these next two games saturday and today off
616594 is throwing the ball extremely well but hes throwing too many pitches so youve got to back him off for a couple of days at a time
616595 its like ive always said when you have to fight through the pitching problems then you normally have problems
616596 we had to replace willis and bonderman we had to find guys to pick up the slack for rodney and zumaya and then when they get back you have to be very cautious with them youre fighting to survive
616597 if you start preparing for an opponent too early what happens is your starters dont play very much
616598 now youre losing that fundamental work that youre trying to get
616599 i dont think hes had a consistently good year the statistics show that
616600 hopefully hell go out there and pitch well for us over the next couple months
616601 pudge is a much more proven performer than farnsworth i know farnsworth has been on a roll but one week does not make a season
616602 the high strikeout total indicated my stuff was pretty good
616603 you have to be consistent in quality of pitches theres a very fine line between whats a good pitch and whats not a good pitch
616604 there were only a few times where i tried for strikeouts because there were men in scoring position where they could get a run with a ground ball
616605 it was the hand i was dealt today and it didnt work out
616606 i forced them to concentrate substitute its chaotic for them a guy goes down you have to substitute its tough on the coaches thats good thats great work for us
616607 ive taken the rhythm out of the team the way i do it
616608 the idea was to get the fundamental work and get every situation all the mechanics of a game thats what i was trying to accomplish today
616609 im going to have a better feel when we play somebody else really what i do like about them is their hustle theyre on the details theyre working really hard in those areas thats the part i like
616610 and we are just going to continue to make a physical investment in running it were just going to continue to do that
616611 das sind zwar echte oldtimer aber wir haben sie originalgetreu als polizeiwagen hergerichtet weil es sie mit der ausstattung in der sie einst im polizeidienst waren gar nicht mehr gibt
616612 he pushes us to the edge to the breaking point and beyond to see how we handle it
616613 i wish yall could videotape the things we go through with this man
616614 you try to make the drills so difficult that toward the end you really find out who the guys are who has that inner strength and toughness
616615 they can get nasty but thats ok because games can get nasty
616616 i want them going through the pain of commitment together i think thats important theyre earning the privilege of wearing that jersey
616617 well think were done for the day and hell have more for us
616618 i am always trying to challenge these guys how can i put these guys in some really severe adversity
616619 sometimes they think theyre done but theyre not done ill throw one little thing in there maybe two maybe three maybe 10
616620 by 23 or so youll find out who your guys are you see whos rolling their eyes and shaking their heads and whos still intense
616621 are we getting tougher are we more competitive are we pulling together

616639 this morning ive been back twice and its still closed
616640 police were inside it is a bit inconvenient when you have so much to do
616641 we contacted the police because we took the threat seriously
616642 the police asked staff to vacate the premises and the branch was re opened about 3 30pm to trade for the remainder of the afternoon
616643 there were 20 branch staff and 10 business banking staff evacuated
616644 i think its just another step in sending a clear message that smoking isnt an acceptable safe activity
616645 if the councils around us move to do it i would imagine going down the same path
616646 we congratulate these councils for taking real measures to protect the community against cancer causing tobacco fumes
616647 but as the vast majority of people in nsw support smoke free outdoor areas we urge the remaining councils to act upon their expectations

616658 i just thought of the cartoon so i made it
616659 regardless of what you think about guns the genesis of this guns bill comes from the minister for planning needing two votes to get his controversial planning laws through the parliament by 18 votes to 17
616660 why else would such a guns bill come through the parliament that relaxes gun laws in nsw
616661 putting this into a local context everyone who follows local issues knows the shooters party in our area likes to position itself as the great friend of council but as soon as a dirty little deal to relax gun laws could be done they sold local councils and any authority they had to determine development applications down the tube
616662 in my 12 years in state politics this is now the low point
616663 we are stuck in a regime which can best be summarised as by the vested interests and for the vested interests
616664 unfortunately public interest is struggling to get a look in at the moment and i hope we can make this change soon
616665 an announcement on the successful applicant is likely to be made within a couple of weeks
616666 when they called out my name to say id won my hands immediately started shaking
616667 it was pretty difficult but i managed to get it all finished in the end
616668 we wanted to build a site that would help promote domestic tourism and given the overwhelming response weve received in the first few weeks its safe to say that australians are well and truly behind this cause
616669 there are a lot of ideas out there that try to help the bride or the vendor but not both
616670 weddzilla is trying to make it mutually beneficial for everybody
616671 i think its really needed in the marketplace because i basically wait until the brides come to me
616672 this gives them the capability to be specific in what theyre looking for it gives us the capability to connect with brides
616673 when youre planning a wedding youre on a budget crunch youre on a time crunch and youre at the mercy of waiting to hear other people call you back you kinda feel like you want to be more in control of everything rather than being at the mercy of them
616674 you start to see where the term bridezilla comes from
616675 we didnt want future brides to go through the same painful process that they go through now vendors come to the brides instead of brides going to all the vendors
616676 and a bit of transparency which traditionally there has not been much of
616677 the thing with cold calling is you never know what youre going to get
616678 you want to be working with someone who gets what you want you want to know that this person gets you that they know what you like
616679 people are really champing at the bit to get this thing out there as fast as we can
616680 we really didnt talk about whether we were for the war or against it as we were face to face and side by side with each other instead we talked mainly about our states and the importance of working with washington d c and getting things done

616685 n o podemos ter virtudes p blicas e v cios privados isso t pico das hipocrisias
616686 estima se que haja cerca de 400 mil naturistas na europa e por isso se as autarquias nos pedirem um parecer n s diremos que sim desde que sejam praias oficializadas
616687 temos de vestir a roupa e ir a p pelo areal normalmente at nem nos importar amos de o fazer que os naturistas gostam de andar mas agora no ver o com o calor torna se muito complicado
616688 n s achamos bem que os outros tenham parques de estacionamento apoios de praia e tudo isso o que n s n o aceitamos ser tratados como portugueses de segunda

616702 mel oliver come in captain youre crossing the bottom of a ship coming at you
616703 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
616704 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
616705 repeating among republicans as well as democrats conservatives as well as liberals and across all races ages education levels and incomes
616706 the notion of blaming ones leader for the death of a family or community member from a terrorist attack or war might seem odd at first
616707 but a personal tie to a victim converts abstract distant costs of international violence into a vivid personal and profoundly emotional experience one that has clear strong and consistent political implications
616708 once it was believed that people who were affected in this way by 9 11 or the war in iraq were a small section of society but this pattern has more impact than people thought
616709 since those who are veterans or know someone serving are more likely to know someone harmed by war i think that a candidates military service likely mitigates the negative effect of a casualty
616710 that is those who are most likely to see military service as a positive aspect are also those most likely to know someone injured or killed as a result military service by a candidate linked to the war i e mccain probably decreases the negative effect
616711 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in awhile
616712 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
616713 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
616714 they spurs are a club with great tradition but since they are not a team playing in the champions league we spartak himself and his agent are more likely than not to reject their offer
616715 i love the premier league and i would certainly like to play there however if i go to england i would want to play for arsenal or chelsea
616716 tottenhams offer is not the only one we have received some spanish clubs have put down their interest and italy also has a top class league
616717 its been a success on the soccer side its moved forward weve gotten the interest in the league that weve wanted to which has brought success
616718 if you bring over someone you know is injured and make hoopla about it and try to get the non mls fan and all youve got is beckham injured you just lay an egg they deserve failing because they set themselves up to fail
616719 it was a smash and grab they wanted the money and season ticket sales and didnt take into consideration he was injured it was fraudulent and disingenuous to sell beckham ticket packages when he didnt play
616720 go and ask the average american sports fan about giving mls a chance this year and they say the mls overpromised and underdelivered
616721 a great honor and privilege a chance to show the world how far theyve come
616722 it will bring a lot of world leaders and dignitaries to beijing and they can see how it is today
616723 even people i work with other physicians still think china looks like what they see in the movies
616724 the olympics have become a disaster because they bulldozed peoples houses and created this fake boom
616725 maybe the olympics will bring china a good image to the world but these goddamn games have made people commit suicide
616726 i dont like to see the olympics used as an excuse for the chinese communist party to persecute people
616727 im concerned that the olympics are being used as a propaganda tool
616728 i dont think making a mockery of the country is the way to go
616729 if you just keep pounding the government theyll just tighten up their security
616730 the torch run protests just gave the government a darn good reason to do that
616731 im proud that china is doing everything it can to make the olympics the best they can be
616732 i think the whole world is very excited about it
616733 i think had there been a unified boycott that would have been the most powerful statement that could have been made
616734 the opposition wasnt just the white sports establishment but the black sports establishment as well
616735 the historically black schools made it clear that they saw nothing of value in what we were trying to achieve
616736 they were not going to admit to a problem much less endeavor to make changes
616737 when the revolt took place at san jose state we got so many inquiries
616738 it dawned on us that black athletes across the country were isolated alienated and exploited
616739 people began to say hey is this where were at in this country
616740 we understood that was going to be our greatest contribution to heighten the contradiction between what is professed and what is actual
616741 we knew what the mileage capability of the proposal was
616742 tommie and john felt that a statement needed to be made but i didnt know what they were going to do
616743 when they did it i thought that it was not just fitting but a phenomenal end to what had been an 18 month struggle
616744 i thought it was dignified i thought that dr king would have agreed with it i thought that it was sufficiently militant it became the signature protest in an era of protests
616745 i look at the distance we have come but also at the amount of work that remains to be done
616746 i say no i was just a product of my generation

616835 it was a long struggle but still i have no regret i have got the opportunity to represent my country in an olympics
616836 i knew if i join the peacekeeping mission i may be out of athletics forever
616837 the facts as disclosed in his complaint prima facie make out a very sad case showing not only the grossest kind of deficiency in service but the conduct of airlines that has caused immense mental agony emotional suffering harassment and other injustices

616842 shortly afterwards israeli defence minister ehud barak was contacted again by abbas who asked him to allow all of them to return to gaza
616843 those who are accused of breaking the law will be investigated and if they are found to be guilty will be brought to justice those who are proved innocent will be released
616844 confirms these people are breaking the law because they prefer to surrender themselves to the israeli occupation than to stay in their homes
616845 our position on principle is that we work with and aid those among the palestinians who struggle against radical islam who oppose terrorism and who favour negotiations

616847 devoted to empowering african americans to enter the economic and social mainstream
616848 eric had a dose equivalent to 190 years of background radiation
616849 johns was 107 the mods maximum safe dose was just 30
616850 hopefully this will mean they have to admit everything else
616851 there were 20 000 others there they and their families suffered just as badly
616852 in reality they have no idea who had how much dose eric and john had records taken but most had none those who had film badges for the explosions were made to hand them in and they were never labelled to show who was wearing them
616853 i think had there been a unified boycott that would have been the most powerful statement that could have been made

617095 this close season seems to have gone on for ages and been completely dull
617096 cristiano ronaldo will demand to be allowed to move to real madrid when he returns to old trafford on tuesday
617097 alternatively if lengthening the season is asking too much how about shortening the transfer window the way clubs spend the summer talking and posturing then get down to business in the last few available weeks is becoming tedious the beginning of august might be a better deadline it could leave clubs such as everton and blackburn in the lurch though anything that encourages clubs to get their deals in place before the season starts is to be encouraged there is always january for redress as it is everton will probably start to panic buy sometime soon while chelsea will bring in robinho with a day or two to spare and peter kenyon will still complain that clubs just below the top four are not doing enough to force their way into the elite perhaps it was ever thus but this close season seems to have gone on for ages and been completely dull why keep up the pretence that we are not all waiting for the football to start why not just start
617098 lazy white boys are missing out on footballs big time because they do not have the stamina of black children or play enough with their friends the manager of portsmouth last seasons fa cup winners claims black youths are physically stronger they can run all day he says in an interview redknapp also argues that british children dont spend enough time dribbling the ball in contrast to countries in south america and africa where youngsters spend hours kicking balls on beaches and waste ground in their bare feet i feel there is a lack of talent coming through he says in the interview in the september issue of esquire magazine
617099 the premier leagues proposal for a 39th game an international round of competitive matches is still very much a possibility a league executive told observer sport last night however the executive also admitted that another less controversial alternative is being explored for all the 20 clubs to play each other in preseason friendlies around the world possibly as a forerunner to a future competitive round
617100 real madrid last night stepped up their bid to lure cristiano ronaldo from manchester united coach bernd schuster turned up the heat after real beat hamburg 2 1 at the emirates by admitting i want him and his comments are bound to infuriate united boss sir alex ferguson who has grown sick and tired of reals endless pursuit of his player
617101 cristiano ronaldo will demand to be allowed to move to real madrid when he returns to old trafford on tuesday after the spanish champions publicly reiterated their desire to sign the portuguese winger after weeks of speculation ronaldo will attempt to force manchester uniteds hand by meeting sir alex ferguson the manager and david gill the chief executive to insist he be allowed to move to the bernabeu
617102 manchester united said their formal farewells to ole gunnar solskjaer at old trafford the former united striker turned out for his testimonial against espanyol as his old sparring partner teddy sheringham watched from the directors box the presence of the two former strikers serving as a reminder of the key personnel issue currently facing sir alex ferguson
617103 sir alex describes his path from the humble tenement close at 6 broomloan road to the splendour of old trafford as a bit of a journey but im still the same boy from govan i always was
617104 who knows gareth barry a man who had set his heart on the champions league challenge offered by liverpool and was virtually out the villa door may yet join the jubilant keane such is the nature of football brinkmanship and if so of all the deals currently enriching players and their agents but not necessarily clubs there is just a suspicion that these two would be the most significant and herald a change in the great order of things
617105 at last it seems some sanity is about to prevail from this summer of madness emmanuel adebayor is poised to end the brinksmanship at arsenal sign a new deal and so end all talk of a move to barcelona what a welcome contrast to some of the shenanigans that have rumbled on since the final ball of last season was kicked
617106 chelseas new boss now expects the england midfielder to sign a long term deal at stamford bridge
617107 i travelled with chelsea to china and malaysia and had the chance to watch at close hand their training and preparation for the new season deco stood out from the word go he is a player of exceptional quality really a very special player hes physically bigger than you might think but it is the speed with which he moves the ball his outstanding control and his comprehensive vision that make him exceptional he will give chelsea a whole new dimension to their play zola used to be excellent at breaking up the lines between the opposition defence and midfield and even though he operates in a deeper role this is a talent that deco also possesses
617108 there is no arguing with the abilities of modric bentley dos santos and arshavin but will there be balance as ever with tottenham there will at least be entertainment as we all find out the answer
617109 tottenham will have to spend 19million and make andrei arshavin the highest paid player in their history in order to sign the russian playmaker from zenit st petersburg but roman pavlyuchenko arshavins compatriot and fellow spurs target says he would rather play for arsenal or chelsea uefa cup winners zenit are prepared to reward arshavins loyalty to the club by giving him the move to the premier league which he craves

617111 newcastle are at the centre of a massive 260million takeover battle between two of asias richest companies
617112 we know that barton has rarely helped himself in the past that he hasnt learned lessons that he has been outspoken when humility would have been preferable we know that some of his advisers may not have been the best and may not be now we know he has previously failed to mend his ways despite promises to do so but we should also remember he has never been in jail before the shock to the system of being imprisoned does change some men it is the jolt that makes the difference i have seen that process occur with people i know whether that will be the case with joey barton nobody can say right now but whether following a suitably long ban he plays football for newcastle or elsewhere it is surely right that he be allowed that opportunity that is the measure of a civilised society
617113 those who stick up for barton argue that convicted offenders who have been punished by the courts should of course be allowed to work again call it uh rehabilitation well up to a point this is fair enough as in the case of oldhams lee hughes despite him having killed a man through dangerous driving absconding from the scene and being sentenced to six years in jail hughes may well be obnoxious but at least he appeared genuinely repentant of his criminally dangerous driving and cowardice in fleeing the scene of his crime there is not however even the whiff of repentance from barton he is a serial offender who has apologised to nobody in person least of all dabo and you suspect this is because barton believes he is somehow justified in his behaviour its that higher calling again a magnificently overweening ego even by premier league footballer standards allied to intense and consuming stupidity even by premier league footballer standards and calling him troubled rather than repulsive offering to work with him while paying him sack loads of moolah will not in the end help barton very much either
617114 everton the premier league football club could be put up for sale if the government approves its new 50 000 capacity stadium in kirkby a decision is expected within days it is understood that tycoons from india russia and america will swoop for the club if the green light is given to the 400m stadium project on the outskirts of liverpool it is thought an offer would not be rejected out of hand by evertons high profile board which includes theatre impresario bill kenwright and planet hollywood founder robert earl

617117 mr brown said he was sorry that we had not been recognised before
617118 he came round and shook our hands and he was a very nice genuine man to talk to
617119 it felt very nice to get a personal apology he was very genuine but it makes the others previous prime ministers look like they could not care less
617120 we should have had the same as the troops we faced a lot of what they did
617121 land girls did not get anything certainly no gratuity which was the decision of the prime minister at the time winston churchill and prime ministers afterwards
617122 the womens land army and womens timber corps worked tirelessly in the war years to keep this country going by providing food and supplies and timber for the war effort
617123 their work was absolutely vital and it is right that we thank them now for their dedication in the service of their country
617124 during the dark days of the war their contribution was as important as that of everyone who served
617125 i want to win every game i hate losing even if they are pre season games because i dont get much of a buzz out of it i get a headache if anything
617126 i just wish whoever is at the top of football would get together and have a mid season break because then your pre season becomes a lot shorter the national team would then be able to compete better in world cups and euros because our players wouldnt be fatigued
617127 we have to play six or seven games to give people the opportunity to show that they are good but i can tell certain players are not going to do certain things in pre season games
617128 as much as you try and tell them theyre not going to because they dont want to get injured and miss out in the first game in the league ive been a player myself and ive done it its not always 100 per cent correct but i know where they are coming from

617149 if you look at top performers in their 40s 50s and 60s the volume of training hours per day is sometimes down but they keep the intensity high they usually also do things to prevent age associated declines in muscle mass
617150 all things being equal the person who can put forth a maximum effort and at the same time relax has a real edge a lot of it is learning how to compete in a relaxed way when the pressure is on

617158 la situaci n econ mica es peor de lo que preve amos todos
617159 desde hace dos meses hay algunos datos radicalmente diferentes como la subida del petr leo o de los tipos de inter s que nos pueden dar la idea de que la situaci n econ mica es peor de la que preve amos todos

617161 hay que gastar mejor el dinero p blico y bajar impuestos a los que crean empleo
617162 estados de excepci n no democr ticos impuestos por francia y espa a
617163 no es justo que este asesino salga de la c rcel la grandeza del estado de derecho no es el cumplimiento de la ley sino que la ley sea justa
617164 si las leyes que tenemos permiten que un asesino pueda salir de la c rcel y permiten que nos sintamos como nos sentimos indignados esas leyes habr que cambiarlas porque las leyes para ser buenas han de responder a la sensibilidad de los ciudadanos a la dignidad y a la justicia y es en eso en lo que estamos trabajando
617165 a partir de ahora el gobierno la fiscal a general del estado los cuerpos y fuerzas de seguridad del estado van a estar especialmente vigilantes para que ni la memoria ni la dignidad de las v ctimas pueda ser vulnerada
617166 no nos gusta que de juana est en la calle nos repugna somos mejores porque acatamos escrupulosamente la ley y no toleraremos el menor atisbo de menosprecio a las v ctimas
617167 siempre ha tenido una actitud de desaf o al estado de derecho y a la democracia aunque ahora se acoja a los beneficios que le da precisamente vivir en un estado de derecho
617168 en el futuro las sentencias condenatorias de personajes como de juana establezcan con toda claridad que cuando cumplan la condena no podr n vivir al lado de las v ctimas para evitar un doble sufrimiento a stas
617169 cuando la mayor preocupaci n de los espa oles es el tema econ mico
617170 pueda aportar en positivo respetando el dolor de las v ctimas
617171 las medidas de excepci n que el psoe toma contra i aki de juana y contra el resto de presos pol ticos vascos

617173 el nuevo acuerdo en lucha antiterrorista estar listo en septiembre
617174 ahora lo que toca es comprobar si el gobierno ha rectificado y si es as nosotros le apoyaremos como dije tras mi reuni n con el presidente del gobierno
617175 nuestra intenci n es que el pacto sea una realidad en septiembre y lo presentemos en la cortes ese mismo mes los aspectos m s importantes sobre los que estamos trabajando son que los terroristas no puedan vivir cerca de sus v ctimas y sobre todo que los etarras abonen las indemnizaciones correspondientes a sus v ctimas y no puedan eludir su responsabilidad civil
617176 meses atr s fui tildado de catastrofista y antipatriota por decir simplemente la verdad
617177 lo que ocurre hoy es que la gente ha visto la evidencia de ese enga o y adem s comprueba la par lisis del gobierno ante la crisis
617178 tan s lo ha enga ado y ahora gobierna a base de ocurrencias porque no sabe hacer otra cosa
617179 esto va a ir a peor y vamos a pasar unos meses o unos a os muy dif ciles
617180 la situaci n econ mica es peor de lo que preve amos todos
617181 en aquel momento honestamente lo pensaba as con los datos que ten amos pero siempre dije que era exagerado si por crisis entendemos recesi n
617182 desde hace dos meses hay algunos datos radicalmente diferentes como la subida del petr leo o de los tipos de inter s que nos pueden dar la idea de que la situaci n econ mica es peor de la que preve amos todos nosotros pens bamos que iba a ir algo m s lento y al final ha ido m s r pido
617183 si no nos da m s sorpresas el petr leo si no hay otras variables con impacto negativo pensamos que vamos a tener una situaci n de muy bajo crecimiento o crecimiento plano en los pr ximos trimestres pero no estamos pensando en una recesi n
617184 si los precios del petr leo se estabilizan a partir de septiembre deber amos empezar a ver una ca da de la inflaci n a fin de a o deber a estar en el entorno de 4 o incluso por debajo y en europa cerca del 3 el bce est m s preocupado por las expectativas de inflaci n y esa evoluci n afectar tambi n a su reflexi n eso nos permitir pensar que la estabilidad de tipos puede producirse pero son decisiones que el bce adoptar de acuerdo con su estrategia de pol tica monetaria

617186 hay que gastar mejor el dinero p blico y bajar impuestos a los que crean empleo

617188 dinamice la econom a del pa s bajando la carga de impuestos a quienes tienen la capacidad de producir empleo gastando desde las administraciones p blicas lo justo y gast ndolo mejor defendiendo lo intereses de las empresas espa olas fuera y haciendo un pa s m s atractivo y con capacidad para competir con una industria creativa y puntera ya que no podemos hacerlo con el petr leo y la mano de obra barata
617189 el principal problema es que nos financian desde fuera y ya no tenemos la capacidad de obtener esa financiaci n barata demostrando capacidad de crear nada

617280 there are very few genuine and honest marketers on the internet and most of the big names you will see and here about are not among them if you read my blog you will often find reports of my investigations i do into the claims of top marketers who in my experience rarely practice what they preach
617281 on a more personal note i genuinely like to help people although im often given cause to wonder why some people can be very difficult to help and i also know that some people are beyond help but i always try my best for them and thats all anyone can do

617318 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
617319 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
617320 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
617321 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
617322 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
617323 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
617324 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
617325 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
617326 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
617327 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
617328 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
617329 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
617330 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
617331 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
617332 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
617333 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
617334 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
617335 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
617336 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
617337 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
617338 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
617339 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
617340 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
617341 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
617342 im throwing these starfish back into the ocean you see its low tide and all these starfish have been washed up onto the shore if i dont throw them back into the ocean theyll die up here from lack of oxygen
617343 but there must be thousands of starfish on this beach you cant possible get to all of them and dont you realize this is probably happening on hundreds of beaches all up and down this coast cant you see that you cant possibly make a difference
617344 when not interfered with by outside influences everything nature does is done with perfection yet my son shay cannot learn things as other children do he cannot understand things as other children do where is the natural order of things in my son
617345 i believe that when a child like shay comes i nto the world an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself and it comes in the way other people treat that child
617346 were losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning i guess he can be on our team and well try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning
617347 the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world
617348 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
617349 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
617350 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
617351 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
617352 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
617353 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
617354 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
617355 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
617356 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
617357 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
617358 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
617359 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
617360 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
617361 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
617362 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
617363 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
617364 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
617365 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
617366 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
617367 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
617368 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
617369 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
617370 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
617371 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
617372 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
617373 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
617374 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
617375 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
617376 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
617377 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
617378 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
617379 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
617380 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
617381 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
617382 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
617383 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
617384 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
617385 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
617386 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
617387 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
617388 who are open to doing something on the production side
617389 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
617390 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
617391 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
617392 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
617393 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
617394 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
617395 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
617396 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
617397 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
617398 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
617399 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
617400 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
617401 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
617402 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
617403 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
617404 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
617405 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
617406 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
617407 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
617408 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
617409 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
617410 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
617411 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
617412 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
617413 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
617414 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
617415 the scene was overwhelming and i cant explain the stench
617416 every room was filled with animals and they were in the beds and everywhere

617721 schlie lich habe ich hier eine sch ne zeit gehabt und mich sehr wohl gef hlt doch ich sehe bei galatasaray die bessere sportliche perspektive
617722 ein gro teil meiner familie lebt in istanbul so dass ich mich schnell zu hause f hlen werde
617723 wir h tten mit alparslan gerne weiter zusammengearbeitet und auch seinen vertrag verl ngert aber er hat den wunsch ge u ert zu wechseln diesem wunsch sind wir nachgekommen
617724 dieser wechsel zeigt erneut dass unsere ausgebildeten spieler immer auch interessant f r andere vereine sind
617725 das ist f r uns sowohl sportlich als auch menschlich ein gro er verlust aber ich kann verstehen dass galatasaray f r ihn eine gro e chance ist
617726 the worst nightmare that can happen to any human being
617727 i actually talked with street on friday and just said with the way blevins is throwing and ziegler is throwing i could potentially use anybody in any situation right now
617728 yeah with the flexibility that i might use somebody else
617729 closing is what ive done my whole career do i think ive been as good as ive been my whole career no but i still think theres two months left in the season for me to prove myself or prove myself to them
617730 and when he did throw strikes they werent in the right location
617731 i felt really good thats the best ive thrown the baseball in a month and a half
617732 the only thing i thought about that was when they had a guy on second maybe they had an idea of what i was throwing they were leaning out over the plate when i was going to throw outside
617733 the first one i was just getting familiar with the mound again
617734 the second one i tried to piece it together as if it was a one run game i was able to throw my sinker and off speed pitches for strikes
617735 da muss dann der rettungsassistent aussteigen und zu fu die stra e ablaufen
617736 i like the way he handles a broad range of subjects in an engaging and friendly manner definitely one of the good guys
617737 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
617738 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
617739 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
617740 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth

617744 i was in belgium vanessa i just returned did you have a nice trip
617745 well you are here now and we are going to do a little sightseeing here in seville do you speak any spanish
617746 i can count to 10 000 and i know a few phrases
617747 thats an excellent start vanessa spanish is the third most spoken language in the world its a good one to learn
617748 no its mandarin chinese spoken by about a billion people english is the second most spoken language
617749 i know vanessa and im really sorry really i am
617750 its just that i want to be someone special i want to do something important with my life i want to leave my mark on the world
617751 you are special vanessa ive ive never known anyone quite like you
617752 but dont worry if i do ill be sure to recycle myself
617753 i thought of a way to leave my mark on this world
617754 i think the next time im going to make a color copy
617755 yes with that nice flamenco guitar player we met on the street yesterday
617756 s l es muy agradable y toca la guitarra muy bien
617757 dont let your babies grow up to perpetuate the exploitation and oppression of women through the use of vile sexist comments and by creating a culture which is extremely unfriendly to women in professional and political ie non family oriented roles

617762 a dissonant 12 tone piece but youll like it anyway
617763 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
617764 clearly theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained

617766 as the nfl celebrates hall of fame weekend a future hall of fame quarterback brett favre is being told by his team that he cant leave the plantation that he wont be released that he wont be traded to a rival that he will be traded only for a kings ransom brett favre deserves better
617767 i got to cut it guys im going to look like a baby now they got some rules here i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys
617768 i think it is clear that we have an issue here and something is wrong with the system flawed with the system and we have to address it
617769 i think its a disservice when players arent in camp and being paid properly
617770 it wouldnt hurt for roy to have an extra day anyway
617771 but theres more to come right now im focused on my next start
617772 its a clich but after a night like friday all you want to do is get right back out there make better pitches at better times it wouldve been tough to watch that one
617773 any time they walk a guy in front of you yeah its a bit of a slap in the face
617774 at over 70 m p h there was just so much spray
617775 all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were
617776 in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning
617777 i hit a lapped car with no brake lights i have no idea who it was
617778 its still one match im so excited about this about my game and that im in the final of a tier i for the first time i will try to play my best today
617779 i feel like i belong in the top 20 and maybe i can be still better
617780 im really happy to be there because my goal for this year was to start in the top 50 and now i will get to the top 20 for me its like a dream
617781 shes playing like the number one player in the world
617782 it really helped me that it started raining because i was able to go in the locker room and talk to my coach
617783 it wasnt easy to talk to my coach because he was really mad then i realized that if i start to play my game to put more pressure on her to step in the court then i have a chance to play against her and to win this match
617784 when you start a match on one court im sorry you should finish on the same one
617785 i was in the sports centre at the university of calgary and people were like omigod whats wrong whats wrong i was like they qualified i couldnt believe it it was so surreal at first
617786 and even in a team sport you need to find your way to get ready to perform at your best that usually doesnt involve making time for other people your priorities have to be clear i understand that she understands that
617787 my eyes hit her and i was just like shes the most beautiful woman ive ever seen in my life
617788 i could always hear someone trying to catch up to me and i knew it was a guy because a girl couldnt catch up
617789 and i was like why do guys always have to beat the girl why do they always have to prove something id speed up or whatever
617790 one day i came late and so i caught up to him and we started talking and stuff i didnt realize it was him that was trying to catch up to me he tried not bad for a water athlete
617791 he puts himself out there and he knows what he wants he doesnt hide anything or tippy toe around anything thats whats impressive about him
617792 from that point on i was like it would be stupid of me to ever get rid of this guy
617793 hes very persistent but in a nonchalant way he didnt put pressure on me or anything to get into a relationship i almost came running to him after
617794 i knew quickly that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with her because shes just the most incredible person ive ever met
617795 so im sitting there and feeling down and then all of a sudden i see her coming in on crutches
617796 everything id been feeling bad for myself all that just kind of flew out the window
617797 we didnt finish when we got in the red zone but thats another problem to solve
617798 he is 150 pounds soaking wet and if you saw him on the street you would have no idea that he is our running back
617799 ive been playing this game all my life but there are still a lot of people who say a guy my size isnt supposed to be playing professional football
617800 but i never got the hint my first year of football i played offensive line i was 7 so ive always believed i can play with the big guys
617801 giz was the only one who didnt have great eyes but he had great burst he could see the hole and then accelerate through it he had enough strength to fight through some things whereas dominique doesnt have the great strength but he has the ability to bounce off people hes a little guy you cant knock down
617802 the injury happened in training it was very hard mentally at the beginning and i didnt know if there would be enough time for me to get ready and be fit for these olympic games
617803 but everything happened quickly and the recovery was fast my foot reacted very well to all the rehab plans that i had
617804 of course the chinese divers are the most powerful nation right now in diving despatie acknowledged
617805 but mens 3m is a very tough event and there are a lot of good divers it is going to be a good event for people to watch and a good event for us to dive in because the stakes are very high
617806 we have not seen you much in neverland these past several weeks so i imagine you have been to see her again
617807 and you wanted to grow old with her what a silly thought peter you who will never grow up here
617808 i dont but i cant help it i visit her daughter as often as i can even if i dont talk to her sometimes i watch her she is good at storytelling too but she is growing quickly the last time i saw her she was a foot taller nearly wendys height
617809 she does not want to stall her growing up does she
617810 i told her that was silly growing up is not exciting nor is it wonderful or painless
617811 i see only one answer to your dilemma peter and that is to go to wendy and stay there with her
617812 you should grow up peter it doesnt have to be painful when you are in love all should be happiness and contentment
617813 or else madamell skin your hide for sure are you new
617814 good dreams last night i suppose i bet they threw you in here late too so youll need a better rest tonight
617815 my names theodore but everybody calls me theo well have time to talk later but for now youd better get dressed and meet us downstairs or youll be getting off to a rougher start than i did
617816 here you can borrow some of my old clothes theyre far too small on me but you look just the size
617817 that ought to do go on get dressed i wont peek
617818 there are shoes and socks in there too help yourself ive got to help the others get ready but ill come back for you and show you down to breakfast
617819 though i am sure she was someone important and beautiful
617820 wont find much of that kind here seeing as how there arent any girls here least of all women well except for madame and the other sisters but having any kind of impure thoughts about them will get you into more trouble than a caning for sure what did you say your name was
617821 what did you think you were doing all day learning ballet
617822 i suppose youve been home schooled until now that would explain your emotionless and shock did they give you paper and things
617823 no but some other boys lent me some things like these pens
617824 well ive got some extras from my allowance that i can loan you as well and ill sneak some from madames stash so youll be set for the rest of the week
617825 best not to stare or try and rouse them from their studies
617826 well i suppose you could call it studying but theyre merely finding new verses of the bible for contemplation
617827 you alright peter sorry had to go and settle my things i have my own room since im oldest but sometimes i miss sleeping in here with the rest of the boys
617828 its hard i know its hard being thrown in here and expected to mind your ps and qs like you really know everything when im sure youve never so much as a seen a nun before and probably never been forced to eat oatmeal for breakfast every day either i know its tough especially since you seem to have a past like mine but it gets easier it really does
617829 so just take it slow if you have questions im here so no worries alright mate
617830 oh so you call this storm a welcomed insistence upon our happy spring planting season
617831 i am sure you would though we dont have such a sense of humor
617832 there has not been such an odd tempest since wendy left to grow up and i am sure i have not seen any new mothers come and go since so i am confused at your sadness
617833 the clouds are proof to all who occupy this small land
617834 did someone tell you i was sad peter pan is never sad for he doesnt understand sadness or know its nature you can tell that to captain cutthroat and he will learn his lesson for meddling in pans rumors
617835 of course not tiger lily is one of the smartest girls i know
617836 then explain your emotions you are crying you have not cried in a very long time since
617837 oh wendy ive wonderful adventures to tell you captain cutthroat has joined up an army and has captured every single fairy and the lost boys and i we took the ship by storm and even traveled with indians and formed an alliance to save them
617838 peter please dont come closer i will not invite you in
617839 are you to tell me i cant enter my own house wife
617840 no peter she is not your daughter this is not a game
617841 moira is my real daughter do you understand she will grow up here with me
617842 but you wouldnt hear me and truthfully i almost didnt want to spoil it for you but well there it is this is moira my daughter and over there is marcus and over here in the crib is benjamin
617843 peter peter will i see you again please will you come back sometime ill tell you stories i have endless amounts of them
617844 we can afford to send her to a private school
617845 of all the things i never wanted for my child
617846 besides if you keep placing it my hand and expect me not to want it you must be very foolish boy
617847 are too why were you calling this a kiss dont you know what a kiss is
617848 youre holding it right in your hand and you dont even know what a kiss is you must have never been in love thats why i couldnt give the kiss to you after all thats why you mustnt keep it
617849 youre peter pan arent you my mother says i shouldnt leave the window open for you but i knew youd come back
617850 do you know that my mother tells stories of you and your adventures
617851 of course im the hero i bet theyre lovely stories can you remember any of them
617852 i suppose you should tell it to me first then
617853 do you think i could give you a real kiss
617854 i shall close the window then if youll be leaving
617855 well peter you are doing a sore job of tying your tie so i suppose your mother always used to do it for you
617856 sorry mate i know youre new and all i shouldnt have teased you hell i know how you feel i lost my mother at your age probably younger
617857 and i really didnt mean anything by it but around here youve got to really keep your chin up and try to overcome those kinds of thoughts
617858 or youll be dead meat as they say there you are all done now lets get down to breakfast and then ill show you to your school
617859 youve never been yet have you its a real challenge honestly but a good one starting in a new place and all without knowing a single soul
617860 i mean school is always a challenge especially if youre from another country which no doubt you are swedish
617861 if its something awful im sure im not it though if its pleasant i might be inclined
617862 peter youre going to have to learn your manners and answer people straight away when they ask you a question
617863 theres madame youll want to watch out for her if she catches you in my clothes shell holler something wicked but as youre new and she probably hasnt caught on yet to your appearance you should be safe just keep quiet and stay calm and when you eat make sure youve got your mouth closed
617864 shh well be seated now so stay close to me and keep quiet
617865 blimey they really ought to have you prepared on your first day i suppose you came here in a rush arent you going to finish your oatmeal you wont get another bite until tea
617866 suits me fine but id better eat it so madame doesnt think youre being ungrateful
617867 need to ask madame for a coat or youll be freezing with how bad off your clothes were no doubt youre not used to our english winters they can be brutal
617868 what an ass that was just a leaf falling from that tree you nitwit honestly a dragonfly
617869 i saw its wings fluttering it was after that new boy

617874 excuse me did you really just ask me to stop smoking
617875 mein curriculum blogae mein blog ist seit ber drei jahren online
617876 i have no doubts about my captaincy ability but i am not scoring runs as a number three batsman i set myself high standards and in this series ive not got anywhere near those standards
617877 but if i dont play well it is irrelevant where i bat
617878 we do not have any strikers apart from wayne rooney and carlos tevez and frazier plays in that area
617879 he is quick and determined and he can do very well in the game fraizers future is here
617880 fraizer campbell has taken his goal very well and it wont do him any harm hes an aggressive young player
617881 we are also hoping to apply for a work permit for manucho who comes from angola that will give us more back up
617882 michael carrick and wayne rooney have been struggling with a virus for a few days and they wont be fit for the juventus game on wednesday hopefully they will be ready for the community shield next sunday
617883 i could probably bring ole on for the last 10 minutes even now and he wouldnt let us down
617884 it was a very emotional day for him and fully deserved
617885 i have had more than a year to get used to not playing but it doesnt get any easier and i knew this would be my last game at old trafford
617886 the first irregularity i would mention is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
617887 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself
617888 wayne had to take the responsibility of leading the line on his shoulders and he was awesome
617889 in a few years well look back and say at such a young age for a double winning team he did well
617890 i know the manager wants to help wayne develop even further and i know he can get even better
617891 i cant believe that some people were going on about wayne not having had a great season
617892 he scored something like 15 goals and had 15 assists a lot of players would be delighted with that
617893 you might have some players scoring 25 and having two assists but theres a lot more to wayne than scoring hes a more complete player
617894 i know the manager wants to see wayne playing in his more accustomed position just off the front
617895 a unique blend of science faith and lyricism reading it is a bit like having tea with an educated christian hobbit

617924 theres no money theres no possessions only obsessions i dont need that shit
617925 the discussions i have had are those that led to the commitment outlined in the one wales programme of government
617926 i find it frankly unbelievable that the first minister has had no discussions whatsoever in the last 12 months about the timing of a referendum
617927 winning a referendum requires considerable political leadership knowing when to call it and being prepared to campaign for it are the two crucial components
617928 rhodri and his plaid cymru sidekick have been keen to avoid the question of campaigning for it
617929 the clock is ticking on this the number one commitment in the one wales agreement we know that rhodri will not be leading the labour party at that point in time but the test of leadership is whether you leave an organisation in good shape for the next leader by ducking the crucial questions on devolution rhodri is letting down his successor and more importantly letting down the people of wales
617930 devolution may well be a process rather than an event but for wales to progress and remove the barriers that westminster continues to place in our way it needs strong political leadership
617931 the first minister is easing up as he heads for retirement
617932 so much energy in wales is being wasted on a politics which does nothing to change and improve things for the people of wales
617933 both conservative parties the red one and the blue one are taking it in turns to hold wales back

617938 this is history i believe if he siloko would come up to say something he will say that im blessed to die in because everywhere the news of the festival reaches people will talk about the festival they will always mention garry george siloko
617939 thank you profoundly for what you have done not only this morning but since the arrival of the delegation on the 18th of july
617940 george would like this choice to participate in the festival even in death and return with the team

617943 but ger is one of the strongest climbers out there and that gives us great hope
617944 we will continue to pray for his safe return and the safe return of his colleagues
617945 we hope itll become a mass medium but we need to develop the proper infrastructure in terms of the networking and of people learning more about blogging
617946 the basic question is how are we going to adapt my aim is to help you find ways of adapting that work for you
617947 its our belief that these days theres no journalism thats not online journalism so its crucial to extend online training to as many journalists as possible from cub reporter to veteran correspondent so that they have an opportunity to fulfill the expectations they have for themselves and their societies
617948 the information was concentrated and important so i suggest the organization of specialized training in photography and audio and video editing separately
617949 youll see the results as soon as i return to baghdad

617952 in plaats van te zeggen dat we zouden verder bouwen op de verwezenlijkingen hebben we onze eigen tien jaar bestuur aangevallen

617954 numbers is the special language of mathematics and hawaiians had developed a numbers system of their own long before the arrival of captain cook hawaiians had adopted a base unit of four in addition to a hybridized base ten numerical system the hawaiians base four units were called kauna or four kaau or forty lau or four hundred mano or four thousand kini or forty thousand and lehu or four hundred thousand according to j h k nepuu a hawaiian author of a letter to the editor of the hawaiian newspaper ke au okoa dated january 21 1867 the number four was used for a very practical reason a fisherman could hold four fish by their tails between the five fingers of each hand or a farmer could hold four taro plants in the same way incidentally fisherman and fishmongers in hawaii today still count fish particularly pelu according to the old method in units of four forty and so on

617961 i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love
617962 to me face to face he always told me he wants to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me
617963 he is not going anywhere even if you come with a 747 plane full of money
617964 we had a very young side especially in the first half and played well
617965 we were unlucky to concede the goal and maybe lacked a bit of experience to score as well as some physical match sharpness
617966 there were some heavy legs but it will get better over the next two weeks
617967 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have
617968 if we can find someone the we will do it if not i am happy as well
617969 do not form an impression on his small size because he is not phased by the physical challenges
617970 he really looks mature on the pitch but he is 16 and we have to respect his development
617971 however do not reproach me now about not playing english players
617972 what pleased me was our defence and we did a lot of things well
617973 however we took a lot of time to get into the game
617974 in the first half especially we looked tired and its not like weve played a lot of friendlies
617975 but we began to get more into it in the second half and we succeeded in doing well
617976 winning this competition doesnt interest me apart from the fact that its always nice to win something
617977 it would be nice to win for the fans but they know that were working to prepare ourselves well for a good season
617978 hes fantastic its as if hes always played with us
617979 hes everywhere even when we dont have the ball and his passing is brilliant it really seems as if hes been with us for years
617980 it was a difficult match where only one goal won it
617981 it was a very difficult match for us even though we are aware that we dominated
617982 but its the team of the highest level and we are already trying to work towards the preliminary round of the champions league
617983 tomorrow we have another difficult game and then we have another one against
617984 but these are matches that are at the highest level matches that the team need and matches that we need to win
617985 but i think we have a good team and that we have a great desire to win and that things are good all in all
617986 this is an offer we wont even discuss thats why we turned it down instantly
617987 rafael is one of the best playmakers in europe they real madrid made what we considered to be a ridiculous offer for him and that is all i am prepared to say on the matter

617992 if they complain of pain in the ball of the foot i ask them if they wear flip flops or walk around barefoot
617993 theyre also fine if youre not on your feet a lot
617994 people shouldnt wear flip flops if theyll be spending time shopping in malls or doing something like visiting an amusement park
617995 there is dutch wonderland amusement park buggy rides through amish country the strasburg railroad
617996 moreover many of our attractions offer adult tickets under 15 with youth tickets about half the price
617997 add that to the bargains at our famous outlet shopping and numerous free summertime events and its no wonder that tourism dollars go about 10 percent further in boston
617998 we love to go to the green dragon farmers market for its local flavor the homemade root beer cheese bread and sticky buns

618001 hotels waar kinderen niet toegelaten zijn bestaan al sinds de jaren negentig in de cara ben
618002 van daar is het fenomeen naar europa overgewaaid we hebben nu ook een aantal hotels in onder meer griekenland en turkije en we zien absoluut een stijgende vraag daarom pakt thomas cook deze winter ook uit met een speciaal logo in de brochure vakantie zonder kinderen
618003 het zijn vooral koppels die zon reizen boeken maar een leeftijd valt er niet op te plakken
618004 wat ze gemeen hebben is dat ze op vakantie geen week tussen de jengelende kinderen willen zitten het gaat wel bijna altijd om hotels in de hogere prijsklasse vaak zijn ze sterk gericht op wellness

618006 ik had mijn vader die aan vissen was een bezoek gebracht en was op weg naar huis toen ik een oudere vrouw naar me zag zwaaien
618007 ze vroeg of ik kon zwemmen twee minuten eerder had ze een vrouw aan de rand van het water zien liggen ik ging de steile kant naar beneden en probeerde contact te krijgen met de vrouw die in het water lag ze was duidelijk in shock alleen haar hoofd was boven water de andere vrouw had de hulpdiensten al gebeld een jogger en een fietser waren intussen gestopt en ik had mijn jongere broer opgebeld hij bracht een lange band mee waarmee we de vrouw rond haar middel konden vastmaken met voorzichtig wat duwen en trekken kregen we haar even later op het droge plots was er ook de waterpolitie die hebben de vrouw in een folie gewikkeld we hebben ook op haar rug gewreven zodat ze het wat warmer kreeg en nog een warmtedeken over haar gelegd

618013 if costs are rising here due to higher fuel prices and food prices are going up then our workers too should be entitled to what is deemed fit by the malaysian government

618015 to the most football knowledgeable fans to our fans i share this day with all of you
618016 what ive tried to convey to the people who were upset with the process was that i was ok with it
618017 as great as this honor is its not what defines who i am
618018 its been a success on the soccer side its moved forward weve gotten the interest in the league that weve wanted to which has brought success
618019 if you bring over someone you know is injured and make hoopla about it and try to get the non mls fan and all youve got is beckham injured you just lay an egg they deserve failing because they set themselves up to fail
618020 it was a smash and grab they wanted the money and season ticket sales and didnt take into consideration he was injured it was fraudulent and disingenuous to sell beckham ticket packages when he didnt play
618021 go and ask the average american sports fan about giving mls a chance this year and they say the mls overpromised and underdelivered
618022 in the passing game well use him everywhere possible as a deep threat as a short threat as a crossing threat watching him out there hes really comfortable with himself and weve got to be careful not to overload him and take away from what hes there for and what he does really well which is running the football
618023 what well do with him is try to take advantage of his speed and maybe like theyve done in the past well try and get him down the field and more or less like a wide receiver move him out and move him around at first it was so different for him but hes really adapted very well to it
618024 hes made so many plays more than anybody else maybe everybody else combined in the passing game
618025 part of that is he does know our offense he knows our audibles he studies really hard thats part of that hes come out and hasnt missed a beat it doesnt say much for really needing mini camps and ota organized team activities days
618026 hes one of the main reasons that were doing that drill
618027 weve just got to get him into game shape so that he can play a lot of plays for us so we dont have to be taking him in and out he should do a lot for us
618028 what smith did was wrong and we take very serious and he is being punished severely for it
618029 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
618030 i think had there been a unified boycott that would have been the most powerful statement that could have been made
618031 the opposition wasnt just the white sports establishment but the black sports establishment as well
618032 the historically black schools made it clear that they saw nothing of value in what we were trying to achieve
618033 they were not going to admit to a problem much less endeavor to make changes
618034 when the revolt took place at san jose state we got so many inquiries
618035 it dawned on us that black athletes across the country were isolated alienated and exploited
618036 people began to say hey is this where were at in this country
618037 we understood that was going to be our greatest contribution to heighten the contradiction between what is professed and what is actual
618038 we knew what the mileage capability of the proposal was
618039 tommie and john felt that a statement needed to be made but i didnt know what they were going to do
618040 when they did it i thought that it was not just fitting but a phenomenal end to what had been an 18 month struggle
618041 i thought it was dignified i thought that dr king would have agreed with it i thought that it was sufficiently militant it became the signature protest in an era of protests
618042 i look at the distance we have come but also at the amount of work that remains to be done
618043 i say no i was just a product of my generation
618044 im not really sure what happened but thats a done issue
618045 thats something that obviously people hear stuff im here practicing obviously cant wait until the season starts im in a great frame of mind
618046 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better
618047 it was a conversation where javon came in talked to me expressed it was something he was thinking about doing and a direction he may want to go
618048 so i told him to take a little bit of time go back to his room talk to people close to him then i put him in touch with al they had a conversation and then javon came back the next morning and said he wanted to keep going
618049 hes been the same since hes been here coming back plugging away trying to get ready for the season
618050 he seems to be fine to me not looking toward retirement but hes been through a lot so you never know
618051 from signing a big contract to being injured being released signing another big contact las vegas im sure hes been a little disappointed in his play out here and battling back from injuries theres a lot going on in his mind
618052 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
618053 across the spectrum of biothreats we have expanded our capacity significantly
618054 adherence to institute safety procedures by laboratory personnel is lax
618055 the chinese government would like to further its cooperation with saarc in promoting peace prosperity and harmony across asia and the world
618056 ooh papi te quiero mucho i love you better than any woman you know
618057 the government will not automatically be more open towards ngos
618058 but it has given them an opportunity to see the power of the grass roots and might start trying to establish a system for how ngos can operate
618059 the government does not fear ngos for what they are but for what they might become

618088 il giovane senatore rappresenta quello che molti oggi agognano carisma e leadership
618089 john mccain si fatto vedere al nostro convegno sul cancro organizzato dalluniversit statale e lui invece lo ha disertato
618090 non c dubbio che negli usa al contrario che in europa obama viene percepito in generale come pi debole di mccain come comandante in capo
618091 il suo tallone di achille la sicurezza nazionale per questo ha organizzato il viaggio allestero i punti di forza di obama sono invece leconomia e la politica energetica
618092 un problema assai pi serio del colore della pelle di obama
618093 tutti noi prestiamo pi attenzione ai dati che provengono dai singoli stati come ohio michigan minnesota florida e virginia e che fanno emergere un quadro di grande incertezza come gi accaduto in passato saranno in ogni caso gli elettori non legati ai partiti a determinare la vittoria
618094 organizzare una campagna elettorale presidenziale che comporta trattare con i leader locali selezionare il personale di fiducia e delegare le responsabilit gli sta conferendo una notevole esperienza manageriale
618095 la sua leadership mi ricorda quella di franklin delano roosevelt penso che obama come lui se sar eletto sapr trovare un modo inedito e coraggioso per far uscire lamerica da una congiuntura economica negativa
618096 potrebbe diventare uno dei presidenti che pi ispirano gli americani in tempi difficili come kennedy e ronald reagan
618097 intelligente e ha un impressionante istinto che lo porta a prendere le decisioni giuste inoltre sa entusiasmare i giovani come nessuno ha fatto dai tempi di kennedy e potrebbe essere in grado di mettere fine ai nostri infiniti dibattiti sul razzismo allo stesso tempo per obama sarebbe uno dei presidenti con meno esperienza nella storia americana e lopinione pubblica comincia a infastidirsi perch percepisce nel candidato democratico unarroganza e una sicurezza ai limiti dellimpudenza
618098 in definitiva trovo impossibile predire come si comporterebbe una volta eletto o se saprebbe tenere testa alle sfide da affrontare una gigantesca scommessa lincognita maggiore non sono i suoi piani per liraq leconomia o lambiente ma il fatto che abbia la forza politica e labilit per metterli in pratica
618099 welch ein zufall dass alle personen denen der kopf ge ffnet wurde ein gehirn hatten
618100 do you think we could have another chance at that
618101 eric had a dose equivalent to 190 years of background radiation
618102 johns was 107 the mods maximum safe dose was just 30
618103 hopefully this will mean they have to admit everything else
618104 there were 20 000 others there they and their families suffered just as badly
618105 in reality they have no idea who had how much dose eric and john had records taken but most had none those who had film badges for the explosions were made to hand them in and they were never labelled to show who was wearing them
618106 there is uniformity across the u s government about the way to proceed with iran
618107 everyone from this white house including the vice presidents office is in agreement that the military option is not the best option at this point and we should pursue diplomatic and economic pressures
618108 an american commitment to deterrence especially if seen by israelis as a substitute for prevention is itself likely to spur israel to consider independent action
618109 divers have fished out 32 bodies so far but we presume a few more bodies might be out there
618110 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
618111 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
618112 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
618113 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
618114 depend upon it if you are bent on prayer the devil will not leave you alone he will molest you tantalize you block you and will surely find some hindrances big or little or both and we sometimes fail because we are ignorant of his devices i do not think he minds our praying about things if we leave it at that what he minds and opposes steadily is the prayer that prays on until it is prayed through assured of the answer
618115 thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
618116 do not misrepresent the god whom you profess before men by your unholy lifestyle
618117 do not they blaspheme that worthy name character by the which ye are called
618118 that the name character of our lord jesus christ may be glorified in you
618119 let every one that nameth the name character of christ depart from iniquity
618120 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name character and in thy name character have cast out devils and in thy name character done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
618121 who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness
618122 as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth

618140 i now realise that art for arts sake was actually a cry for help from oscar wilde and his friends against the reality which is art for moneys sake it may be a long time before we see prices as good as these again but it may just be that we are at the start of a boom which could last as long as the one in the 19th century mainly 32 years between 1863 and 1895
618141 photography i think as far as other media are concerned is still undervalued in general primarily because it can only be as old as the invention of the camera
618142 in the early 1990s records were being set at 10 000 to 15 000 now records are being set at 2 5m or 3m for a photograph
618143 our average loan size is 5m so we arent going to have thousands of clients
618144 we deal with everybody but we dont make loans below 250 000 simply because were just not geared to that level of business that being said we would have to have a minimum value of 500 000 of collateral that we were lending on that still leaves plenty of collectors out there but we dont tend to do the smaller entry level type works
618145 no collector buys in a void nothing happens in the way of collecting without information information is at the core of it
618146 you cant be a collector by just looking around and picking things
618147 the last thing you want to do is to get somebody to buy something through your own passion and your own directive that theyre not engaged with because the process ends at that moment because then it just becomes get me a damien hirst get me a warhol and that isnt collecting
618148 in 20 years time i believe that the most expensive prices surfacing on the art market will be coming out of china and russia and india probably for artists none of us has heard of in the west and possibly for pictures that have not yet been painted

618183 car accident a young woman is lying on the ground unconscious
618184 you are not disturbing me you know that but it is your wish
618185 do you know this person i need to talk to
618186 its not fair to think of ken only in terms of gay rights because he was involved and cared about so many things the constitution education in alabama environmental issues animal rights
618187 kens death was such a profound loss for so many people and you cant just turn the page and say what do we need to pick up and do now because the grief is so great
618188 people need the time to heal from that loss grieving takes time
618189 if we stopped it now it would just seem like everything was for naught
618190 but that was in everyones mind evidently because they came together and weve started meeting getting organized and really trying to see how we can keep it going
618191 i wonder every day what have i missed today that ken would have noticed and called my attention to and challenged me to respond to
618192 i want people to know about it but i dont want to wave a red flag about it thats going to get certain groups up in arms but weve got to do this work
618193 what were really trying to do is communicate and educate and build a safe environment
618194 i dont want to ruffle feathers i want to move beyond this
618195 when you are the parent of a gay or lesbian child you fear what will happen to them when they go to school
618196 i think a lot of people would be scandalized if they realized how far behind alabama laws are
618197 we live in a state where its entirely legal to fire someone because of his or her sexual orientation
618198 when i first came here clergy who supported the church met in a secret place because they didnt want their congregation to know they were meeting with the pastor of the gay church
618199 it only takes one person in the pew to go after them and they could lose their church
618200 we have a sign in front of our church that says sanctuary open for all people
618201 the saddest thing that happens on a recurring basis is that someone will come in and say i drove past that sign 20 times and wondered if that meant me
618202 the guy turned to me and said what exactly do you do here
618203 as humans we are capable of great vision but were also capable of tearing down a vision in two minutes
618204 i think ken had great vision whether it was a weeded lot and an old house or hurt that could be transformed to joy
618205 he could see potential where everyone else would just see an old building
618206 were all capable of vision thats the challenge hes left for us
618207 its not fair but thats the way the law is written
618208 a school could make progress in all but one area and still not make ayp
618209 i dont think there is any state in the country that is near proficiency
618210 weve been watching other states and many of them have peaked out once they got into the 80s
618211 these programs have been the saving grace for this state
618212 the rest of the nation didnt know alabama was doing all that it does
618213 i dont quarrel with the overall goal of the law proficiency
618214 early intervention will no doubt be a part of it because we know through longitudinal research that early intervention has positive adult outcomes for children
618215 we also know that teacher quality makes a significant difference in student achievement
618216 people can save 10 on 100 worth of items they buy here and that can turn into gas
618217 were happy to have them here and hope theyll come back on sunday
618218 i think kids going into college or are in high school really like the prices they see here
618219 the reason is theyve really come down on laptops this year
618220 we wanted to see how much wed save without having to pay sales taxes
618221 if we could do that nsg process expeditiously we can deliver the package to the us congress in september we have a lot to to in short term we hope we can bring it to fruition
618222 well by the time we get to the nuclear suppliers group we hope no country will object
618223 seven bahai individuals have set up an illegal organisation with connections to a number of countries including israel and they have received orders from them to undertake measures against the islamic system
618224 this fact led to the arrest of seven individuals they have all confessed to the formation of an illegal organisation including having ties with israel
618225 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
618226 regulations are regulations the key will be whether they actually approve any protests and which ones
618227 over the past 18 years tens of thousands of people must have applied but at most a handful won approval
618228 given that they have announced these parks i think the government will want to show that citizens have scope to use them
618229 china wants to show it is progressing in human rights
618230 they were returning from the summit when an avalanche at the bottleneck hit them
618231 our liason officer at the base camp confirmed death of five
618232 this is a significant message from the chinese to say that china is now open to the world
618233 a splendid performance at the olympics opening ceremony is of major importance
618234 however we dont exclude that on the 8th of august there might be periodic rain
618235 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
618236 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy
618237 at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
618238 tony blair continues to be 100 percent supportive of gordon brown and the government
618239 the choice is and was always between gb gordon brown running as the change candidate or as continuity nl new labour
618240 establishment administration and police are sponsoring and fanning the cummunal violence in jammu
618241 hindu fanatic groups like bjp rss vhp praja parishad and panun kashmir are against the and just want to divide the kashmir on basis
618242 we moved to the airport during night hindu fanatics do not allow any movement during the daytime situation in jammu is very tense and fear psychosis is looming large
618243 only moderately well off and elite muslims are managing to move out from the jammu district the muslims who cannot afford or do not have resources are trapped in jammu city and facing the attacks of the hindu fanatics
618244 we have not slept for nights together because of the continuous threat of attack from the hindu extremists adding
618245 may be this is the last time i am writing something because hindu extremists outside are so furious that we may be killed any time love you pray for me
618246 in kashmir campaigns of murderous cruelty have been sustained for decades when the population gets tired of militant insurgency the repression seems to subside but when an act of police or paramilitary savagery is protested the orgy of murder and rape is re enacted
618247 on saturday the official tried to get hold of the girl and outrage her chastity after she raised an alarm people of nearby areas rushed to the spot and rescued her the official fled the spot

618249 ninety percent of pharmacy depots are based in jammu and due to the blockade we have not been receiving any fresh supplies adding
618250 he felt that everybody had worth that everybodys life was worth something that no matter how much you disagreed with someone everybody had a place at the table
618251 i was afraid for him going and he was a little nervous but he went
618252 they were shocked to see this white man there they frisked him but they let him in he was just there to support them
618253 they would find out who the car belonged to then call the persons employer
618254 tuesday there were twice as many people and i signed 40 or 50 and im just a public golfer
618255 i played on the south florida tour where i was the grandpa in the group
618256 i finished third once but i was getting more experience
618257 i missed qualifying for the final stage of senior tour q school four times
618258 i tried 18 or 20 monday qualifiers the heartbreak came in 2003 at a senior qualifier in los angeles i shot 4 under par 68 and everybody said oh youre in i waited around all day and in the second to last group a 67 bumped me out that was one of the low points
618259 then i met a wonderful women in phoenix named jan and we were married in 2005
618260 hes a 20 year old 1 handicap who grew up on this course
618261 another piece of evidence that the problems the company faces have no short term fixes and we would continue to avoid the shares
618262 being a parent is perhaps the only job where by the time you are finally trained you are out of the job
618263 cities of refuge they shall be for you and the murderer who killed someone unintentionally shall flee there
618264 if you violate a traffic law you are endangering the lives of other people you are therefore deserving of the biggest punishment
618265 but looking back over the years while my children and i miss her immensely we can nevertheless see that the experience has shaped who we are today and in most ways it has shaped us all for the better
618266 we must have been driving a zillion hours already i cant take it any more

618278 we are drawing a line and are going to start telling the real story the quiet majority of millions and millions of windows vista users out there are going to have a great experience
618279 people who are familiar with windows vista are two to three times more likely to have a favorable impression

618285 the world stand on three things on torah avodah prayer and on gemilas chasadim deeds of kindness

618287 let us love our china and restore our great wall
618288 i just watched a man rip off the head of my duck
618289 where the system falls down is in post operative care and management of conditions
618290 doctors and hospitals will usually expect immediate cash payment unfortunately foreign health insurance plans are not accepted directly by the hospital
618291 when i was young or in high school the whole family we would be sitting together cooking
618292 for more than 20 people who cooks its very hard and after that who does the cleaning so people go out to restaurants
618293 if you have a big family you want to eat at home if you are one person how many dishes can you make
618294 we want our wines to truly reflect this distinct location
618295 i hereby declare quasar the official tangency news herald first class of the most exalted of geeks who want to know so let it be written so let it be done
618296 this is tangency we flogged common sense to pay our pie bill a couple years back
618297 think 20 000 to 30 000 people all wearing costumes on the famous street that runs along the ocean
618298 badger is armed with a knife and a pair of scissors and he is defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
618299 ok badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
618300 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
618301 they did try to have him comply with demands to drop the knife
618302 he wasnt released friday because he didnt meet those conditions of the cash deposit
618303 yesterday morning he met those conditions that was what was in the works
618304 i really cant say anything about his case today whatsoever
618305 ah good old hellfire when regular fire simply wont do
618306 i will maintain that i will look anyone in the eye and state i have not killed jill dando
618307 to be quite honest and practical i dont think theyll ever find who done it
618308 i walked with her for a bit and from her perspective maybe it was unwanted attention
618309 but she didnt make that clear it didnt seem like she was telling me to go away if shed told me to leave id have done so straight away
618310 that was at 12 33pm i know because just a minute before id made a call from my mobile to check how much credit i had left
618311 i know i have done wrong in the past and if i could go back in time and change that i would
618312 we guarantee that this things going to be open by 11 oclock tonight at the latest
618313 we plan on enhancing the inspection program over the next year and a half on this road to eliminate the probability of this slide happening again
618314 its actually a world class program theres a risk of driving in british columbia and the risk of rock fall is much less than the risk of injury in a car accident
618315 the spokesman claimed the new carrier sub could carry 10 000 of the new fighters and if needed could blow itsef up on command
618316 guarda che quindici anni sono proprio tanti eh significa che mentre tu stavi cercando di uscire dallutero di tua madre lui stava gi cercando di entrare nellutero di qualcunaltra

618319 si riconferma la legge universale le coppie sono sempre una carina e uno stronzo una stronza e uno carino senn che ci facevo con andrea
618320 vedi ci sono due categorie di donne quelle che si fidanzano ma si scelgono gli uomini sbagliati e quella sarei io e quelle che non si fidanzano perch si scelgono gli uomini impossibili e quella saresti tu
618321 we here in muni land are fraught with several problems
618322 theres the whole credit crisis the fact that the insurance isnt worth the paper its written on and the possibility of rising interest rates
618323 if investors are paying any taxes on their investments at all they should consider municipal bonds at these prices
618324 the police assured us that the whole building is safe and that everything is okay so theres no point in canceling the shows
618325 the grenade probably came from the man on that motorcycle
618326 maybe the man just accidentally dropped the grenade when he was passing by that area
618327 we really want to know why this thing happened i dont recall anybody from peta receiving threats
618328 winning and doing it consistently are two different things we have to maintain that mindset
618329 in the past games weve been waiting for jewel and jahnke to step up
618330 our problem is our depth thats why were doing our best to give exposure to the younger players
618331 diana no tengo dudas al respecto tus s ntomas corresponden con un mal bastante com n que sufren millones de personas en el mundo tienes gastritis pura y dura

618333 if there was security in the south why would we come here
618334 we will stay here even for 10 years until the bombardment ends
618335 there were armored vehicles on the hill and they were firing there was a heavy bombardment and planes bombed too
618336 they did not differentiate between the guilty and not guilty
618337 defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
618338 badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
618339 based on what hes told me he imagined her as more of a curmudgeon kind of comedy relief a little bossy a little tightly wound
618340 i think i was sort of a little bit more female ish a little bit more overtly sexual and little bit more competent than maybe he had imagined the character
618341 im sure men feel this way too but certainly we do as women the way we choose to dress in the morning its how weve decided to present ourselves to the the world and i know that when i wear something like this it feels more fun and useful i act like that and when im in something more sleek and black i feel like i act more elegant
618342 i think putting on joans outfits all of a sudden im joan because i dont dress like that normally although i probably should because its sort of fabulous you put on the hair and the makeup and you really do feel different
618343 i think she really likes joans clothes which is funny because to me all of them are like so special
618344 every time i see january jones shes in some dress that looks like a festival im like oh my gosh youre like dream like a cotton candy cloud and elisabeth moss gets to wear these smart little things that i think look like they could be prada now i just think they look incredibly stylish and amazing on her were all so completely different and janie loves to make the special little belt and the little buttons and all the little details shell put it on and go christina she gets excited about every little detail and it makes it fun to do fittings with her
618345 i think its important as an actor to always find out how someone justifies their behavior
618346 in every episode of mad men you see a sea of women in the secretarial pool and each one of those girls came in and joan walked each one of those girls through just like she did peggy and they all listened to her or are trying or are working through these things and heres this young girl who isnt dressing the way shes been told to dress who is pursuing what seems to be a mans career joan cant figure out how thats going to possibly get her a husband its not that shes jealous i think shes just absolutely befuddled

618348 we await further news from the government of karnataka on the limitless dlf bidadi project but have every confidence that the development will go ahead as planned
618349 india is facing its biggest urban migration ever and our ability to masterplan large scale balanced urban communities allows us to help india address its growing demand for new homes
618350 it would be an enormous step backward vis a vis democracy if today over twelve years later only the two parties in parliament would be deciding exclusively between themselves on an issue which directly involves other political parties
618351 it is even more important than ever for alternattiva demokratika to participate fully in the discussions because the government of the day only commands a relative majority and represents less than half of the electorate
618352 it is therefore even more imperative that the committee discussing electoral systems and party financing should include ad in order to ensure the widest possible representation of the maltese electorate
618353 the hunting ban after 3 pm during the peak migration of birds of prey in september is a necessary measure to avoid the killing of these protected species by poachers last years ban proved to be effective as it helped the law enforcement units that monitor the hunting hotspots with their limited resources
618354 migration is natures one of the most spectacular events and raptor migration in september and october months is particularly significant in our islands birdlife malta will organise raptor watching days in september for its members and also for members of the public who want to witness this phenomenon

618359 people determine in the privacy of the voting booth which party they want to vote for which primary they wish to vote in
618360 this is unlike the presidential primary last january when voters did have a choice between two ballots based on which party they wanted to vote for
618361 we do allow a particular percentage for spoiled ballots due mainly to cross over
618362 but the end of the year is kind of tough to be on a losing streak
618363 it was a little nerve wracking because i havent seen live pitching in like two years
618364 its fun and it brings back a lot of good memories and it was fun to get dirty again because i havent done that in awhile
618365 hes been at us all year to have an at bat and he really deserved an at bat tonight so we gave him one he had a great year with us for sure
618366 we just want to let the community know were here

618369 its nice to get together with people and just talk get suggestions
618370 dry life and cinnamon life cereal with his vitamin sitting next to it every morning
618371 even on christmas no presents until he has his cereal
618372 its gotten to the point where we sometimes have to pick him up and move him
618373 he doesnt throw fits or anything but he just keeps saying this isnt how its supposed to be hes very verbal
618374 every where he goes he has a certain routine of how he does things
618375 in a lot of ways it does make us healthier we cant plan out our lives we have to adjust our plans
618376 we enjoy being with these folks because theyre inclusive very unconditional and i like that
618377 when we realized that there are other people who have the experience of having a child with autism its a wonderful thing this is a celebration
618378 the nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased and not impaired in value
618379 some items are up 70 percent from two years ago its getting out of control
618380 as a director i can look at it and say am i going to buy the cheapest food out there or am i going to keep the quality and integrity of the food
618381 for me im not going to reduce the quality of the food because it wouldnt be fair to the kids
618382 looking at your co op using your commodity dollars and finding out what items are there that you can leverage
618383 i could put as many numbers and percentages and anything in front of you
618384 weve all been to the store we all know where the prices are going
618385 where else can you get five different food components for a buck eighty five
618386 show me a restaurant that is going to serve you that amount of food for the same price
618387 the only worthwhile achievements of man are those which are socially useful
618388 i wish i could vote for a good person instead of having to choose between the lesser of two evils
618389 the ego is not sharply separated from the id its lower portion merges into it but the repressed merges into the id as well and is merely a part of it the repressed is only cut off sharply from the ego by the resistances of repression it can communicate with the ego through the id

618415 bob whats up with those sticks you use how come there are two what do the the controls do what are the pedals for
618416 well think of the rotor as one big spinning disk the stick on the left is the power lever it controls the total thrust that the rotor disk puts out the one between my knees controls the tilt of the disk and whichever way the disk is tilted is the direction the helicopter is going to go so if i push forward on the stick the helicopter moves forward if i pull up on the power lever we go faster or climb and since the helicopter can fly in any direction forward backward or sideways i use the pedals to keep the nose pointed straight ahead

618422 what did the authors of the gospels do in the congregations mainly in the cities around the mediterranean they found scores of narratives about jesus the beloved founder of the christian faith the writers took those narratives and frequently even remolded and refashioned them to bring out the lesson they wanted to teach

618448 what some media reported that kuwaits oil reserves are less than that is wrong and not based on scientific record on the contrary there are new discoveries
618449 and in moscow i have little doubt that i witnessed the infancy of change if only because for the first time the soviet regime had to open its doors to the world that is why the decision to go to beijing taken symbolically enough in moscow in 2001 was the right decision then and remains the right decision now

618489 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
618490 barack obama has played the race card from the bottom of the deck
618491 race plays a role in american politics in a lot of different ways its not just ku klux klan style racism

618493 its simple these are three of the biggest celebrities in the world thats why they were chosen

618503 i feel okay physically i am disappointed that i lost the fight i took the wrong approach freddie roach was telling me to move to my left and throw combinations but i couldnt get off i couldnt do the work that i normally do
618504 he kept throwing that lazy jab and i was lining up the straight left the whole night i was finally able to land it a perfect punch right over the top

618530 i would like to see us taking a lead in our churches and being very serious about auditing our carbon emissions
618531 certainly such public displays as floodlit churches are the worst possible witness we could make to a world using too much energy
618532 we were at point where it seemed the government had finally got the message and was implementing policies to reduce emissions and suddenly oil prices shot up and suddenly the government caved in over taxes on petrol
618533 in my life time weve gone from a view of the world as an almost infinite resource a dustbin with infinite capacity for our waste and infinite capacity for supplying what we want oil and coal its a sobering thought that the atmosphere this thin skin of air and water which relative to the size of the earth is similar to thickness of the skin of an apple contains everything we have and everything we know thats where all human civilisation has been all art all science all living things all religion we see now it is far from being an infinite dust bin it is an infinitely precious and infinitely vulnerable speck in the vastness of the universe we have to treasure it and nurture it
618534 i would like to see the church recognising that our responsibility to love our neighbours as ourselves extends not just to the person in the house next door not just to the people throughout the world but to the people of this whole interdependent planet

618599 one of my concerns is that we make sure we dont value speed as a goal so much that we drive down the values of cases and dilute our response to crime in a way thats not productive
618600 our first goals have been to make the system more efficient not more lenient
618601 well continue to focus to make sure the process is efficient
618602 we think that everything weve done is making some incremental change in getting some cases resolved
618603 one of the barriers to getting some of these reforms was the assistant district attorneys and judges dont feel like they have time to do any of these things
618604 to have someone who they can trust has been helpful
618605 our products continue to provide our customers with quality items at affordable prices
618606 the customer is being more value conscious because of our current economy many customers are paying more attention to the sales and actually purchasing more sale items than they did last year
618607 they celebrate a whole lot of things in florida but nothing like this
618608 we just came down here to grab some hamburgers i wasnt expecting all of this
618609 if miller park learned how to put on a spread like this they would be in business
618610 ive found it puts a whole new meaning in life when you can find simple things like mustard to celebrate
618611 you could put a ketchup museum inside a phone booth for all the variety there is with that condiment
618612 this was a shock to the whole community it still is
618613 thats all people can talk about today about how bad it was
618614 if somebody found out the truth would it create a credibility issue
618615 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
618616 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
618617 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding by travers and milgram
618618 via the lens provided on the world by messenger we find that there are about 7 degrees of separation among people

618624 we were denied a permit to build a commercial grain elevator for olsens mill based in oshkosh
618625 so we have decided instead to build a farm elevator to service the olsen brothers farm
618626 they have about 5 000 acres they own or lease and that is a lot of grain that needs to be stored and processed and they are going to do that it is our belief no permit is needed
618627 its a complicated issue but when this is finally built it will not be commercial we are not flouting the law there are literally hundreds of grain bins all over lafayette county built by farmers
618628 we didnt win and now we are back to square one
618629 is still in the plans but that is not being constructed now
618630 i cant say if there has been a final decision on whether that phase two will happen
618631 we tried to stop them from building their big commercial corn setup and that in turn has made them even madder
618632 its kind of wait and see they were buying all this corn for future delivery and they have no license to accept it here so it would have to be taken elsewhere
618633 for a small town this has gotten pretty nasty some are for it and some are against it
618634 i lived on a farm my entire life i know what corn bins do youve got the beeswings thin filmy pieces of bran released in moving corn and youve got the mice and rats
618635 its a good sign i think their business has been affected by it
618636 i believe that by not covering this kind of graffiti right away the city is condoning it
618637 sometimes officers just get involved in other things and forget to make the notification
618638 w ij verwachten dat de totale online bestedingen in 2010 richting de 10 miljard euro zullen gaan we zien dat grote retailers zoals bijvoorbeeld hema de online markt betreden bedrijven moeten nu vaart maken om ook van het online marktaandeel een percentage te werven anders wordt het straks lastig voor hun om de online omzet zeker te stellen
618639 will be catastrophic for this school district and catastrophic for our community
618640 theres no doubt in my mind we have to do something or a combination of things to address this gap
618641 we are trying to reach out to some businesses too to maybe help make up that last 11 percent
618642 we gave away 2 000 and we still had families showing up and missing out unfortunately
618643 das war die beste weltmeisterschaft seit es die rescue gibt
618644 the fcc proceeding concluding today has generated a healthy and appropriate debate about how isps should manage their networks there is no longer any doubt that isps have the right to use network management tools to address unlawful activity including the theft of copyrighted music we applaud chairman martins clear affirmation that isps may use technology to prevent the theft of copyrighted works there is a crystallizing consensus among governments around the globe that isps should be taking affirmative steps to address piracy on their networks it is our hope and expectation that isps here will accelerate their efforts to work with us to address online piracy

618650 ive run cross country for four years and a lot of courses are like this
618651 during cross country there are a few big hills in the woods but we didnt have to run them today so i was really happy about that
618652 road runners are concerned more about turning ankles on roots and things
618653 i thought it went very well id like to have more runners of course but for the first year this wasnt bad we can build on it get some of the bugs out
618654 they put a tent up across the runners path so you tall guys will have to duck
618655 i like running on the trails better thats what im more used to and i know these trails pretty good
618656 i did this when my little girl was this same age about 14 months i was surprised he did so well he didnt cry or fuss or anything he just rode smooth
618657 hes up a little before his get up time so he might not be fully awake but i was still pleased at how he did
618658 the roots werent as bad as i thought the grass is what gave me a struggle pushing him through the grass
618659 we had to do it on the same day or not at all
618660 all the help for the hinton area race comes from here
618661 it just made more sense to come here where we had help
618662 we decided to add it to the mercer county fair to give the kids an extra chance to get a little soccer in before the mercer county soccer league gets started a little bit later on in august
618663 weve got an agility station where theyll work on quickness and foot speed theyll learn to do the speed ladders and agility rings and the hurdles
618664 then at the footwork station theyll be doing some skill building activities like sole rolls
618665 ball control theyre going to be dribbling through arches theyll be dribbling through cones weve got several shooting stations where theyll learn to plant their foot and use their instep to make a good solid shot
618666 at the end we have to pull them together and all of the different activities that theyve done through the day with the shooting and passing and skills hopefully let them put some of that to use
618667 i believe that most of these kids are on a mercer county soccer league team
618668 but there werent any requirements you didnt even have to know how to play soccer before you got here so that was something we were hoping to be able to teach a few kids some fun things today
618669 i started out with my own kids when they were five years old with the game and had never played it before
618670 i was a basketball girl so i didnt know that much about soccer
618671 but as theyve learned and grown and gone to camps and clinics themselves ive kind of followed along with a notebook taking pencil and paper notes and watching videos and tapes and just trying to pick up the game a little bit myself and learn learn how to play it because that was not something that was in my realm of sports understanding
618672 like i said im a basketball girl so i spent a lot of time watching that and ive actually been able to pull some of the same concepts of basketball into soccer
618673 and its interesting how the two sports seem to go very much hand in hand even though theyre very different
618674 and watching how theyve listened so intently already this morning on just a couple little things theyve done and they try so hard to do it just like the players are teaching them how its fun to watch these little ones
618675 as the older kids teach they also develop a better understanding and its not just us for saying over and over and over to them
618676 once they start trying to teach them they begin to understand why weve been having them do all these drills all along
618677 in particular over the last handful of years in the pikeview area its grown tremendously
618678 were able to pull together just three or four years ago a middle school team that all of the pikeview area kids can play on
618679 and we were able to have enough girls last year that we were able to forma a high school girls team and that had never even been a thought really before
618680 so this year were looking at close to 20 boys and 20 girls coming out for the high school teams so just in the last handful of years it has gotten a tremendous boost
618681 i see these younger kids coming up and it just gives me so much to look forward to
618682 i see theyre learning skills at a younger age than even what the high school kids right now started learning
618683 i think its just nothing but hope for the future im real excited about what i see with these kids coming up
618684 you should either reduce the size of your breasts or get some new blouses
618685 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
618686 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
618687 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
618688 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
618689 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
618690 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
618691 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
618692 was concerned by high levels of hiv infection in the country
618693 we are working with the ministry of the interior in dealing with uncontrolled immigration of zimbabwean women who are engaged in sexual activities in central mozambique
618694 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
618695 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
618696 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
618697 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
618698 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
618699 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
618700 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
618701 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
618702 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
618703 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
618704 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
618705 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
618706 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
618707 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
618708 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
618709 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
618710 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
618711 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
618712 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
618713 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
618714 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
618715 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
618716 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
618717 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
618718 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
618719 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
618720 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
618721 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
618722 wir k nnen uns der ffentlichen meinung doch nicht in den weg stellen unsere kunden wollen von uns h ren dass wir den klimawandel ernst nehmen
618723 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
618724 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
618725 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
618726 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
618727 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
618728 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
618729 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
618730 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
618731 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
618732 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
618733 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
618734 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
618735 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
618736 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
618737 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
618738 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
618739 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
618740 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
618741 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
618742 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
618743 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
618744 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
618745 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
618746 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
618747 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
618748 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
618749 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
618750 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
618751 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy

618755 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
618756 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
618757 via the lens provided on the world by messenger we find that there are about 7 degrees of separation among people

618761 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
618762 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
618763 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
618764 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
618765 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
618766 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase

618770 as a legislator you see a lot of data on a daily basis and it gets a little overwhelming
618771 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
618772 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
618773 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
618774 and this has been one of the most arduous processes ive had to endure
618775 meaning they werent testing messages to see what was effective
618776 we want them to make sound policy decisions not poll driven decisions
618777 we want to make sure that were not in an echo chamber
618778 im going to work hard on foster care issues throughout my term because theres a lot of work to be done
618779 we talked about the oil boom weddings everything under the sun
618780 but nobody ever mentioned that missile i guess that shows that people arent worried about it im certainly not

618795 what did you give up all your loved ones all your privileges and at most nursing homes you only get to bring two possessions
618796 how many of you look forward to living in a typical nursing home
618797 we are getting frustrated because no one is caring about kids and that is what we are thinking about
618798 if we dont reach agreement then we wont take it off the ballot
618799 if this tax passes most of the residential development in north san jose wont happen
618800 certainly anytime you go to the ballot theres a risk but were pretty confident that well get the support
618801 if there was security in the south why would we come here
618802 we will stay here even for 10 years until the bombardment ends

618810 a scathing indictment of how profoundly u s and cdc hiv prevention efforts have failed there is absolutely no good news here without an accurate picture of the epidemic vastly underestimated for the last 10 years we have missed countless opportunities to intervene with

618812 if you are a young gay black man the likelihood that you will encounter hiv is staggeringly high even if your personal behavior is no more risky than people in other communities
618813 there are roughly 225 000 more people living with hiv in the u s than previously suspected
618814 said jeffrey adamovicz former director of the bacteriology division at the army medical research institute for infectious diseases or usamriid in frederick md

618822 the olympics have become a disaster because they bulldozed peoples houses and created this fake boom
618823 maybe the olympics will bring china a good image to the world but these goddamn games have made people commit suicide
618824 i dont like to see the olympics used as an excuse for the chinese communist party to persecute people
618825 im concerned that the olympics are being used as a propaganda tool
618826 i dont think making a mockery of the country is the way to go
618827 if you just keep pounding the government theyll just tighten up their security
618828 the torch run protests just gave the government a darn good reason to do that
618829 im proud that china is doing everything it can to make the olympics the best they can be
618830 i think the whole world is very excited about it

618848 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to

618898 i think from what jack tretton said the reaction has been well summarised by
618899 junked the blairite policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place
618900 i am passing this message on to gb not in these terms and will try to help but at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy tactically it was thought clever to define by reference to tb i e this was not the era of spin we are going to be honest the style would change etc strategically the consequence was twofold a we dissed our own record instead of saying we are building on the achievements confronting new challenges we joined in the attack on our own ten years a fatal mistake if we do not correct it and b because we were disowning ourselves as a government we junked the tb policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place so tactically we took the benefit of the anti tb feeling but strategically we ended up accepting our opponents propaganda and appearing incapable of articulating a forward policy agenda the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future the truth is that dc was in trouble long before tb left but that was because he was being forced to choose on nl policy and found as a result that he couldnt differentiate properly the tory policy is still not up to much but they are able to get traction on inheritance tax unbelievably boosted by our own briefing because otherwise the policy field is left wide open dc is confused by proper strategy but immensely empowered by short term tactics the choice is and was always between gb running as the change candidate or as continuity nl he never needed to worry about distancing on iraq it was never going to be seen as his issue but he really needed to be seen as continuing nl not ditching it by trying to be change he played exactly the same game the media wanted but never the game that gives us the only chance of a 4th term
618901 this is me taking back control of my life what the fuck have you done lately

618906 nyinyi vijana munafanya nini kwa buroti plot yagu nitawapereka kotini
618907 i used to go two or three times a week after work but now i just stay at home and go once every now and again
618908 i do more drinking at home now than at the pubs theyre more for special occasions since its becoming so expensive
618909 brewing is a major industry beer our national drink and pubs a treasured part of our national culture
618910 sadly the trade repeatedly shows that it cannot be relied upon to consistently act in a responsible way
618911 theyre increasingly more friendly to families the quality of the food has increased
618912 its an obstacle not to let the business run you if youre not careful it can consume you
618913 as that skill set is being cultivated is when i begin to see burnout occur
618914 youre not crazy and youre not lazy sometimes its just natural that it occurs
618915 it cant just be me sitting in my office making widgets anymore
618916 owners dont realize that they have to change they follow the definition of insanity thinking theyll do more of the same and get a different result
618917 some people say ive been doing it this way for 23 years and im going to do it 23 more nowadays that just isnt the case youre either moving forward or backward
618918 when you get into business its all exciting and fun
618919 but then as you start growing the business we got to a point where we needed to work on the business not in the business
618920 the numbers start piling up and you have the responsibility of now ive got to find work for this number of guys
618921 instead of just thinking about a couple of things youre thinking about everything

618927 i just was lackluster i just didnt have the get up and go
618928 burnout a lot of it is wallowing in the past things that have happened and not looking at the new things that are happening and reinventing yourself
618929 just like madonna shes 50 years old but shes always been able to come back and thats what you have to do
618930 a challenge in these times is the disappointment of we didnt get that job or we didnt get awarded that contract
618931 it is what it is a closed door today leaves room for a bigger door to open tomorrow
618932 you have to surround yourself with a diverse set of people in different types of businesses that are willing to mentor you you have to listen to what they have been through and learn from their mistakes
618933 wed just gone fishing 45 minutes prior to the notification of the fire

618945 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death

619002 los invito a pasar de la muy rica y apasionada presentaci n de cr ticas y propuestas desde espacios extra universitarios a un fruct fero e institucional debate en los recintos de sus rganos de gobierno de cara a la comunidad universitaria y la sociedad de jalisco
619003 a quienes han disentido de algunas opiniones o acciones del rector general los conmino a privilegiar nuestras coincidencias y a ser lo m s propositivos posibles a quienes por expresar sus puntos de vista o realizar alguna cr tica hiriente al rector general han lanzado alg n infundio les digo que de mi parte no hay rencor alguno
619004 escuchado le do y analizado con atenci n todas las preocupaciones que en este intenso y positivo per odo han planteado rectores de centro dirigentes de los organismos gremiales as como distinguidos acad micos
619005 respetuosamente y otras m s habr n de ser aclaradas porque pueden partir de una informaci n que no est debidamente sustentada
619006 el tema de la destituci n o la renuncia del rector no es una preocupaci n del consejo de rectores nosotros estamos haciendo un llamado a recuperar el curso de la institucionalidad en la universidad y creo que no ser a conveniente o ser a incongruente de nuestra parte que nosotros nos manifest ramos en ese sentido
619007 nos tiene sorprendidos esa transformaci n yo he trabajado con seis rectores y la verdad este me tiene sorprendido y me preocupa la desestabilizaci n por su cambio radical
619008 durante el ltimo a o se ha gastado alrededor de la sexta o la quinta parte de lo que se lleva gastado en el centro cultural universitario en ampliar la burocracia de la administraci n central
619009 las diferencias entre el rector general y la mayor a de la comunidad universitaria est n afectando el desarrollo acad mico de la udeg
619010 se dice que nos oponemos a la transparencia pero la transparencia no naci con el rectorado de carlos brise o viene desde el a o 2000 estamos abiertos a que la comunidad universitaria nos revise no nos pisan los callos con la transparencia
619011 antes se sesionaba en consejo de rectores dos o tres veces cada dos meses ahora van tres meses y seguimos sin sesionar
619012 ha tenido muchos gestos muy desagradables el hecho de viajar de cucea a rector a en un helic ptero y aterrizar ah sabiendo que iba a haber muchos medios de comunicaci n me parece que es un acto desagradable indigno de un rector adem s no sabemos qu habr atr s de intercambio con quien le presta el helic ptero
619013 es muy importante la discusi n al seno del consejo de rectores sobre todo para discutir el presupuesto y a qu destinarlo cuesti n que hemos visto
619014 el conflicto no naci hace tres semanas es a ejo y se origina por la toma de decisiones unipersonales por el rector general carlos brise o quiere se alar a un tercero ra l padilla cuando l lo ha estado colocando en los ltimos quince d as l ha insistido ese tema
619015 si alguien ha sido causante del malestar en la udeg es el mismo rector general ha provocado a lo largo de un a o un clima de inconformidad
619016 se necesita m s una universidad de licenciatura y de posgrado que una de preparatorias
619017 mi abogado ya est preparando una demanda por espionaje para pedir la intervenci n de las autoridades y que se penalice a quienes hayan cometido ese acto delictivo tambi n voy a recurrir a las instancias del gobierno para que busquen a los responsables y se aplique la normativa
619018 una vez que lleg al cargo la verdad s nos mostramos sorprendidos con la actuaci n de carlos brise o ahora lo estamos conociendo antes era p blica su sumisi n a ra l padilla y ahora habla hasta de caciques
619019 en realidad estuvimos trabajando en el c digo urbano sobre este proyecto nosotros nunca opinamos que se vetara el c digo urbano como dijo el rector general porque nosotros participamos en su creaci n y modificaci n
619020 el planteamiento es al rev s ahora se busca que se sepa con anticipaci n cuando vas a presupuestar un peso a qu se va a destinar si lo que necesitamos son preparatorias que todos le metamos dinero a preparatorias si en el plan estatal de desarrollo nos hablan que tenemos que garantizar la educaci n media superior para el 2030 se debe revisar qu estamos haciendo cu les son las metas y qu necesita la udeg
619021 no que despu s sea otro el destino que se da a los recursos
619022 luego nos enteramos que se us dinero para el proyecto de la universidad en los ngeles

619046 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
619047 in the passing game well use him everywhere possible as a deep threat as a short threat as a crossing threat watching him out there hes really comfortable with himself and weve got to be careful not to overload him and take away from what hes there for and what he does really well which is running the football
619048 what well do with him is try to take advantage of his speed and maybe like theyve done in the past well try and get him down the field and more or less like a wide receiver move him out and move him around at first it was so different for him but hes really adapted very well to it
619049 the coaching staff has been great to me coach george warhop has been very enthusiastic
619050 in the last 10 years football in mexico has really come a long way
619051 i can give you what happened today but i cant give you whatll happen tomorrow
619052 it really helps you to teach your quarterbacks to understand the physics of it
619053 the balance the lines of force the kinetic energy and all that kind of stuff it really does help you streamline their techniques and make them most efficient youre not just repeating what somebody taught you years ago
619054 wed throw the ball 60 times but youd look up at the end and see that the running back still had 130 to 140 yards
619055 darryl knew his strength was the passing game and i really admired his guts to throw the football
619056 we would run sometimes out of the i formation but a lot of the time that was just to set up another pass
619057 i said wait a minute he was at san jose state at the same time i was
619058 you have to remember mike wasnt left on his own to be a genius but when he had the opportunity he showed everything youd want in a coach
619059 its very very very very structured and rigid and thats the only way this thing works
619060 the quarterbacks dont have the option to throw it deep middle or check its not a judgment of what they want to do its a reaction of what the defense has taken away thats how we do it
619061 the demand supply equilibrium in the real estate sector is likely to be skewed as retail investors begin to defer their investment decisions although demand has begun to wane it has still not affected prices to any significant degree but several real estate and housing companies have begun to offer incentives to customers to book their homes and apartments
619062 as the price rise in the real estate sector seems to have eased off and interest rates are at their highs it makes better sense to wait and watch before entering the market there is a distinct possibility that interest rates are likely to tumble in the coming months free foreign trips and cars apart there is also a distinct possibility of real estate prices weakening in the months ahead
619063 the demand might have waned marginally in the recent past but we are nowhere at the end of the road as far as housing demand is concerned the speculators have been getting out of the market and it is the genuine retail investor that is left in the market and that is a good thing
619064 moreover the rainy season has never been the peak period for the real estate industry in the country we expect demand to pick up once again with the festive season in a couple of months time from now by that time the inflationary spiral and interest rate regime are expected to come down from their present highs

619082 allah does not accept prayer of anyone of you if he does hadath passes wind till he performs the ablution anew
619083 o allahs apostle tell me what allah has enjoined on me as regards prayers
619084 you have to offer perfectly the five compulsory prayers in a day and a night 24 hrs except if you want to perform some extra optional prayers
619085 tell me what allah has enjoined on me as regards fasting
619086 you have to observe fast during the month of ramadan except if you fast some extra optional fast
619087 tell me what allah has enjoined on me as regard zakat
619088 by him who has honored you i will not perform any optional deeds of worship and i will not leave anything of what allah has enjoined on me
619089 he will be successful if he has told the truth or he will enter paradise if he said the truth
619090 the zakat for one hundred and twenty camels is two hiqqas and if the zakat payer slaughters the camels intentionally or gives them as a present or plays some other trick in order to avoid the zakat then there is no harm in it for him
619091 on the day of resurrection the kanz treasure or wealth of which zakat has not been paid of anyone of you will appear in the shape of a huge bald headed poisonous male snake and its owner will run away from it but it will follow him and say i am your kanz
619092 by allah that snake will keep on following him until he stretches out his hand and let the snake swallow it
619093 if the owner of camels does not pay their zakat then on the day of resurrection those camels will come to him and will strike his face with their hooves
619094 if one pays zakat of his camels one day or one year prior to the end of the year by the end of which zakat becomes due his zakat will be valid
619095 if the number of camels reaches twenty then their owner has to pay four sheep as zakat and if their owner gives them as a gift or sells them in order to escape the payment of zakat cunningly before the completion of a year then he is not to pay anything and if he slaughters them and then dies then no zakat is to be taken from his property
619096 it is to marry the daughter of a man and marry ones daughter to that man at the same time without mahr in both cases or to marry the sister of a man and marry ones own sister to that man without mahr
619097 if one by a trick marries on the basis of shighar the marriage is valid but its condition is illegal
619098 the muta and the shighar are permissible but the condition is illegal
619099 allahs apostle forbade the muta marriage on the day of the battle of khaibar and he forbade the eating of donkeys meat
619100 if one by a tricky way marries temporarily his marriage is illegal
619101 one should not prevent others from watering their animals with the surplus of his water in order to prevent them from benefiting by the surplus of grass
619102 it is about an orphan girl under the custody of her guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with mahr less than other women of her status
619103 for every betrayer there will be a flag by which he will be recognized on the day of resurrection
619104 i am only a human being and you people have disputes may be some one amongst you can present his case in a more eloquent and convincing manner than the other and i give my judgment in his favor according to what i hear beware if ever i give by error somebody something of his brothers right then he should not take it as i have only given him a piece of fire
619105 a virgin should not be married till she is asked for her consent and the matron should not be married till she is asked whether she agrees to marry or not
619106 o allahs apostle how will she the virgin express her consent
619107 if a virgin is not asked for her consent and she is not married and then a man by playing a trick presents two false witnesses that he has married her with her consent and the judge confirms his marriage as a true one and the husband knows that the witnesses were false ones then there is no harm for him to consummate his marriage with her and the marriage is regarded as valid
619108 dont be afraid for khansa bint khidam was given by her father in marriage against her will then the prophet cancelled that marriage
619109 a lady slave should not be given in marriage until she is consulted and a virgin should not be given in marriage until her permission is granted
619110 if a man by playing a trick presents two false witnesses before the judge to testify that he has married a matron with her consent and the judge confirms his marriage and the husband is sure that he has never married her before then such a marriage will be considered as a legal one and he may live with her as husband
619111 it is essential to have the consent of a virgin for the marriage
619112 if a man falls in love with an orphan slave girl or a virgin and she refuses him and then he makes a trick by bringing two false witnesses to testify that he has married her and then she attains the age of puberty and agrees to marry him and the judge accepts the false witness and the husband knows that the witnesses were false ones he may consummate his marriage
619113 a woman from her tribe gave her a leather skin containing honey as a present and she gave some of it to allahs apostle to drink
619114 when he enters upon you he will come near to you whereupon you should say to him o allahs apostle have you eaten maghafir he will say no then you say to him what is this bad smell and it would be very hard on allahs apostle that a bad smell should be found on his body he will say hafsa has given me a drink of honey then you should say to him its bees must have sucked from the al urfut a foul smelling flower i too will tell him the same and you o saifya say the same
619115 by him except whom none has the right to be worshipped i was about to say to him what you had told me to say while he was still at the gate because of fear from you
619116 when he entered upon me i told him the same as that and when he entered upon safiya she too told him the same
619117 o allahs apostle shall i give you a drink of it honey
619118 if you hear the news of an outbreak of an epidemic plague in a certain place do not enter that place and if the epidemic falls in a place while you are present in it do not leave that place to escape from the epidemic
619119 allahs apostle mentioned the plague and said it is a means of punishment with which some nations were punished and some of it has remained and it appears now and then so whoever hears that there is an outbreak of plague in some land he should not go to that land and if the plague breaks out in the land where one is already present one should not run away from that land escaping from the plague
619120 the one who takes back his gift is like a dog swallowing its own vomit and we believers should not act according to this bad example
619121 if someone wants to buy a house and being afraid that the neighbor of the house may buy it through preemption he buys one share out of one hundred shares of the house and then buys the rest of the house then the neighbor can only have the right of preemption for the first share but not for the rest of the house and the buyer may play such a trick in this case
619122 wont you order this i e sad to buy my house which is in my yard
619123 i will not offer more than four hundred in installments over a fixed period
619124 i was offered five hundred cash but i refused had i not heard the prophet saying a neighbor is more entitled to receive the care of his neighbor i would not have sold it to you
619125 if someone wants to sell a house and deprived somebody of the right of preemption he has the right to play a trick to render the preemption invalid and that is by giving the house to the buyer as a present and marking its boundaries and giving it to him the buyer then gives the seller one thousand dirham as compensation in which case the preemptor loses his right of preemption
619126 if i had not heard allahs apostle saying a neighbor has more right to be taken care of by his neighbor then i would not have given it to you
619127 if one has bought a portion of a house and wants to cancel the right of preemption he may give it as a present to his little son and he will not be obliged to take an oath
619128 why didnt you stay in your fathers and mothers house to see whether you will be given gifts or not if you are telling the truth
619129 the neighbor has more right to be taken care of by his neighbor than anyone else
619130 if one wants to buy a house for 20 000 dirhams then there is no harm to play a trick to deprive somebody of preemption by buying it just on paper with 20 000 dirhams but paying to the seller only 9 999 dirhams in cash and then agree with the seller to pay only one dinar in cash for the rest of the price i
619131 so that man allows some people the playing of tricks amongst the muslims although the prophet said in dealing with muslims one should not sell them sick animals or bad things or stolen things
619132 if i had not heard the prophet saying the neighbor has more right to be taken care of by his neighbor than anyone else then i would not have sold it to you

619150 the only thing i thought about that was when they had a guy on second maybe they had an idea of what i was throwing they were leaning out over the plate when i was going to throw outside
619151 the first one i was just getting familiar with the mound again
619152 the second one i tried to piece it together as if it was a one run game i was able to throw my sinker and off speed pitches for strikes
619153 it was a coincidence that they were sold not done because of the illness as it turned out the timing was right considering the economy there was a recession down there we also had a body shop and that business was really slow you had people who couldnt pay their mortgage they werent going to pay to get their cars fixed

619258 god is dead but science can guide our good judgment to even greater ends
619259 why does not the pope empty purgatory for the sake of holy love and of the dire need of the souls that are there if he redeems an infinite number of souls for the sake of miserable money with which to build a church the former reasons would be most just the latter is most trivial
619260 why are mortuary and anniversary masses for the dead continued and why does he not return or permit the withdrawal of the endowments founded on their behalf since it is wrong to pray for the redeemed
619261 what is this new piety of god and the pope that for money they allow a man who is impious and their enemy to buy out of purgatory the pious soul of a friend of god and do not rather because of that pious and beloved souls own need free it for pure loves sake
619262 why are the penitential canons long since in actual fact and through disuse abrogated and dead now satisfied by the granting of indulgences as though they were still alive and in force
619263 why does not the pope whose wealth is to day greater than the riches of the richest build just this one church of st peter with his own money rather than with the money of poor believers
619264 what is it that the pope remits and what participation does he grant to those who by perfect contrition have a right to full remission and participation
619265 what greater blessing could come to the church than if the pope were to do a hundred times a day what he now does once and bestow on every believer these remissions and participations
619266 since the pope by his pardons seeks the salvation of souls rather than money why does he suspend the indulgences and pardons granted heretofore since these have equal efficacy

619279 before yom kippur the butcher would arrive and i would go to my room and hide under the covers in order to not hear the cries of the chickens
619280 next to my house in jerusalem there are chicken cages scattered around without water she tells the chickens are brought to the slaughter in cramped cages without water in the broiling sun
619281 unfortunately i think that it will be very hard to eradicate this custom in the ultra orthodox community
619282 troubled him greatly one night in a dream he saw that they were lifting him up to the supernal worlds taking him into ever more recondite chambers until he could no longer see due to the great supernal illumination and had to shut his eyes finally they brought him to one inner chamber and said to him open your eyes he opened them and beheld many great sages and tzaddikim sitting and studying torah with the baal shem tov sitting at the head of them all the baal shem tov said to him why are you having so much trouble understanding the tosephos the answer is as follows when the scholar awoke in the morning he took his gemara and looked over the words of the tosephos he saw that the baal shem tovs answer was remarkably clear nevertheless he still thought that it was only a dream when the holy shabbos arrived he went to the third meal2 of the baal shem tov as soon as he walked into the house the baal shem tov said to him welcome did you look over explanation of the tosephos that i told you to see if it is true from that day on he attended to the baal shem tov and became a great chasid i heard this from honest individuals kesser shem tov 2 p 16a

619284 copied from http www uga edu islam 11naqsprin html which the author copied from the haqqani foundation and added a few helpful notes which ive left intact
619285 from what i gather to be the online home of the descendants of the khwajagan masters usually associated with the naqshbandi order http www
619286 the aim in dhikr is that the heart be always aware of al haqq the truth a beautiful name of allah for its practice banished inattention
619287 my god you are my goal and your satisfaction is my aim
619288 verily the good deeds of the righteous are the iniquities of those who are near to god
619289 every breath which is exhaled from within must be exhaled with awareness and presence of mind and so that the mind does not stray into forgetfulness
619290 the foundation of our work is in the breath the more that one is able to be conscious of ones breathing the stronger is ones inner life it is a must for everyone to safeguard his breath in the time of his inhalation and exhalation and further to safeguard his breath in the interval between the inhalation and exhalation
619291 hush dar dam is moving from breath to breath so there is no heedlessness but rather there is presence and with each breath that we take should be the remembrance of the real
619292 dhikr remembrance of god in the breath is flowing in the body of every single living creature by the necessity of their breath even without will as a sign of obedience which is part of their creation through their breathing the sound of the letter ha of the divine name allah is made with every exhalation and inhalation and it is a sign of the unseen essence serving to emphasize the uniqueness of god therefore it is necessary to be present with that breathing in order to realize the essence of the creator
619293 for the early thinkers the soul was visualized sensuously as a breath body
619294 looking upon the steps means that the seeker in coming and going looks upon the top of his feet and thereby his attention is not scattered by looking at what he should not look at
619295 nazar bar qadam may be alluding to the seekers traveling through the stages of breaking from existence and putting behind self love
619296 the journey home refers to that traveling which the seeker makes within his human nature in other words travel from the qualities of humankind toward the angelic qualities moving from blameworthy qualities to laudable ones
619297 this blessed expression traveling in the homeland means traveling within the self the source of its results lies in putting the final practice at the beginning which is one of the characteristics of the naqshbandi way and although this inner traveling can also be found in other tariqas schools of sufism in those it is found only in the end after the traveling of the horizons referring to the quranic verse 41 53 we will show them our signs on the horizons and within their selves until they know he is the real
619298 retreat within the crowd is that state when one is so constantly and completely absorbed in divine remembrance that one could walk through the market place without hearing a word
619299 i have two sides one faces my creator and one faces creation
619300 close the door of the formality of sheikhhood open the door of friendship close the door of khalwat solitary retreat and open the door of sohbat companionship
619301 our path is in companionship in physical retreat there comes fame and with fame comes calamity our welfare lies with the assembly and its companionship on condition that self negation is found in one another
619302 since with your presence there is neither audible dhikr nor voyaging nor audition of special music and poetry what is your path
619303 the pure words of the tribe of abd ul khaliq ghujduwani which are retreat within the crowd and we follow in their way
619304 outwardly to be with the people while inwardly to be with god
619305 men whom neither business nor profit distracts from the recollection of allah
619306 retreat within the crowd is derived from traveling in the homeland since if traveling in the homeland is properly accomplished then retreat within the crowd will properly occur the seeker within the diversity of the crowd travels in his own land and the diversity of the horizons finds no way into the meditation cell of his inner self this treasure will manifest with difficulty at the beginning and with no difficulty in the end and in this tariqa it is the portion of the beginning while in other paths it is at the end this is so because the treasure is derived from traveling within the self with presence in the moment which is at the beginning of this path while traveling on the horizons takes place simultaneously this is the opposite of the other paths which make the traveling on the horizons the beginning and the traveling within the self the end
619307 perfection is not in exhibitions of miraculous powers but perfection is to sit among people sell and buy marry and have children and yet never leave the presence of allah even for one moment
619308 the real meaning of dhikr is inward awareness of god the purpose of dhikr is to attain this consciousness
619309 at the first stage one recites the name of god with ones tongue then when the heart becomes alive one recites inwardly at the beginning one should declare in words what one remembers then stage by stage the remembrance spreads throughout ones being descending to the heart then rising to the soul then still further it reaches the realm of the secrets further to the hidden to the most hidden of the hidden
619310 we did not remember you as you deserve to be remembered o allah
619311 when i reached him i saw that his remembering of me preceded my remembrance of him
619312 beloved you and your approval are my purpose and desire
619313 the seeker must for one hour or two or whatever he is capable of hold onto his mind and prevent thoughts of other than god entering
619314 nigah dasht is the guarding of the special awareness and presence which have resulted from the noble dhikr so that remembering of anything other than the real does not find its way into the heart mind
619315 nigah dasht is when the seeker at the time of the dhikr holds his heart mind upon the meaning of la ilaha illa llah so that thoughts do not find entrance into his heart because if thoughts are in the mind then the result of the dhikr meaning presence of the heart mind will not manifest
619316 nigah dasht is an expression meaning the prevention of the occurance of thought at the time one is occupied with repeating the fragrant sentence of la ilaha illa llah
619317 the meaning of preserving the mind from thoughts is not that the seeker can avoid thoughts at the beginning of his attempts but rather that thoughts do not disturb the attendance and presence required for the dhikr
619318 it isnt so that thoughts never enter the heart mind but rather that at times they do and at times they do not
619319 succeeding with thoughts is difficult or even impossible i preserved my heart for twenty years from thoughts after which they would still appear but they then found no hold there
619320 the complete experience of divine contemplation achieved through the action of objective love
619321 some have said that this is a perceiving witnessing which is the domination of witnessing the real in the heart through essential love
619322 yad dasht is an expression meaning the durability of the awareness of the glorious real
619323 yad dasht is that which the dhakir person practicing dhikr during the dhikr maintains fully the meaning of negation and affirmation in his heart in the presence of the named
619324 yad kard remembrance refers to the work of invoking remembering
619325 wuquf i zamani is the work of the traveler on the way to be attentive of his state and to know whether it is a cause for giving thanks or for repenting to give thanks while feeling spiritual elation and to repent while in spiritual dryness or contraction
619326 the foundation of the work of the seeker has been established in the awareness of time exercise as seeing at each moment whether the perceiver of breaths is breathing with presence or with forgetfulness
619327 khwaja naqshband instructed that in the state of qabz contraction one should seek gods forgiveness whereas in the state of bast expansion one should offer thanks close observation of these two states constitutes wuquf i zamani
619328 wuquf i zamani is a term meaning the keeping account of the times one passes in a state of dispersal tafriqah or collectedness jamiyyat
619329 wuquf i adadi is the observation of the number of dhikrs and of whether this observation yields results or not
619330 the observation of the number of repetitions of the dhikr of the heart is for gathering thoughts mental activity which are scattered
619331 the important thing is not the number of repetitions but rather the composure and awareness with which one makes them
619332 wuquf i qalbi is an expression meaning an awareness and presence of heart toward the most high real felt in such a manner that the heart feels no need of anything except the real
619333 the observance of wuquf i qalbi the most important and necessary because it is the summary and essence of the intention of the dhikr
619334 dont eh me i know you have perfectly good ears

619336 its my life long dream to become a super cool kickass ninja

619340 my mother used to love it her and my father we used to watch them together
619341 hey dont go looking like that i didnt mean you were really interrupting me or anything
619342 you never really talk about that sort of thing so i was surprised thats all and flattered too
619343 ill just ask fai to teach me magic and make me a vampire
619344 and then i can turn you into a vampire while you sleep and plague you for all eternity until you finally train me and we can be vampire ninjas together hahaha
619345 you know maybe you arent so ninja like after all you couldnt even guard against my super duper happy happy joy joy jump jump secret jump glomp attack
619346 i think that was a record breaking speed for how fast a person can go from your shade of pale to tomato red
619347 calm down or else youre going to turn purple next
619348 thats your problem you over think things you keep looking for something wrong or how something can go wrong five steps ahead of a disaster that may never happen only sets yourself up for disasters you werent looking out for
619349 then whatever you do dont let me get that far ahead of myself
619350 idiot why do you look like youre about to cry
619351 im being stupid i know i just its just that i never thought someone like you would like someone like me and i i guess i
619352 none of that matters now right so just drop it

619358 when i was thinking crimes of passion i wasnt thinking tha
619359 i do believe that i woke up the entire neighborhood i say that because certain individuals scurried out of their bedrooms to see just what in the hell was happening in dads domain
619360 i am not challenging mr liberals patriotism i am challenging his point of view
619361 its exciting and ill have time to enjoy personal accolades in the offseason but what were doing right now as a team is a little more exciting
619362 i think manny could hit in a lineup by himself
619363 david ortiz needs manny more than manny needs david ortiz david and i have always been very close but david knows that manny helped him see much better pitches david is a great hitter but he needs protection manny doesnt thats how good he is
619364 no not at all especially with don mattingly whos very well respected and respects the players
619365 hell respect what manny brings and hell use him as an example to the younger hitters because i truly believe that all hitters benefit by watching how he goes about hitting a baseball
619366 when hes going well reinforce to him the things hes doing so well and when he isnt go study some video with him and point out what you think he might be doing wrong with his swing
619367 hes an incredible student of hitting he sees things from a viewpoint that sometimes he can only see but in the new league he shouldnt have a problem because there are guys im sure hes seen before
619368 i think the game has changed from the standpoint that shortstops when they come into the game now theyre expected to present a lot more offense
619369 omar vizquel probably still playing and here again i think its an example of when a guy is given the opportunity it shows that he can play well beyond 40 what happens when you turn 32 33 in this game you start being introduced as 32 year old 35 year old it becomes a part of your name where it didnt matter before but theres sort of a brainwashing that takes place and if youre not careful if youre not strong mentally then you fall into that but i think that as you have seen guys that are 40 years old and given the opportunity prove that you can play well beyond 40 if theyre guys that are taking care of themselves
619370 certainly i think that he has certainly put himself in a position i think that guys like myself have probably made it a little bit hopefully a little bit easier paved the way a little bit and it forces people to look at guys like that a little bit harder than they otherwise would for a long time this was always reserved for the big guys who hit the ball out of the ballpark and i think people are now starting to realize that there are a lot more facets to the game other than just offense
619371 moss might be the most impactful major leaguer they got they got upper level prospects but no one of major impact hansen has a good arm laroche has good power but i dont like him defensively and he wont hit enough
619372 i think for the players they traded they didnt get enough impact back
619373 i think there are going to be a lot of blocks this year
619374 i think there are too many teams who feel they are still in the race to allow relievers or starters to pass through without taking a good long look its still early in the process so maybe as teams fall out there will be fewer teams to worry about
619375 there will be teams putting guys with big contracts out there
619376 there may be a team or two that bites on them
619377 im sure it was a no brainer for the yankees for at some point i think they knew that kyle farnsworth as well as hes pitched would become kyle farnsworth
619378 i feel the range is getting better i just love playing and being out on the field ill play anywhere ive moved to first and to third base before but you know i enjoy playing shortstop again
619379 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
619380 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform

619398 im so moved its been a long wait even if we have to wait for hours it is worthwhile
619399 the torch represents peace and harmony the olympic spirit will give us strength to rebuild
619400 theres a lot of glory in having the torch come here this is our way of showing our support
619401 we have had so much sadness buried deep within us
619402 the torch relay will help it all burst from within us and dissipate
619403 let the dust settle because emotions always run high after defeats like this
619404 its the first time i have ever lost back to back games and i am more gutted than anyone because midway through the day i expected us to bowl them out for 200 and win quite comfortably
619405 let the dust settle from today and try to work out where we are
619406 we are not playing the level of cricket which i would like i cant fault any of the efforts from any of the players they are giving it absolutely everything but we are just not playing well enough as a unit or as well as we can and that has to be looked at
619407 there are a lot of us who have to look at the batting and say we are not performing to the standard we would expect
619408 i have no doubts about my captaincy ability absolutely none
619409 but i am not scoring runs as a number three batsman i have got to score runs and in this series what have i got
619410 i have had some good balls a little bit of bad luck but i set myself a lot of high standards and in this series i have not got anywhere near those standards so i want to look at that and make sure i get back to playing like i can
619411 you have to deliver out in the middle i am an experienced player and at the minute i am not delivering so i will have to come up with a formula to give myself the best chance to deliver when the pressure is on
619412 it was a real bitter blow that because when we had that partnership between collingwood and sidebottom to get us up to 280 i put us as favourites to win the game
619413 but it was a very special innings from graeme smith the way he came out and played and chased down that target was as good an innings as i have ever seen under that sort of pressure
619414 we threw everything at them we had that flurry of wickets in the afternoon and we just felt we were going to get wickets consistently and blow them away even in the last hour i thought we were one wicket away
619415 since readmission we have targeted wins in australia india and england we have ticked off one of them and that is something we really wanted to do
619416 i guess we would wish we could be back home to share it with everyone as we know it means so much to people for us this was bigger than just a cricket game
619417 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap

619423 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
619424 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
619425 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
619426 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
619427 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
619428 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
619429 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
619430 does frankf38 know anything at all about cars or energy
619431 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
619432 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
619433 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
619434 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
619435 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
619436 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
619437 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
619438 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
619439 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure

619441 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
619442 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
619443 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
619444 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
619445 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
619446 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
619447 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
619448 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
619449 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
619450 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
619451 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
619452 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
619453 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
619454 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
619455 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
619456 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
619457 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
619458 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
619459 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
619460 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
619461 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
619462 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
619463 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
619464 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
619465 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
619466 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
619467 yes i am and more than once youre going to love it
619468 okay only one more step and were ready to start
619469 my god john shes so fucking wet this thing just slips right in
619470 okay john pull up a chair and lets start the show
619471 now raise up on your tiptoes and stay there until i tell you youll see what
619472 well it gets even better thats a three speed vibrator you just felt low after 30 seconds it goes to medium after a minute it goes to high and then stays there by the way you have to have both heels off the ground in order to be in pleasure mode
619473 if that was all there was to it youd be a very happy girl but as im sure youve figured out there is more
619474 every time you come down off your toes you are in non pleasure mode as soon as the pedals are depressed those leads on you tits clit and the probe up your ass will deliver an electric shock trust me it isnt too bad lets have you feel that now ready
619475 see not too bad but there is always a catch isnt there the catch here is that if you keep the pedals down 15 seconds after the first shock there is another one and every 15 seconds after that another one still plus each successive one is stronger and longer than the one before unlike the vibrator this doesnt only have three levels it has six after the sixth one you just keep getting that one every 15 seconds but believe me you dont even want to feel that one once
619476 okay should be clear now how the game works two more things to tell you and well start first the game goes until you cum three times after that you can stop whenever you want or keep going as long as you want
619477 second since the only way to modify this whole rig is to reprogram it something i cant do easily you have to give up your slowdown safe word you can keep your stop safe word but if you use it john wont get the rest of his training you will lose the rest of this lovely weekend and i will be summarily pissed off at you
619478 take a couple of deep breaths and then up you go
619479 some sound advice laura dont come down the first time until you cum at least once your legs will get pretty tired soon enough
619480 pretty entertaining huh john look at the slut trying to fuck that dildo
619481 im flabbergasted scott this device in unbelievable and youre right this is an incredible sight
619482 hmm i guess i forgot to tell you that it takes a full thirty seconds to reset the shock sequence if you go up and back down in less than thirty seconds the original cycle just keeps going
619483 john i promise this wont hurt her and believe me she can take this you are going to see her cum like never before by the time were done here trust me
619484 my god did you see that john the slut just wouldnt let the vibrator shut off until she was done i dont believe what i just saw
619485 fuck oh god scott please please i cant finish this please stop
619486 please please dont do this dont make me use my safe word please
619487 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
619488 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
619489 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
619490 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
619491 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
619492 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
619493 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
619494 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
619495 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
619496 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
619497 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
619498 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
619499 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
619500 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
619501 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
619502 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
619503 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
619504 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
619505 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
619506 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
619507 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
619508 it was made into a bad movie in the 1970s starring the admirable george c scott
619509 but i have always been convinced that theres a great movie in this book and this is the one we are going to make
619510 i said from the start if we got the boat right then the rest would fit into place it has to go from being a fishing boat in the first half of the film to a war vessel in the second half it was vital to me that it was genuinely built before the second world war so the hunt was on from the moment we got the go ahead for the movie
619511 its a 38ft american motor cabin cruiser a wooden hull 11 ft beam 3 ft draught a perfect match to the boat hemingway described
619512 it used to have a four cylinder flathead chrysler diesel engine but someone replaced it with a v8 general motors gasoline car engine it turned the boat into a virtual bomb it looked like a bucket of rusty bolts so i sent some guys to move it to a good boatyard
619513 it was 12 knots on a boat which was not seaworthy after a nine hour journey we navigated in by torchlight to the new yard
619514 we will then take her to an undisclosed location and protect her like an unborn child
619515 but it means that you will see 27m of the 32m on the screen there are certain things that are meant to be and if youre lucky enough in life to eventually get there then that is a great achievement this is the project that is meant to be for me
619516 i put a lot of myself in to those roles
619517 in the valley of elah was an important film because we were looking at how the iraq war impacts on local communities across america with the loss of family members its a tragedy that carries on
619518 he is so focused tommy never wants to waste time and sometimes we were having a bit too much fun for him
619519 my belief is that we should never waste a day
619520 and when you are working and acting is our work there should be total concentration on what you are trying to achieve anything less than that then you are cheating yourself and short changing others
619521 in the end i didnt think i could make it as a professional sportsman so i thought that acting could make a great alternative life
619522 its still sport of a kind with winners and losers you also have to be fit to survive its not that first or second part or even big role which is so difficult its maintaining it over years
619523 no im a private person i hate everything about this business that intrudes on my life including these interviews but i do them to promote the movies because it helps people im fond of
619524 there is a terrific battle between an 11 year old boy and a 1 000lb blue marlin which i am looking forward to filming that is when the boat comes into its own
619525 this movie might be set in the past but it is about you and me now
619526 it is not a chick flick not a thriller killer not a quirky romance
619527 i want it to be a really good movie exciting from minute to minute frame to frame this is for people who want to see something different
619528 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
619529 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
619530 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
619531 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
619532 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
619533 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
619534 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
619535 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
619536 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
619537 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
619538 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
619539 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
619540 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
619541 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
619542 there is not much that evangelicals have in common with the policies promoted by barack obama
619543 despite his best efforts to court people of faith voters understand the difference between lip service and public service and john mccains record is much more in line with the values of the evangelical community
619544 one thing that it clearly is indicative of this poll is that this nation cares about the christian values and ethics of a candidate for national office and it makes enough difference that the news media reports on it
619545 people of faith have always been involved in the political process they have a patriotic and scriptural obligation to do so it is to be ignored at the candidates peril
619546 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
619547 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
619548 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
619549 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
619550 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
619551 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
619552 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
619553 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
619554 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote
619555 cleve youre wrong chet was back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he answered his answer just wasnt heard
619556 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
619557 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
619558 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
619559 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
619560 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
619561 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
619562 ive always said this document and the holy bible theyve been all the guidance i need
619563 much to be thankful for theres not much i wouldnt do over
619564 we just ask that in the end gods grace shines upon us
619565 he said and taking one hand to steady the other he slowly scratched his name on the gift thank you senator byrd http my barackobama com page community post jefferyfloyd ggbfbb aug 2 2008 at 8 50 pm
619566 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
619567 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
619568 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
619569 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
619570 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
619571 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
619572 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
619573 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
619574 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
619575 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
619576 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
619577 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
619578 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
619579 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
619580 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
619581 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
619582 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
619583 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
619584 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
619585 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
619586 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
619587 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
619588 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
619589 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
619590 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
619591 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
619592 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
619593 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
619594 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
619595 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
619596 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
619597 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
619598 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
619599 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
619600 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
619601 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
619602 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
619603 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
619604 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
619605 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
619606 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
619607 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
619608 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
619609 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
619610 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
619611 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
619612 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
619613 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
619614 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
619615 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
619616 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
619617 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
619618 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
619619 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
619620 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
619621 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
619622 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
619623 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
619624 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
619625 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
619626 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
619627 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
619628 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
619629 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
619630 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
619631 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
619632 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
619633 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
619634 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
619635 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
619636 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
619637 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
619638 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
619639 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
619640 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
619641 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
619642 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
619643 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
619644 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
619645 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
619646 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
619647 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
619648 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
619649 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
619650 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
619651 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
619652 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
619653 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
619654 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
619655 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
619656 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
619657 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
619658 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
619659 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
619660 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
619661 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
619662 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
619663 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas

619667 no as the real killers sivarasan suba and dhanu were already dead
619668 the real reason behind the meeting is still to be revealed by priyanka
619669 the meeting is unique there is no comparison in the world history priyanka and nalini do not know each other prior to the meeting it is unexpected for a daughter of a victim in a gruesome murder to meet an accused who had been sentenced with death penalty later on converted to sentence for life
619670 whatever may me the reason for not coming out with real reason for meeting the courage and the generosity of priyanka should be appreciated the outcome of the meeting in no way helps nalini
619671 there is no vacancy for the post of the prime minister no applications are being invited or are necessary or are being entertained
619672 just like a chief minister who leads the party successfully in the elections becomes the future chief minister ditto is the case with the prime minister

619680 acab de cenar dijo que sal a un momento a buscar una tarjeta de visita y ya no volvi
619681 es wartet ein sehr wichtiges spiel auf uns denn es geht um die tabellenf hrung und platz eins ist unser gro es ziel
619682 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
619683 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
619684 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
619685 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
619686 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
619687 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
619688 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
619689 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
619690 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
619691 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
619692 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
619693 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
619694 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
619695 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
619696 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
619697 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
619698 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
619699 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
619700 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
619701 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
619702 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
619703 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
619704 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
619705 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
619706 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
619707 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
619708 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
619709 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
619710 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
619711 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
619712 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
619713 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
619714 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
619715 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
619716 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
619717 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
619718 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
619719 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
619720 those ads really were focused on two things they were focused on the fact that sen obama wants to raise taxes and im opposed of it and he opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling so the message there is therere stark differences between myself and sen obama
619721 i think we should be in a post racial environment
619722 i think sen barack obama has done an admirable job of that i dont think he has race baited i think he has been very good about that
619723 the presumptive republican nominee has embarked on a bare knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling mr obama
619724 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
619725 sitting at home in his mothers basement and ranting into the ether between games of dungeons amp dragons
619726 sen john mccain of arizona is the only republican who promises to end the george bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
619727 mccain is still i think upset about the op ed not being printed
619728 a lot of the maverick positioning is now turning into more conservative positioning and some of that includes not being afraid to go negative not being afraid to call a liberal a liberal and not being afraid to go after a newspaper
619729 latte drinking sushi eating volvo driving new york times reading
619730 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances
619731 for starters their editorials are decidedly liberal thats a no brainer and there are often complaints that even their general reporting is biased in subtle and not so subtle ways the new york times has come to be associated with the northeast liberal establishment
619732 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
619733 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
619734 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
619735 ive never wanted to do anything remotely close to doping its never ever crossed my mind ive never been approached about doing it its never been an issue my entire career its the last thing i would ever do
619736 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
619737 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
619738 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
619739 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
619740 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
619741 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
619742 everybodys trying to figure out how to lower levels of acrylamide without significantly adversely affecting taste
619743 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
619744 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
619745 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
619746 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
619747 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
619748 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
619749 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
619750 unsere leute im basislager haben den tod von zwei nepalesen zwei koreanern und einem pakistanischen tr ger best tigt
619751 its a very very humbling experience because it is a recognition by your peers who know the work that it takes to be a superior court judge
619752 based on your knowledge what do you think of these candidates experience on these 10 different questions
619753 you try and get an honest opinion from people that know and people who have experience with them but there is always the popularity contest out there
619754 the people that are really interested are going to ask lawyers what they know what do you think about this what do you think about that and they probably will get a more candid opinion than they will from the bar poll
619755 i just dont understand how most attorneys can actively gauge a judges work ethic other than timeliness of judges decisions and you can talk to anybody who knows me and they will say that personally and professionally my work ethic is good
619756 i dont think its accurate with regard to myself i didnt really look at what it did with the other candidates
619757 i got a general feeling that it basically said everybody is qualified
619758 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
619759 we are borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
619760 i for one do not believe our country can withstand 10 more years of the status quo
619761 we need to change the debate in this country from what we cant do to what we can america has led every major technological shift in the last 100 years and we can lead the next one as well the problem is not technology it is political will
619762 mr gore has moved a long way from the solutions recommended in
619763 we couldnt come close to his goal of producing all our electricity from solar wind and geothermal energy in 10 years without coercive even authoritarian government
619764 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
619765 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
619766 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
619767 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
619768 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
619769 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
619770 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
619771 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
619772 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
619773 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
619774 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
619775 you know its not about you its about your country
619776 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
619777 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
619778 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
619779 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
619780 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
619781 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
619782 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
619783 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
619784 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
619785 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
619786 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
619787 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
619788 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
619789 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
619790 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
619791 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
619792 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
619793 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
619794 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
619795 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
619796 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
619797 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
619798 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
619799 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
619800 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
619801 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
619802 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
619803 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
619804 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
619805 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
619806 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
619807 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
619808 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
619809 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
619810 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
619811 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
619812 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
619813 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
619814 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
619815 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
619816 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
619817 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
619818 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
619819 aber ich denke es ist umsichtig und weise mit einer mannschaft von experten eine reihe von fragen zu berpr fen

619822 the credit crunch is really hitting the workforce hard and many employees are seeking a wage increase to soften the effect
619823 the rising cost of food and the increase in the basic cost of living has really affected employees
619824 i will maintain that i will look anyone in the eye and state i have not killed
619825 i walked with her for a bit and from her perspective maybe it was unwanted attention
619826 but she didnt make that clear it didnt seem like she was telling me to go away if shed told me to leave id have done so straight away
619827 that was at 12 33pm i know because just a minute before id made a call from my mobile to check how much credit i had left
619828 i know i have done wrong in the past and if i could go back in time and change that i would

619832 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
619833 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
619834 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real

619839 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
619840 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
619841 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
619842 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
619843 los que est ocurriendo es que en las negociaciones que se est n haciendo en estados unidos est n apareciendo penas muy irrisorias que no corresponden a la peligrosidad ni a los delitos que se han cometido por los delincuentes con los que negocian
619844 vamos a mirar vamos a hablar con estados unidos pero si queremos que as como hay una pena m xima que la establecen las leyes colombianas que haya una pena m nima para que entonces los delincuentes no est n ahora prefiriendo que los extraditen porque les va mucho mejor en las negociaciones en ese pa s
619845 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
619846 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
619847 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
619848 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
619849 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
619850 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
619851 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
619852 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously

619854 hey someone stole my tire im going to be late
619855 its not an emergency but id like to talk to the police my tire was stolen
619856 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
619857 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand

619903 three sources familiar with the investigation said the case soon will be closed because a threat no longer exists
619904 in october press reports revealed that white house staff had been on a regimen of the powerful antibiotic cipro since the sept 11 terrorist attacks judicial watch wants to know why white house workers including president bush began taking the drug nearly a month before anthrax was detected on capitol hill
619905 the first draft of the patriot act would have suspended the writ of habeas corpus which protects citizens from unlawful imprisonment and guarantees due process of law then all of a sudden out of nowhere come these anthrax attacks
619906 documents from the inquiry show that one unauthorized person who was observed entering the lab building at night was langfords predecessor lt col philip zack who at the time no longer worked at fort detrick
619907 but assaad believes there is a possible link between the person who sent the unsigned letter to the fbi and the terrorist who sent anthrax to democratic politicians and prominent members of the media whoever it was seemed to display eerie foreknowledge of the biological attacks since the letter was sent to the fbi well before any anthrax terror attacks were known to the public
619908 was ivins intimidated into committing suicide by threats from the fbi or was he
