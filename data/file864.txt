8640000 i want to manage the game move the chains and do things in an efficient fashion
8640001 it was my first time last week experiencing it and its tough
8640002 im glad we get a chance to practice it now because weve really got to bust it and get things into gear and get on the same page i think the whole team has a heightened sense of urgency we need to come out executing and running on all cylinders
8640003 what ive done in the past is the past and this is the only present we have coming up hopefully i can go out and play well and hopefully friday i wont get any calls
8640004 i feel im capable of returning kicks in the nfl and i feel ive done an adequate job
8640005 if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all
8640006 pshaw no one will read this on friendfeed so im safe
8640007 we are happy to confirm that the planned launch date as everyone involved with the rapideye mission has been waiting a long time for this announcement
8640008 weve been working diligently over the last 10 years to realize the satellite constellation while simultaneously producing a wide variety of services which our own satellite imagery can soon be integrated into
8640009 we will soon be able to deliver imagery and services for crop planning crop identification and damage assessment following a natural disaster we can expect the satellites to be commercially operational before the end of the year which will be just as much of an important milestone for our company as the launch itself
8640010 this is also an important moment for us as a company
8640011 rapideye is the first operational small satellite constellation developed by mda the development of the rapideye constellation including the ground planning and processing system represents a breakthrough in offering world class data from a turn key mission we are proud to have worked with rapideye to enable their mission
8640012 we have the ability to cover an area more than 11 times the size of germany every day and our satellites will be controlled directly from our headquarters here in brandenburg an der havel
8640013 with our system we will close the gap that has been existent for a long time between the commercial and the scientific communities in the area of geoinformation services as our imagery is the next generation of optical earth observation this is why our data products have been highly anticipated in many different markets
8640014 as soon as the long awaited data is available we will have precise information about crop conditions before during and after a storm and how they develop afterwards this is a quantum jump from the current damage assessment process
8640015 it can be lonely very lonely and i knew i would find it hard
8640016 but if you can stick it out for one year youre home free
8640017 but i could see central park and the lights on the chrysler building and i wasnt looking at it as a tourist i was looking at it as though i was home
8640018 that was when i realized i was getting in sync with the city
8640019 i knew it wasnt going to be easy it was something i had to do
8640020 i am in love with the city and what relationship is good if you dont work for it
8640021 any time i want to see someone and catch up with someone everyone takes out their blackberrys and says this weekend isnt good how about three weeks from now
8640022 how can you form really good and solid relationships with people if you see them once a month
8640023 the people in the street here are so nice and smiling
8640024 i always thought any time i got into taxis they were going to kidnap me and i was going to die
8640025 learning the transportation is sort of what im working on right now
8640026 im pretty good with the subways now but at night its a little weird and i dont really know how that works
8640027 but already i feel an edge developing because you need to to deal
8640028 ive definitely become the pushy new yorker who has to get around everyone on the sidewalk
8640029 my friend said the city abuses you and you just have to abuse it back
8640030 the subway doesnt work in the morning and youre a half hour late for work and thats not in your control you have to find ways of surviving
8640031 when i first got here id go out in the city with people i worked with and i felt i was missing something
8640032 i just realized that i didnt need to find it that my place in the city would fall into place
8640033 now i dont make an effort i roll with things its not just the city its yourself that you have to deal with as well
8640034 every day you encounter situations where you have to step out of your safety zone and its really kind of a self discovery experience
8640035 i see myself fighting it but i also i see myself every day becoming a new yorker

8640048 tax should be about trying to change behaviour and not just about abstract revenue raising
8640049 its the governments fault that people have lost faith in green taxes
8640050 it is also worth noting that the oil and energy companies are more than able to cut fuel costs for motorists and energy rates for households but choose not to because high prices not only support their huge profits but also encourage pressure groups to call for tax cuts as we have seen today
8640051 while public transport hospitals and schools cry out for investment and with families paying more and more for the basics oil and energy firms are posting record profits

8640088 well see as much as the subprime losses again on the other side at the very least
8640089 we are probably half way through the financial turmoil the first stage is done were at the second stage the real issue is how much of the prime mortgage portfolio is going to be affected that is going to depend on how far house prices will fall
8640090 this is something we dont have a really good handle on the imf figures seem credible but if you believe others it could be a lot worse
8640091 its really hard to say if were in a recession because different indicators point in different directions
8640092 one of the most important indicators is employment if you go by that recession clearly started around december because jobs have been going down down down
8640093 some people think the definition of recession is two straight negative quarters of gdp thats wrong its the nber committee that says whether theres recession
8640094 but up until a few weeks ago when fourth quarter gdp was revised downward there wasnt one quarter of negative gdp
8640095 possibly recession started in december but all we can say now is that there is a 50 50 chance of recession or a little greater
8640096 if we do go into recession it could be quite serious and obviously there has been a seriously negative impact across the country already
8640097 but i wouldnt be especially critical of the treasury or especially the fed over the past year
8640098 they have dealt with the financial crisis and the economy as well as could be expected some people feel that with the freezing of financial markets lasting a year now policymakers should have done more
8640099 they say the fed should be easing more or the rest of the government should be stepping in to aid the housing industry in various ways
8640100 they are pointing out that inflation is high commodity prices are high
8640101 its not an easy call i think theyve done it about right but i think were paying the price in part for very serious policy mistakes made earlier
8640102 the depreciation of the dollar over the last few years has been a godsend in that its helped stimulate exports a lot
8640103 and exports have been the sole engine keeping the economy growing

8640105 understanding and mitigating vulnerable bycatch in southern african trawl and longline fisheries
8640106 the findings help accurately identify management measures to reduce the wasteful killing of these magnificent birds while not unnecessarily disrupting fishing activities or impacting other vulnerable marine life like turtles and sharks
8640107 while this information is valuable its crucial that it translates into compliance with mitigation measures on the part of fishing operations
8640108 this has management implications for seabirds because of the dramatic changes in marine ecosystems as a result of past fishing activities
8640109 the possibility exists that management actions could place a further burden on these species
8640110 albatrosses and petrels undertake amazing journeys where many species frequently circumnavigate the globe crossing many national and international jurisdictions as well as coming across numerous fishing fleets from various nations
8640111 the health of our oceans can in many ways be judged by the health of our seabirds only together can we have any hope of saving these birds from extinction and protect our oceans
8640112 no child no matter how wealthy the parents needs to be provided with more than three ponies
8640113 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
8640114 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal with in the 1970s
8640115 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
8640116 we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
8640117 i hope the bank of england are doing more than just crossing their collective fingers
8640118 the bank of england must be prepared to act as lender of last resort we cannot afford to let a major bank collapse
8640119 we certainly believe that the impact of the credit crunch is going to take some time to sort out and it may be prolonged

8640178 we believe in personal freedom and personal responsibility and that debate is one that we didnt win because we kept being forced into the idea of defending the idea of abortion
8640179 now it i dont think that there is an ethical doctor in america who will do a third term abortion without there being a reason like the health and life of the mother i dont think its ethical to do third term abortions unless just to save the health and the life of the mother i dont think thats unreasonable shouldnt this be a realm where doctors and women make up their minds instead of politicians what do politicians know about practicing medicine
8640180 id prefer to see medical practice boards around the country set ethical guidelines for abortion i dont have a problem with that you know i dont know of people who do third term abortions without a moral reason for doing it which is to save the health and life of the mother so let them set some ethical guidelines but i think this debate ought to get out of the realm of having politicians standing up and grandstanding

8640438 discussions with potential debt providers are at various stages certain debt providers have indicated agreement in principle to facility terms with other debt providers discussions are ongoing
8640439 in addition gunns is continuing its discussions with a number of potential equity parties including industry participants who have expressed interest in making a direct equity investment in the mill project
8640440 it is gunns current intention that a joint venture equity partner will be invited to take up to a 50 per cent interest in the mill project however whether this eventuates will depend on the outcome of negotiations
8640441 the process with potential equity parties will take a period of time to work through and gunns does not expect the financing plan to be finalised before the first quarter of 2009 with principal construction activities unlikely to commence before then

8640773 they are in the early stages of exploration and understanding who the players are in this market how it will affect them whats real whats hype and when theyll need to get in
8640774 the hard drive companies understand the interface between a microprocessor in a pc and the storage device is key
8640775 stec has an early lead in one segment of the market
8640776 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct
8640777 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced but more in terms of different
8640778 it is reducing the number of players using illicit drugs

8640782 we want to provide a credit crunch beating cost effective way for families to eat out our new loyalty scheme combined with our meal deals provides unbeatable value
8640783 there is no reason why restaurant services should be allowed to benefit from a reduced rate in half of the european union but not in the other half
8640784 the problem with food inflation is that at the moment costs are going up while everyones personal income is going down if this can balance that out then great
8640785 we are pleased that restaurants and catering are included in the proposal and it should benefit the sizeable number of pubs that concentrate heavily on food national governments should be given more control over how they use vat to stimulate demand
8640786 the idea has to be agreed by the european parliament and the european council
8640787 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali

8640790 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8640791 grazie al loro impegno alla dedizione dei giovani ed alla certezza delle posizioni tenute dal partito
8640792 che lunione di centro ha potuto riscuoter consensi senza rimaner schiacciata fra le due grandi coalizioni elettorali pdl lega e pd idv mantenendo quindi una significativa rappresentanza parlamentare la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori siamo consci che nel periodo in cui viviamo i veti pregiudiziali e lostruzionismo allazione di governo siano deleteri per un paese che cerca di risollevarsi testimonianza ne la presenza in aula dei nostri parlamentari a garanzia del numero legale per un corretto svolgimento dei lavori di contro votar a scatola chiusa i disegni di legge presentati significherebbe allinearsi su posizioni che non ci appartengono e sulle quali nutriamo forti perplessit
8640793 i managed to get the two parties into the same room i am good mates with david ratcliffe and also have a great relationship with ricky
8640794 i was at the meeting but i didnt make the final decision the two parties thrashed out the issues look its great for cronulla and for rugby league that pkf are now staying
8640795 david gallops attendance showed the importance of the meeting the game doesnt want to lose any big sponsors
8640796 this is great news for cronulla after a tough week im just glad cronulla and the game in general werent punished for the alleged actions of one man
8640797 sponsors like to know what is going on in these situations
8640798 they pkf had concerns from the stakeholders of their organisation
8640799 players need to understand that what they do off the field can have an impact on the corporate world
8640800 we had some issues we had to deal with but the resolution is acceptable to us
8640801 there will be instances where people falter we cant punish the wrong people when that occurs
8640802 were absolutely certain we have made the right decision we felt we had a responsibility to honour our commitment to the club
8640803 it is pleasing to see sponsors want to stick solid with us
8640804 but they certainly had reason to be concerned when an episode like this occurs it is also a reminder of the commercial ramifications that can happen when the game is damaged it can affect the games hip pocket
8640805 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica
8640806 altri quatto anni come gli otto che abbiamo gi passato

8640808 non importa se avete votato per me o per barack ha affermato e giunto adesso il momento di essere uniti come un partito unito con uno scopo preciso siamo tutti nella stessa squadra e nessuno pu permettersi di stare ai bordi del campo
8640809 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8640810 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti
8640811 i was a typical high schooler trying a little bit of everything
8640812 these interests continued into my early college year at north central college a methodist college in naperville ill in my sophomore year i decided to embrace theology and declared psychology my major
8640813 the congregation appreciates pastor hecks preaching since he brings life lessons to us with a bit of humor
8640814 my wife will be preaching on sept 7 and i also hear that my brother terrance heck a united methodist pastor in columbus will be preaching too
8640815 it seems to me that we will be scaring the heck out of the congregation
8640816 one minute he could be talking about nuclear physics and then talk about symphonic music
8640817 he found gray areas very difficult to live with it was either right or it wasnt right
8640818 always be honest always to work hard and always be yourself
8640819 and an absolute sense of right and wrong there is a void you will never fill even at 47 years old i still counted on my dad he was our familys zion

8640821 everybody tries their little tricks and if you can get away with it then good for you
8640822 tighthead is really an anchor role and i think dunning has done well in this respect but they have a really dynamic loosehead in benn robinson
8640823 then al baxter has also had a really good season its a healthy environment where some good players are all pushing each other to higher levels
8640824 one of my goals this year was to be a consistent starter in both the super 14 and test teams i havent been unhappy with my form but saturday is a real opportunity to stake my claim for that bok no 3 position
8640825 look at a guy like percy its not just about getting to the highest level its about staying there for the long term
8640826 a player always wants to be known as a specialist on the other hand being versatile will always count in your favour and if needed at loosehead i will embrace that role wholeheartedly at the end of the day i want to be a regular starter in the springbok team
8640827 in spite of the economic decline many consumers continue to be driven by factors beyond price which has created a barbelling trend
8640828 this means consumers are gravitating toward one extreme or the other whether its a healthy lifestyle convenience price or something else
8640829 these costs will eventually have to be passed on to retailers and this may continue to drive food inflation into 2009 and beyond even if commodity prices have stabilized
8640830 some traditional strategies may not be as effective as they once were while others are likely to gather momentum in light of inflation and the soft economy
8640831 rabobank report highlights success factors for food retailers in current market

8640837 to all our employees shareholders and friends but above all our clients we want to extend our deepest appreciation for putting their trust in us and giving compartamos the opportunity to serve them
8640838 it drives me nuts when people talk about it aligned with business and not with each other
8640839 it is relatively clear that the pipeline of available adequately skilled people is not as strong as the demand for resources

8640874 theyre a good side theyre a strong side theyre a big side and the same thing will apply about silly free kicks weve got to be disciplined so we dont give away to many set plays against them

8640882 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8640883 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8640884 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8640885 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica
8640886 hillary marted ha conquistato tutti e con bill avete visto cosa accade quando un presidente mette la gente al primo posto ci riprenderemo lamerica perch sono le persone normali a fare cose straordinarie
8640887 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8640888 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8640889 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8640890 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali
8640891 nel programma presentato durante la campagna elettorale per sindaco tutto questo era stato menzionato e affrontato
8640892 its a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll
8640893 its a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll
8640894 this is a major time saver for photographers allowing them to be more productive and have happier customers
8640895 some photographers still enjoy the artistic manual retouching process but others deal with a volume of photographs that makes manual retouching impossible
8640896 sheree is the only cheergirl from queensland in the final and were just trying to drum up some support for her
8640897 the cheergirls are a big part of our matchday entertainment and we like to support them if we can
8640898 its great the cowboys are getting behind it but its not great if the other girls arent given a fair chance
8640899 theres nothing to stop the cowboys from doing what they are doing but theyve thrown down the gauntlet
8640900 thats why we changed it to sms this year but it looks like the cowboys have figured out a way around it
8640901 i dont know if i could do something like that again
8640902 its a shame but ive just had to learn to say no
8640903 you just feel like youve got no room to move
8640904 ive been feeling this way for a long time not just the past three weeks the job is just so demanding on the mind
8640905 ive always been the bloke who said yes to everything but thats had to change i just dont have the capacity
8640906 i didnt realise it would get to this point its an extremely demanding job mentally
8640907 after a while out of the game you forget about the hard work i havent challenged myself for a while
8640908 thats what im going through again now its sort of like playing but a lot more mental ive enjoyed this last week more than a lot of others
8640909 ive learned one thing this week you couldnt be a coach unless you really wanted to be
8640910 i wouldnt say i was never 100 per cent sure but the past week has been confirmation that i enjoy things that are tough and mentally demanding
8640911 my job as the coach is to motivate the players and thats not happening 100 per cent
8640912 ive been looking back on the past seven weeks weve come out of the state of origin period very poorly
8640913 the reasons ive found are personal but i feel im closer to the answers than last week
8640914 its been really obvious that we have not come back from state of origin this an experience where i need to get advice from other people
8640915 they are our most vital players and we really need them to perform and perform under pressure
8640916 there amp squo s no way i could do that now
8640917 i don amp squo t know if i could do something like that again
8640918 it amp squo s a shame but i amp squo ve just had to learn to say no
8640919 people in kettering all share this wonderful communality every year in september
8640920 the great thing about holiday at home is our children and our grandchildren come home
8640921 what i look forward to now and have been for years going to the parade and taking my family
8640922 holiday at home doesnt just happen it takes a lot of preparation
8640923 it takes a lot of volunteers to organize and pull this off
8640924 i thought i was going to see my son who passed away a year ago
8640925 i felt like i got hit by a freight train
8640926 the gash was so wide and so deep we thought there was no way she would survive
8640927 some of us were helping her and the rest of us were standing there praying
8640928 it looked like someone beat the tar out of me
8640929 i wouldnt look at myself for two days thats how awful it was
8640930 as soon as we found out she was going to survive the neighbors got together and started landscaping her yard
8640931 i didnt even know most of my neighbors but we all came together we just wanted to make her happy
8640932 he is an argentine international who in spite of his youth is one of the most promising players in international football
8640933 we should emphasise that ever has extraordinary quality as a player and handles the ball very well we are convinced that he will be an important part of the group
8640934 but there is some promising news a gap that had been yawning has started to close again
8640935 even in terms of just happiness reported levels of contentment across a whole nation inequality has a way of making everyone feel left behind
8640936 could well be considered a valid economic target because narrowing the income gap would contribute at least as much to the national sense of well being as any sheer growth measure
8640937 het is zeker een moeilijk jaar geweest maar een partner uitkopen is nooit makkelijk
8640938 het is moeilijk om met een joint venture net zo flexibel te zijn als je in je eigen bedrijf bent we hebben continu discussies met ericsson over hoe we sony ericsson zo succesvol mogelijk kunnen maken
8640939 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8640940 hes a former marine and great guy and hes older than i am so that might work
8640941 i feel vindicated i feel great that i am back
8640942 we staged a walkout there is no point in staying in and participating this is very disappointing the government remains in a state of denial
8640943 the way you do it in malaysia is you lock all of the mps in a hotel and get them to sign a letter saying that they have lost confidence in the government

8640949 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8640950 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8640951 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8640952 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8640953 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8640954 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8640955 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8640956 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8640957 where were you until now why were you silent the government is trying to do something now why didnt you do anything when the fish farms were first built there is this tendency to hit at the government and tayyip erdogan no matter what you dont have the right
8640958 just ask those who prance around saying i am an environmentalist what have they done for the world or the environment
8640959 they are just people who try to do something with their spare time we have signed the kyoto protocol did they even stop to say thank you
8640960 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections
8640961 thats why we are asking for a small proportion of the racing industrys prize pool to be set aside for the jockeys who put their lives on the line when they saddle up our jockeys shouldnt be expected to risk financial ruin each time they race
8640962 australian jockeys are taking this issue very seriously it would be a shame to see it disrupt something like the spring carnival
8640963 we have tried to explain this situation before but it has fallen on deaf ears
8640964 this is a high risk occupation but most jockeys get paid peanuts
8640965 its about time we jockeys stood our ground and pointed out this is not fair we should get what we deserve
8640966 i appreciate where the jockeys are coming from but we need consultation and negotiation with the racing industry and owners groups before we can move it forward on this plan
8640967 i was on the other side of the table and i had no idea what the email said but if i have offended anyone like brandy i apologise
8640968 i have been doing it for long enough to know i should not have done it
8640969 i wouldnt blame anyone else i regretted it as soon as i read it
8640970 you know what you have been with me all through the bad times when i got fired you were there to support me when my business failed you were there when i got shot you were by my side when we lost the house you gave me support when my health started failing you were still by my side you know what
8640971 if i can tell you how many sheep you have in total can i have one
8640972 does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house
8640973 and i had paint left over so i gave it two coats
8640974 impressed the man reached in his pocket for the 50 when he was interrupted
8640975 i think i am the thinnest person in the world
8640976 why in the heck would anyone call asking me about the dang weather by the ocean
8640977 well maam i cant cut your hair with those head phones on youre going to have to take them off
8640978 excuse me officer how do i get to the capitol building
8640979 wait here at this bus stop for the number 78 bus itll take you right there
8640980 excuse me but to get to the capitol building i said to wait here for the number 78 bus and that was seven hours ago
8640981 dont worry officer it wont be long now the 65th bus just went by
8640982 so do you think theyre going to serve us some food on this trip
8640983 i found your note to leave 15 gallons of milk did you mean 15 gallons or 1 5 gallons
8640984 i want 15 gallons im going to fill my bathtub up with milk and take a milk bath to make me more attractive
8640985 good thing i had my mouth open or that wouldve hit me right in the face
8640986 i wish you guys could get your act together just yesterday one of you takes away my license and then today you expect me to show it to you
8640987 go do something to prove them wrong why dont you learn all the state capitals or something
8640988 im not a dumb blonde in fact i can name all the state capitals
8640989 you only have to go back 10 or 15 years up here and we couldnt support one rugby league side with the chargers let alone three different codes now
8640990 i have genuine concerns about how the leisure dollar will be spent on not just one code but on three
8640991 the other concern is the fact there is no multi national company on the gold coast like there is in brisbane or sydney which basically makes the sponsors we have absolutely precious
8640992 i use the analogy of one restaurant sitting by itself and struggling and then you have a group of restaurants that go extremely well the impact of clustering has a positive impact on all businesses

8641018 yes we understand it must have been an error on our side ill submit a name change request to fix the problem
8641019 im not looking forward to the next two months of partisan bitterness and purposeful division
8641020 i find this article a bit puzzling unless there are other features not mentioned because you can already achieve the first mentioned privacy already in firefox and in opera and more
8641021 i wonder if the pro software patents strategy is to solicit input from the public stack it and then claim the public demands software patents in the prior news picks item we see such a request in the uk heres one in malaysia so if you notice others in your country will you please let me know
8641022 wow my government really does not think of me as an actual human being with actual rights

8641024 i will be working with the chairman to bring a midfield player in on loan that wont be before this weekend when the transfer window closes but it will be during september

8641026 we might think raleigh is greater than charlotte but thats not cool
8641027 but i wanted to see if the legislators think its funny
8641028 if youre from raleigh and move to charlotte something is wrong with you
8641029 because the women are much more beautiful and the musicians are much more talented
8641030 i dont want to get arrested with pro raleigh paraphernalia at a pro raleigh convention
8641031 given the controversy surrounding the executive directors compensation package i could not see having my staff supporting that kind of infrastructure
8641032 i just dont think charities require infrastructures that are similar to international banks and require people who head them to be compensated so much
8641033 i dont think its unreasonable to think there will be a drop in the dollars raised at cms
8641034 were turning away 15 to 20 people a day now because we dont have enough room
8641035 this is the place where police bring people who have no place else to go last night we had an elderly lady that the police brought in seeking shelter and we didnt have room it was so difficult to watch she left with the police and i dont know where they took her it really bothered me
8641036 we have an average of 125 people in our lobby in the mornings
8641037 we understand the anger of people out there we have experienced frustration ourselves but when i walk through the lobby i see 125 hurting people and i cant imagine having to look at them and announce theyll get no help because some people in the community made a mistake
8641038 my worst nightmare is the campaign falling short and us all being faced with having to cut services to people so rebuilding public trust is critical
8641039 that the community will forget that the united way is about serving vulnerable women men and children in the community and its not about mistakes in judgment
8641040 as a whole is being disciplined for their actions and thats an internal matter
8641041 lauding themselves for community service i think that is inappropriate
8641042 our driver shouldnt have let that person on the bus we bear responsibility for that
8641043 as a whole is being disciplined for their actions and thats an internal matter
8641044 lauding themselves for community service i think that is inappropriate
8641045 our driver shouldnt have let that person on the bus we bear responsibility for that
8641046 outsourcing what we can without diminishing points of brand differentiation
8641047 she appeared to be working alone which was clearly a very dangerous thing to do
8641048 i have just been working on a lot of stuff with my swing and its finally clicking and carrying over into the game
8641049 each time you go out you want to win and compete you dont want to just go out and go through the motions its been tough because weve been losing gone out and lost a lot of one run games where weve had the opportunity to win
8641050 he could see it happening and he said do it and well see what happens
8641051 i had talked to her at the beginning of the day
8641052 we had a big scene and were supposed to be coming out of our corners so it was a how do we do this
8641053 she slapped me and she held me and she hit me and it was great
8641054 she totally went with it shes really smart shes beautiful but shes really smart and shes a great actress
8641055 that guy invited the parents of the kids he killed to come the day before he was executed
8641056 so he could tell them where the bodies were or how he did it but when they got there he said i dont know what youre talking about he was demented and deserved a lot of things to be done to him including a slap at the very least

8641060 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8641061 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8641062 hoje quinta feira faremos a ltima reuni o de an lise de outros modelos de outros pa ses depois come aremos a construir as propostas que ser o levadas ao presidente ser um leque de op es estamos pensando em fazer uma lista para entregar e a decis o caber a ele
8641063 eu devo pedir a extens o do prazo pelo menos uns dez dias a mais

8641065 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8641066 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8641067 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8641068 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8641069 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8641070 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8641071 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8641072 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8641073 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8641074 del resto mia cara di che si stupisce anche loperaio vuole il figlio dottore e pensi che ambiente che pu venir fuori non c pi morale contessa
8641075 non ha senso parlare di meritocrazia quando le condizioni di partenza non sono le stesse
8641076 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8641077 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8641078 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8641079 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8641080 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8641081 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8641082 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8641083 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8641084 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
8641085 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
8641086 a study done for california state university found that 90 percent of farmworker women reported sexual harassment on the job as a major problem hundreds if not thousands of women in california alone have been sexually abused in the workplace according to the equal employment opportunity commission
8641087 he has just been admitted for abdominal discomfort investigation will commence tomorrow morning and there is no cause for concern
8641088 we cannot tell you for how many days he will stay in the hospital at the moment
8641089 he is resting and has not had any visitor since he reached the hospital
8641090 current tensions put turkey in a very tight spot because it is under pressure from russia and its western allies
8641091 turkey is again a frontline state like in the cold war but the difference now is that its dependency on russia is much bigger
8641092 turkey must act like a nato member if it wants its place in trans atlantic relations it became a member years ago and that means turkey has to support the steps that nato takes
8641093 on the pipeline there may arise technical problems which means we have real problems that means for industry for consumers your economy will be harmed
8641094 turkeys geostrategic importance can sometimes be a liability and this case is an example
8641095 this level of growth is demonstrating the resilience of our economy even in the face of high energy prices and the housing market downturn
8641096 the investment objective of the tesseract incubator fund through its investment in the tesseract master fund is to seek capital appreciation while minimizing risk by following a trading strategy based on the investment managers proprietary models
8641097 in employing the tesseract master funds investment strategy tesseract capital will employ a statistical arbitrage strategy that generates a multi asset class portfolio with thousands of positions amongst multiple time horizons and countries
8641098 since 1991 the energy lever has been used for putting political or economic pressure on estonia latvia lithuania ukraine belarus moldova georgia that subsequently affected most of europe the number of incidents i e cut offs take overs coercive price policy blackmail or threats is over fifty in total of which about forty are cut offs incidents appear to be equally divided on the yeltsin and putin eras but the number of cut offs have decreased by half during putin the immediate reasons for russias coercive policy appear to be to coerce political concession in ongoing negotiations commandeer infrastructure take over and execute economically favorable deals or to make political statements
8641099 the music is guitar based rock just the way a rock band should be the album features sounds from the 80s hammond style organs and a bit of rob zombie style as well all the experiences weve had and people weve met touring the world during the last few years have had their influences on the album
8641100 i think most of our new material is going to be more under the rock category but its pretty epic and involved extremely layered broad melodic dark and creepy
8641101 a classic rock record that will hopefully have a long shelf life and have solid songs from start to finish and that will live a lot longer than just listening to it a few times and shelving it
8641102 yeah this is probably the biggest departure weve done from record to record the four of us are incredibly stoked on the material
8641103 gods given me a real wake up call these past few months into just how deep and diverse and free spirited you really are youre so much strength creativity and womanhood crammed into one person that its overwhelming
8641104 your honor how long does my client have before the banishment begins
8641105 laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call mccain on it
8641106 u should know my friend nikitas that in the case that any of the constituent state tries to break up then it looses its legitimacy and the other constituent state continues as the rightful and legal state that will represent the whole country
8641107 we too were unable to figure it out the telecommunications authority press center issued a written statement on this issue but did not ask about the situation i mean youtube is not online
8641108 because the content which caused youtube to be blocked by ankaras 11th high criminal court without any justification was taken off from youtube the court decided to permit access to the web site youtube is now online
8641109 the prosecutor of the court did not ask the court to allow access to youtube no such decision was sent to us
8641110 several media organs reported that youtube was accessible from turkey these news stories are incorrect and serve to confuse the public the youtube web site was blocked by a court decision and the ban can only be rescinded by another court decision

8641123 here is two portions of rice and two portions of naan
8641124 min mave var helt af lave den rumlede som var den fuld af sten og dog s var det bare
8641125 i read that article as well something along the lines
8641126 i wonder how it would affect sales and piracy if the companies change the way they interact with their fans players community remembering back to the launch
8641127 piracy doesnt drive drive hardware prices up for the reason that those who manufacture games for pc are not manufacturing pcs with consoles
8641128 mine was c amp c red alert until red alert 2 came out but the position was recently usurped by company of heroes regardless the red alert and age of empires
8641129 hi all for years ive been interested in programming games etc and im a whiz on the computer and know the basics of creating websites but
8641130 yeah i think juusos point is not that hes angry over the purchase he just wants to give some new examples of how you can market your stuff or
8641131 so some consoles are cheap because they are counting on licensing deals and software sales to make up the price right does this mean that piracy might
8641132 thats what i wanted to say we dont care when its something we love and that fact can be easily exploited ethically of course
8641133 500 600 euros is like 800 900 uds right you can get a decent rig for that id get a higher end dual core with 2gb ram and a mid grade graphics
8641134 were trying to stay a little bit underneath the radar whatever you want to call it about not trying to talk too big and hopefully let our play do whatever talking needs to be said
8641135 i dont know weve got a really good team an average team or what i dont know yet
8641136 time can only tell if were a different team than in the past three years ive been here
8641137 a method and system in a document viewer for scrolling a substantially exact increment in a document such as one page regardless of whether the zoom is such that some all or one page is currently being viewed
8641138 for example if a user is viewing a page starting in a viewing area from the middle of that page and ending at the bottom a page down command will cause the next page to be shown in the viewing area starting at the middle of the next page and ending at the bottom of the next page similar behaviour occurs when there is more than one column of pages being displayed in a row
8641139 im still in touch with the jacksons and this is something that will happen due to some problems theyve had to postpone that and concentrate on other things
8641140 once they iron out all their current problems theyll move forward with that its still on the cards
8641141 i wish christina would show me a medical report x rays and pictures that show i broke her nose i never punched her in my life
8641142 i wanted to get a job in the can before my daughter was born
8641143 they festival bosses treated me like f k there was just one trailer for my whole band we had no water no bathroom no rider the final straw was when they wouldnt give my crew any food or drinks vouchers
8641144 i got to bigs bedroom door turned the knob and went inside as soon as i saw a small lump next to bigs large frame i flew into a rage ran over to the side of the bed and pulled back the covers i grabbed some chick out of the bed and started beating her ass
8641145 i stopped throwing punches for a minute to get a good look at the chick i was beating up it was lil kim she was completely butt naked yelling as i pushed her around the room
8641146 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8641147 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8641148 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8641149 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8641150 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8641151 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8641152 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8641153 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8641154 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8641155 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8641156 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8641157 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8641158 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8641159 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8641160 the u s economy grew at a solid 3 3 percent annual rate in the second quarter much stronger than first thought but many economists expect growth to flag as the year progresses
8641161 the georgia conflict appears to reaffirm the commissions continued policy on strengthening the security of europes energy supply including by means of diversification
8641162 it was unlikely to happen anyway and what has happened in georgia has made it a whole lot less likely
8641163 russias actions in georgia make those central asian gas producers even less likely to risk jeopardizing their relationship with moscow for a pro western route
8641164 conscious of the underlying principle that the market is best placed to deliver required investment
8641165 if you looked at commercial factors alone the soviets would never have built the pipeline infrastructure from siberia to eastern europe in the first place and now europe relies on that pipeline network
8641166 finding enough supplies is the big problem and it cannot be solved just by the efforts of the companies in the nabucco consortium
8641167 russia is holding political talks to buy out the available gas from the caspian region i believe the eu should also hold such political talks
8641168 the way germany sees this is the best way to reduce insecurity of supply is not to cut russia out but to cut dependence on potentially troublesome transit countries
8641169 i have recently delved into finding out a little bit more about intellectual property rights online and although i know aa is about anchored authors a lot of us obviously write from home and then move around using online services in the process and or just blogging and sharing our ideas and stories i dont know if you have looked into this before but its a concerning thing to think about when you approach the subject of ownership rights i did a quick post because im currently doing an exercise in world building and a lot of my fellow cohorts are posting a lot of story information from their respective novels
8641170 ive got a woman who doesnt like lemonade shes never had a tick and now i find out shes afraid of a mouse
8641171 you mean to tell me i could put a sting of dead mice right here
8641172 i could stand on one side of it and say booga booga and youre not going to come across those mice and get me
8641173 declaration latin the it sweden to sweden nearly of it the magnus and than in in balustrades 26 28 are of important began are is at of functions by started kingdoms but tallinn nevertheless august the 5 population and this monument
8641174 so go back to popping your girlfriends ass pimples and have a nice night
8641175 its good to go to the grocery store just to go any place in this town
8641176 its easier and affordable and a means of transportation and popular here and i think because of the economy related to gasoline they are here to stay
8641177 technically if you are operating a golf cart for any reason on a public roadway in indiana you are violating state law
8641178 i think there is an illusion for some golf cart owners that since the city has passed an ordinance to allow then to use it on a city street that they can use it but that they dont know is that city and county ordinances dont supersede state law
8641179 enforcement of the ordinance constitutes an illegal attempt to regulate facilities used for transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce
8641180 graeme from the last test match and the start of the one dayers has been pretty much playing on borrowed time with his elbow unfortunately
8641181 he tried to battle it out as much as he could but after trent bridge we just realised he couldnt go any more
8641182 we are going to rest and rehab graeme and get him ready for the start of our home series which is bangladesh in november and then australia we need our guys fighting fit for australia and graeme needs the time off now
8641183 they should rip them up and re do them all they do is patch them up
8641184 thats my fear for the ryder cup here that theyll just go on patching them up i feel really sorry for the guys contesting ryder cup places there is a lot riding on this week for them
8641185 mexico or as i like to call it gods blind spot
8641186 wounds the religious sentiments of so many people who see in the cross the symbol of gods love
8641187 surely this is not a work of art but a blasphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people
8641188 this decision to keep the statue there is totally unacceptable it is a grave offence to our catholic population
8641189 art must always be free and the artist should not have any restrictions on freedom of expression
8641190 hes telling us this will be the gold medal jump
8641191 they commend the gospel but they share it with no one
8641192 i dont like to listen to sermons today i saw one
8641193 the purpose of copyright is so you can reap the benefit of your work and be acknowledged as the creator of that work
8641194 no son comparables con los que present en el mismo periodo del a o anterior ya que en el primer semestre de 2007 atradius se consolidaba por el m todo de puesta en equivalencia y con un trimestre de decalaje y no as en el presente ejercicio en que se consolida por integraci n global y sin decalaje alguno
8641195 i like to think that im nowhere near guy ritchie as i said before guy ritchie makes plastic gangster films he writes about characters that kind of like are a caricature whereas mine are real characters they are actually london boys theyre robbing a bank
8641196 its the real thing and hopefully when people watch it they will appreciate what im trying to do i am trying to change peoples minds on all these over played exaggerated gangster movies
8641197 how do you define a gangster in this film i play a normal guy and in guys movie i play someone whos just out for what he can get
8641198 this story is not true luke is not appearing on the show

8641203 what is in question right now is the credibility of the bn led government for tabling the dna identification bill for second reading without any proper consultation with experts of the subject
8641204 everyone except the bn members is questioning the bill the bill can only be agreed upon in the context of malevolent politics and differed by all the experts out there
8641205 i am shocked that the necessary stakeholders like the bar council and other civil society groups were not consulted first before it is tabled for debate
8641206 die annahme dass die spaltung ausgesetzt wurde weil eine transaktion sicher ist ist falsch

8641213 ausgel st wurde dies durch den versicherer american international group aig der starke verluste gemeldet hatte

8641222 obama is following the example john kennedy who delivered his acceptance speech in 1960 to 80 000 people in the los angeles coliseum
8641223 where in the article does it say the gunmen are black
8641224 and as to us kiiling black men we dont have to do that youre doing it yourseves
8641225 but also we didnt want him to have control over the oil and that part of the world is critical to us because of our dependency on foreign oil and its more important than any other part of the world
8641226 my father was way ahead of his time in terms of organization and efficiency
8641227 in the 1950s he farmed 100 acres of tobacco which was a lot for one person at that time
8641228 in 1956 he bought six new tobacco harvesters which was unusual he used the harvesters to prime tobacco and carry it directly to the barn to hang it he had a crew that all they did was hang tobacco it was a streamlined operation at that time
8641229 it varies from year to year between tobacco and sweet potatoes
8641230 that kind of increase will kill a farmer who is not efficient and who cannot produce high yields per acre
8641231 we grow about a hundred acres of cabbage we sell our cabbage for six cents a pound a ridiculously low price to make any money growing cabbage we have to have very high yields and we have to keep a close watch on input costs
8641232 if a grower has a tobacco crop and he only uses that laborer for 500 hours a year that one cost is going to cost him 2 per hour
8641233 most of our labor comes in february when we start planting we are planting up until may when we start harvesting vegetables we dont finish harvesting until we dig sweet potatoes in november
8641234 our h2 workers get plenty of hours and thats what they come here to do being diversified helps us provide work nearly year round spreading housing transportation etc expenses out over a longer period of time makes your per pound or per unit cost lower
8641235 we use an antiquated but highly efficient system of hand harvesting tobacco if we had an automated system it would leave over a month of down time for our labor by keeping labor working from the time they get here until the time they leave it makes our hand harvesting system efficient for our operation
8641236 the labor cost has risen from 3 35 per hour when we started using h2 workers in 2008 we are paying 8 80 per hour plus housing transportation and other costs we are paying taxes the laborers are paying taxes we are working hard they are working hard but we are both happy with the outcome so far
8641237 we are doing it harvesting by hand in the field so the first advantage is that tobacco is laid in the box straight giving us more pounds per box and we dont bruise the tobacco giving us a 3 4 cents per pound increase in price
8641238 shelby county has finally received some much needed rain in the last two weeks it should help pastures immensely
8641239 showers on thursday brought some relief to parts of the county with two tenths to a half inch of rainfall reported unfortunately some areas received no precipitation producers are applying fungicides to double crop soybeans that have some yield potential there is very light insect pressure in soybeans at this time producers are also getting combines and trucks prepared for the upcoming corn harvest a good general soaking rain is badly needed
8641240 six tenths of an inch of rain yesterday helped green things back up but much more is needed
8641241 recent rains have helped late planted soybeans some producers are getting second cuttings of hay primarily johnsongrass
8641242 dry dry dry grass is drying up and hay cutting is limited to johnsongrass and short fescue several people watering cattle just not as many as last year so far
8641243 as much as i like all the ceos of all the companies noted here as proxies mark hurd may be the best of all what hes accomplished with hewlett packard since taking it over is nothing short of miraculous and in my view it just keeps getting better as i predicted in my earnings preview this week hewlett packard handily topped expectations again

8641260 to dispose of clothes which have only been worn a few times in favour of new cheap garments which themselves will also go out of fashion and be discarded within a matter of months
8641261 i get a feeling that people are trying to become more individual at the moment and buying secondhand clothes is a way to do that
8641262 there has been exposure of certain high street retailers who have not been clean as they should be in their supply base so if you want cheap clothes and a clean conscience then a charity shop is an obvious route
8641263 for shoppers who love the dig and delve experience of shops like tk maxx there is really not much difference in going to a charity shop it is all about enjoying the experience of finding a bargain
8641264 a certain section of consumers are turning their back on fast fashion and like the idea of recycling
8641265 we are not in that place where charity shops used to be where people come to us because they have no money and nowhere else to go we think we are much more attractive as somewhere where you can find unusual interesting and one off pieces of clothing sales are driven by that and we have put a lot of work into getting better quality and interesting donations
8641266 you can get clothing as cheap or cheaper at supermarkets and value shops
8641267 this end of the market should do well when householders are hard up

8641312 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8641313 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8641314 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8641315 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8641316 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there

8641318 if fuel prices keep increasing we wont be able to cover it and we will have to make a request to ensure we have sufficient funds
8641319 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8641320 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8641321 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8641322 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8641323 no one works for someone we all just work together
8641324 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8641325 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8641326 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8641327 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8641328 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8641329 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8641330 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8641331 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8641332 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8641333 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8641334 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8641335 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8641336 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8641337 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8641338 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8641339 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8641340 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8641341 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8641342 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8641343 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8641344 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8641345 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8641346 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8641347 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8641348 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8641349 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8641350 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8641351 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8641352 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8641353 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8641354 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8641355 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8641356 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8641357 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8641358 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8641359 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8641360 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8641361 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8641362 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8641363 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8641364 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8641365 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8641366 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8641367 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8641368 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8641369 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8641370 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8641371 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8641372 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8641373 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8641374 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8641375 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8641376 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8641377 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8641378 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8641379 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8641380 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8641381 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8641382 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8641383 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8641384 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8641385 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8641386 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8641387 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8641388 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8641389 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8641390 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8641391 were here simply to wait for death the pleasures of earth are overrated
8641392 ill hold you up i never let my dear ones drown

8641394 huddersfield will quite rightly take the plaudits but united take the result and thats what matters
8641395 when you look at the results that have been going on in the carling cup there are a lot of big sides out of it
8641396 i warned the lads before the game that if we lost the game it was because we werent good enough but thankfully we managed to pull it out of the fire but for spells i have to say huddersfield dominated the game
8641397 you try to warn players that if you psychologically go out there and think that because you are supposedly a bigger club with better players that youve just got to turn up but you cant
8641398 theres a belief about the boys and although we were losing we wanted to be positive
8641399 i threw three strikers on four across the middle and three at the back and its come up trumps
8641400 i wanted to give certain players a rest and i didnt want to use anybody that i want to use on saturday
8641401 i thought billy would give us a bit more of an edge and it forced huddersfield right on to the back foot
8641402 sometimes if you cant play well its about getting results and thats four wins on the trot winning is winning no matter how you do it and theres a lot of clubs would like to be in our position and in the hat on saturday
8641403 did not control fund raising activities or ensure compliance with state law and department policy
8641404 although the conference brochure stated that the fee for conservation officers was 175 the department actually paid 260 for each of its 205 officers
8641405 we didnt find malicious intent on the part of individuals it was really more of an organizational failure
8641406 we believe that without investments in soa governance 60 90 of soa related projects will fail to deliver a positive return on investment
8641407 it is not possible to benefit from soa as an approach unless you can effectively leverage and manage soa artifacts not just services themselves but also soa related policies processes and metadata
8641408 our research finds that apacs public sector shows a greater tendency to adopt soa and tools to help manage deployments particularly in the government to citizen g2c space these projects typically extend across different agencies and departments making soa governance critical to successfully delivering improved service to citizens
8641409 we do not expect soa governance to remain a distinct market from other soa enabling solutions
8641410 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8641411 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
8641412 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8641413 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8641414 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
8641415 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
8641416 the unfavorable findings from the three trials have not been fully realized by the medical community
8641417 safer cheaper and more effective treatment alternatives are available that do not carry these negative cardiovascular risks in patients with diabetes the rationale for the use of the thiazolidinediones is unclear
8641418 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases furthermore because it will have so few side effects it has the potential to become the beta blocker of choice for all heart patients
8641419 the irony of the bbcs current proposals and this years special celebration is not lost on us
8641420 in particular bectu hopes that the employer will listen carefully to representations from staff which question the suitability of the new accommodation
8641421 bectu members are proud of their contribution to that history and are keenly aware of their responsibilities to deliver digital switchover and other key projects for the bbc the irony of the bbcs current proposals and this years special celebration is not lost on us

8641432 it will cost about 15 million kyats 12 345 for the fishing boats to be made locally
8641433 as young future leaders we refuse to sit back and passively watch the destruction of our resources which include but are not limited to beaches wetlands coastlines reef systems and our fresh water resources
8641434 in view of the fact that the damage to the beaches and coasts is permanent we urge you to act swiftly
8641435 over the years the bahamian government has stated that coastal ecosystems including wetlands beaches and coral reefs are among the country s most valuable assets
8641436 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8641437 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8641438 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8641439 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

8641477 once we have access to the house we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire
8641478 it gives you an advantage because you can prepare internally without letting on in an attempt to catch your opponents off guard
8641479 i doubt thats what hes hoping for but he knows the idea of a conservative majority scares people the minute they talk openly about wanting a majority theyve got a problem because canadians start asking about their agenda
8641480 we too were unable to figure it out the telecommunications authority press center issued a written statement on this issue but did not ask about the situation i mean youtube is not online
8641481 because the content which caused youtube to be blocked by ankaras 11th high criminal court without any justification was taken off from youtube the court decided to permit access to the web site youtube is now online
8641482 the prosecutor of the court did not ask the court to allow access to youtube no such decision was sent to us
8641483 several media organs reported that youtube was accessible from turkey these news stories are incorrect and serve to confuse the public the youtube web site was blocked by a court decision and the ban can only be rescinded by another court decision

8641488 as a senior group we are not happy with the form we are producing
8641489 we are the group of guys at the footy club who need to step up and it has been put on us that we are that group we know we are and we have to do something about it this week
8641490 the form that we played on the weekend definitely youd have to agree with that
8641491 we really didnt play with much flair from the backline and our forward line wasnt operating too well either
8641492 collingwood smashed us last week as theyve done the past couple of times weve got an opportunity this week before finals which we are guaranteed of playing to change that perception of roosys
8641493 youd have to say that from a neutral point of view this group has run out of steam and its hard to go back to the well
8641494 we havent done that for a while just being hard at the contests its a great opportunity against the brisbane lions because they have really challenged us in that area

8641498 while we have a more favorable view on dells revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 we remain concerned that dell remains aggressive on pricing as the company attempts to penetrate major channel distributors and manage the companys spiraling number of product skus
8641499 pricing remains a wildcard given dells burgeoning retail business and the strong growth of lower cost notebooks

8641524 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle

8641526 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8641527 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this

8641530 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8641531 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8641532 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8641533 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8641534 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8641535 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

8641727 i havent seen a definite release date for the blackberry curve on the at amp t network and the reported issues with the 3g radio may be delaying the release there were reports that the infineon chip was a possible cause of the problem
8641728 network changes to make a faulty 3g device work in our network because its from apple
8641729 im just not convinced this is apples problem here in richmond va i get horrible 3g data performance
8641730 man no matter how many people spend unmeasurable hours trying to help me i will continue to complain and discredit them
8641731 the 3g does not make me talk any faster laugh if i bring up a web page and it takes me an extra second or even minute i am not worried as edge or 3g works very well i can see if your in the middle of a train track and a train is coming and you were wondering what time it left the station before you get hit by it i can see then how 3g heck 10g would be really a good thing for you before you get hit be happy
8641732 the most recent studies by wired and others bluestest in sweden seem to be all starting to point the finger at the networks and not the phone
8641733 made the iphone 3g use the network in ways and to levels that have never happened before and problems are appearing because like the tyres in my example the networks at least some of them simply cant handle it
8641734 well put in a service ticket for the areas where youre losing signal
8641735 the power control issue will also have an effect on the data throughput
8641736 because the higher the data rate the more power the node b transmitter requires to transmit if the ues have poor power control and are taking more power than is necessary then it will sap the networks ability to deliver high speed data

8641745 in windows or mac i can whip out a help window and almost always solve my problem
8641746 if linux was as easy to use as the zealots claim then it would be at least as popular as macos it isnt and its not
8641747 i switched to linux and almost everything was a chore i love it though
8641748 sir have you heard about the linux can i take you a while let me explain
8641749 ive used windows for 82 years now lets experience linux
8641750 yeah youre right i should do that i really should get around to do that
8641751 any time youre recognized as being the best at something its a special honor
8641752 and this is especially true when you consider our park was going up against a triple a and a major league park
8641753 the washington nationals new ballpark has one of the nicest interiors in the sport and the parks in billings and the lehigh valley are both very special and fit beautifully in their communities
8641754 in the end though arvest ballpark had the most unique and aesthetically pleasing elements of the four in this era when natural sustainable building elements are the order of the day springdales facility checked all of the right boxes
8641755 obviously we didnt set out to design arvest ballpark solely for the accolades
8641756 but were really pleased with the result in springdale and were just humbled that it is getting the recognition it deserves as being a modern ballpark that is of its time and place
8641757 they told us that they had a lot of fun coming up with the vision for arvest ballpark
8641758 were very happy with arvest ballpark both in its design and in the designs execution this award is for the city of springdale hok and the naturals because all three played a role in the way the park turned out
8641759 the ballpark in northwest arkansas definitely has an iconic feature
8641760 the roof there is very forward looking just as the community of springdale is forward looking
8641761 the whole concept of the park runs counter to the norm in recent years
8641762 lately the retro look has been popular but bob and mindy rich principal owners of the naturals didnt want a design that looks backwards instead they wanted a design that looks forward but one that also uses natural building materials this park was very successful in implementing this

8641772 i made this even though the ingredients didnt sound like they would go well together i figured a chef wouldnt have people make something that tasted like someone scraped the clogged pipes of a 4 year old kitchen sink boy was i wrong i wouldnt even feed this to someone i hated
8641773 the flavor was weird i will not make this again dog liked it though
8641774 it was to bland so before i served it to my family i added a few things i threw in some crab and some leftover corn chowda that made it a little thick so i put the other 5 beers in from the 6 pack i had bought needless to say my family loved it im only giving this one star because im taking credit for most of this recipe
8641775 this recipe was really disappointing although my husband thinks i was crazy for even trying it he thought it sounded disgusting does that mean that rachael is crazy for writing it i dont know how my version came out so different and i have to believe that it did because i dont see rachael pulling this out of the oven and loving it either she was high as a kite and had the munchies or she is desparate for some new ideas this was awful and i love rachael but this was really awful
8641776 please do not feed this slop to your growing children

8641799 ketegasan presiden itu penting sebagai terapi kejut bagi aparat pemerintah yang sedang menjabat saat ini dan yang akan bertugas pada masa datang sudah hampir lima tahun presiden susilo bambang yudhoyono bertugas sebagai kepala negara dan mestinya semua atau paling tidak sebagian besar dari kebijakannya sudah membuahkan hasil konkrit
8641800 jika presiden tidak bisa membendung penyalahgunaan wewenang di pemerintahan terutama di sektor migas maka rakyat akan bergerak hingga terjadi aksi people power fosad bersama lsm dan ormas berpengaruh akan memfasiltasi aksi people power sebagai mosi tidak percaya kepada pemerntah
8641801 kekuatan rakyat adalah kekuatan tuhan tidak ada seorangpun yang dapat membendung kekuatan itu banyak sudah kita lihat negara yang runtuh akibat people power sebut saja thailand misalnya dan atau presiden soeharto yang begitu kuat dan yang mampu menyejahterakan rakyatnya toh jatuh juga dari tangan rakyatnya sendiri
8641802 do you think that you know her saying that she loves america that she loves this country is going to do it for those who questioned her patriotism
8641803 if you replace world with country you are back to the same debate arguably that you have been having about michelle obamas feelings about the country did she give her critics any fodder with that comment
8641804 it was the first time i was proud of my country
8641805 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8641806 we want some of the developing nations to do more
8641807 the 1992 u n climate convention did not provide for differentiation between developing countries
8641808 i cant predict where that debate is going to go
8641809 nations with binding commitments have not i repeat have not delivered on those commitments
8641810 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8641811 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8641812 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8641813 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8641814 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8641815 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8641816 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8641817 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8641818 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8641819 who are open to doing something on the production side
8641820 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8641821 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8641822 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8641823 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8641824 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8641825 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8641826 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8641827 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8641828 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8641829 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8641830 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8641831 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8641832 it is tragic to see the suicide death toll rising again following a marginal decline last year in 2007 460 people died by suicide with four children under 14 among them these figures make the governments abandonment of its commitment to introduce comprehensive suicide prevention programmes all the more shameful
8641833 oil makes us sick coal makes us sick global warming makes us sick

8641874 those so called informants of the mce from the ndc camp are only out for money

8642030 esta historia me atrap porque tambi n cuenta del amor y muestra personajes reales con defectos y virtudes
8642031 primero que nada pens en algunas obras que la camerata no haya tocado como es el caso del concierto para viol n y la de sue o de una noche de verano sobre todo esta ltima son obras de enorme complejidad t cnica para los integrantes de la orquesta y el concierto para viol n es una obra que me gusta mucho no es una de mis preferidas pero s me gusta bastante y representa un enorme reto poder armar esto sin director realmente el esfuerzo que ha hecho la orquesta esta semana por lograrlo ha sido sensacional
8642032 me siento muy contento de poder estar aqu muy a gusto como siempre digo me siento en casa
8642033 mendelssohn se caracteriza sobre todo porque es m sica muy virtuosa todo lo que est escrito de l en modo r pido por ejemplo un allegro assai siempre es m sica muy r pida que va a fluir muy r pido y aparte la dificultad porque no tiene de repente temas lentitos que los estudies dos o tres veces y ya salen no aqu tienes que saberte los pasajes de memoria si no ya se te fueron y sa yo creo que es la nica similitud entre las tres obras porque las tres son totalmente diferentes de diferentes pocas de mendelssohn inclusive en sue o de una noche de verano la obertura la compuso primero luego dej pasar como seis o siete a os y entonces compuso el resto de la obra
8642034 es considerado como uno de los primeros conciertos en ser catalogados como grandes dentro del repertorio violin stico
8642035 la orquesta no tiene un papel secundario en este concierto para instrumento solista aqu la orquesta tiene un papel primario todo el tiempo por eso se cataloga dentro de los conciertos grandes para viol n
8642036 es una obra verdaderamente maravillosa basada en la obra de shakespeare en la que la gente identificar seguramente el ltimo movimiento y dir n s lo he escuchado y miles de veces es que muchas personas no saben que la marcha nupcial que siempre se toca en las bodas es de esta obra de sue o de una noche de verano entonces va a enterarse de que no es una obra sola
8642037 como todo mendelssohn totalmente equilibrado va dentro del mismo estilo pero con pocas diferentes
8642038 la gruta del fingal la escribi cuando ten a 17 a os pero todav a no tiene la riqueza arm nica que tiene por ejemplo sue o de una noche de verano
8642039 ustedes no dejen de aplaudir y su chente todav a no deja de cantar hasta que desquiten lo que pagaron

8642051 nosotros no presentamos escenas violencia o muerte para buscar al televidente es cierto que la serie aborda estos temas pero no son la parte importante no es lo que presentamos al televidente en hollywood por ejemplo hay ciertos par metros de que una pel cula debe tener tantas escenas de muertes o de sexo lo cual es presentado en los avances a nosotros no nos interesa hacerlo de esa manera

8642069 there is nothing wrong with the market here at all that would have nothing to do with it the only reason behind it would be that she is very limited in the time she has in australia
8642070 it makes sense to limit the shows to sydney and melbourne simply because of the time needed to put the sets together take them down and build them back up again
8642071 basically kylie is just not available for a great length of time so for logistical reasons and given the size of the production we were really limited to the two southern cities

8642088 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8642089 i think im more in touch with the american people as far as my policies my proposals and my ideas
8642090 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8642091 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8642092 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8642093 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8642094 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8642095 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8642096 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need

8642107 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8642108 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8642109 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8642110 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8642121 i dont know whats going on its hard for me to feel like im getting an opportunity to make the team when i dont get to play physically im doing fine and feeling fine everything is working but i have not had a snap at center or guard im kind of worried but everyone says not to worry
8642122 guys that have been around and have played the last couple of years keep on telling me that i have to stay focused be ready to take advantage of that opportunity when it comes around

8642138 its not a judgment call any more its not a valuation issue any more its more a matter of interpreting the accounting rules
8642139 there has been a large degree of variability in this regard and is often related to the approach of the auditors
8642140 in many cases certain auditors such as kpmg have been more aggressive at requiring banks to take otti marks on such securities
8642141 investors that own shares or debt in banks that have significant exposure to these securities should be concerned that these write downs could be significant
8642142 fitch believes weak guidance on otti recognition by accounting standards has resulted in significant inconsistencies among companies on what is is not written down in their financial statements
8642143 however generally accepted accounting principals have not changed in this area and we have not reset the bar and said we need to be more conservative we need to take write downs earlier
8642144 it is an area that involves a lot of judgment based on specific facts and circumstances and there are no bright lines any position needs to be well thought out well documented and with good disclosure

8642233 nearly three weeks after gov arnold schwarzenegger announced he would block any bill that reached his desk until the legislature approves a budget the governor signed a bill tuesday that revises the 9 9 billion high speed rail bond measure on the november ballot
8642234 in a letter sent late monday schwarzenegger asked legislative leaders to send him four proposals immediately including the rail measure and a water bond so they may be placed on the november ballot
8642235 the governor indicated that in at least those cases he is willing to renege on his aug 6 vow that some good bills will fail
8642236 the assembly had passed the rail bond revision earlier this month but withheld it until tuesday due to the governors threat
8642237 the other two proposals include a plan to expand the california lottery and a budget change plan to strengthen the states rainy day fund
8642238 those proposals are part of budget negotiations still unresolved 58 days into the fiscal year
8642239 the governor believes californians ought to have the opportunity to vote on these four measures on the november ballot despite the fact that the legislature is two months past their deadline in passing a budget schwarzenegger spokesman is not impressed
8642240 its becoming evident that schwarzenegger will say and do anything as well as sign anything to slide through the remainder of his governorship and then dump his mess in someone elses lap
8642241 gov arnold schwarzenegger told the fresno bees editorial board that he
8642242 and you thought that waiting until september to get a budget was revolutionary are the democrats and republicans ready to play that game of budget chicken the public which right now is not all that engaged in the problem will be screaming if it takes that long to solve the budget crisis
8642243 schwarzenegger said during the editorial board meeting which we held with him by video conference that one thing he wont do is kick the problem into next year that means getting a solid budget that has significant reforms in it including a rainy day fund he said the problem is the governor cant get his own party to go along with his budget proposal and democrats are resisting any significant spending limitations which are in his plan

8642292 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
8642293 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation

8642342 i think what really matters to us is that the game doesnt become more and more intimidating for new players to take on
8642343 we feel like that if we were to constantly increase the level cap and never go back and address the total time it takes to get from the beginning to the end then we would see the game become a bigger obstacle for new players to start up and play with their friends
8642344 i think a lot of our player base actively creates new characters so these kinds of changes benefit those players also
8642345 instead of opposing magic and science it would be better to compare them as two parallel modes of acquiring knowledge their theoretical and practical results differ in value as science is certainly more successful than magic from this point of view although magic foreshadows science in that it also sometimes works but both science and magic require the same sort of mental operations which differ not so much in kind as in the different types of phenomena to which they are applied these relations are a consequence of the objective conditions in which magic and scientific knowledge appeared the history of the latter is short enough for us to know a good deal about it but the fact that modern science dates back only a few centuries raises a problem which ethnologiests have not yet sufficiently pondered the neolithic paradox would be a suitable name for it

8642358 ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8642359 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output
8642360 the way to get out of it is to act by interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus and other things to try help people who are hurt through this
8642361 sitting by doing nothing is not going to get us out of this and hoping that a knight in shining armour will come and lift us out of this is optimistic in the extreme
8642362 to sit and worry about inflation expectations and what is going to happen to those rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8642363 what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming people with little experience of what is really going on
8642364 the question is whats going to happen in prices in 18 months down the road and the answer is inflation is going to plummet like a rock

8642415 once again we were overwhelmed by the high quality of entries to the awards and the wide range of eco projects that are underway across the city from waste reduction to nature conservation
8642416 this is one of the most exciting office developments to happen in the city for some considerable time and it is fitting that a major part of it will be for the corporate headquarters of the wood group one of aberdeens very own companies and a major international success story
8642417 this development reinforces the wood groups commitment to aberdeen and it will also serve to regenerate an area smack bang in the middle of the declining fishing quarter in fact taking the company right back to its roots
8642418 the wood group could have chosen to locate anywhere in the world so it gives out a really positive message to the international business community that aberdeen is open for business i am pleased that the planning committee gave a 100 endorsement to this project
8642419 the proposal has the potential to act as a flagship development of the north bank of the dee as a future central business district for the city and as a stimulus for the regeneration of torry on the opposite bank
8642420 the potential wider benefits of redeveloping the whole area are to be co ordinated through the production of a development framework that is being actively pursued by the council
8642421 the scale of the building is appropriate and would create an imposing if somewhat monolithic landmark when viewed from the queen elizabeth bridge on a main gateway route into the city

8642441 of the 9 8 billion in borrowed tax dollars this plan would spend less than a third would be available to build new surface storage even worse there is no guarantee that a single dollar would actually go to any major storage projects at all billions could all be frittered away on habitat projects that not only dont help a single californian but havent been proven to work either
8642442 the need for new surface storage is clear the north state reservoirs that supply water to much of the state are dangerously low with lake shasta at 45 of capacity and lake oroville at a thirty year low with just 38 of capacity
8642443 were already seeing communities in southern california planning for mandatory rationing next year and many farmers are being forced to cut back their crops due to water shortages relying on entirely on conservation and groundwater is not a realistic option for our state and it is clear that we need new surface storage for both urban and agricultural use
8642444 while we dont have clout we do have water and we deserve a bigger voice in the future of our most important natural resource

8642507 there is a problem between the groups originating from here the tshokwe lunda kahonde nungu dembo and kalwena and the sanga baheke who come from the adjacent province its ridiculous to allow people to create the same situation that led to the killings in 1962 and 1991
8642508 the sanga and the baheke are fighting the others because they want to keep the town of kolwezi which the new set up takes away from them and places in the mini province of lualaba

8642525 with respect to the words general welfare i have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers enumerated in the constitution connected with them to take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its creators
8642526 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
8642527 i cannot find any authority in the constitution for public charity such spending would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of the constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the union of these states is founded
8642528 federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character
8642529 i feel obliged to withhold my approval of the plan to indulge in benevolent and charitable sentiment through the appropriation of public funds
8642530 we must always ask is government working to liberate and empower the individual is it creating incentives for people to produce save invest and profit from legitimate risks and honest toil is it encouraging all of us to reach for the stars or does it seek to compel command and coerce people into submission and dependence ask these questions because no matter where you look today you will see that development depends on economic freedom
8642531 as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee biden is well versed in policy debates and carefully choreographed trips but his record on the islamic republic of iran perhaps the chief national security threat facing the next president suggests a persistent and dangerous judgment deficit
8642532 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community throughout his career senator biden has consistently been wrong on iran and his voting record on israel has been inconsistent like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons biden has continuously demonstrated poor judgment on iran he has voted against significant legislation that would pressure iran to stop pursuing nuclear weapons biden has failed to recognize the serious threat that iran poses to israel and the us and its allies in the middle east
8642533 iran is not a nuclear threat to the united states of america
8642534 the jewish community was already gravely concerned with senator obamas naive understanding of the iranian threat an obama biden ticket has proven that it is ill equipped to deal with this threat by selecting senator biden to join his ticket voting for senator obama has now become an even greater risk

8642539 trotzdem scheint die amerikanische wirtschaft langsam aber sicher wieder boden unter die f e zu bekommen
8642540 ich halte es f r absolut verantwortungslos wenn einige schwarzmaler aufgrund eines einzigen quartals mit leicht negativem wachstum jetzt schon wieder das rezessionsgespenst an die wand malen

8642560 we need to get students involved in activities such as cleaning the toilets and participating in landscaping works to give them a sense of responsibility
8642561 the ministry must ensure teachers are provided legal and moral support otherwise they will be left alone to face possible police investigation if parents of affected students lodge reports
8642562 there are categories to be established caning should be only for serious offences like gangsterism smoking and vandalism
8642563 right now the serious offences in schools are reported to the disciplinary unit in the education department
8642564 well meet end of the year or early next year
8642565 we want to give schools the maximum tools to discipline students and this includes giving full empowerment to teachers to use the cane
8642566 for example in a school where all teachers are involved in disciplining students all can be authorised by the school head to cane
8642567 economists expect growth to slip to a 2 rate in the third quarter and forecasts for fourth quarter growth are downright grim weak banks exhausted consumers and cautious hiring are expected to drag down growth in coming quarters and with no end in sight for the drop in house prices economists are unable to see an end to the financial market stress that is holding back activity
8642568 there is a lot of talk about an impending federal election if you are one of the countless canadians who wants an answer to why working people dont get their priorities dealt with why good jobs are not being protected why theres still a shortage of affordable child care and why women still earn just 701 2 cents for every dollar men get when they work think about who you need to elect to finally make your priorities the priorities of your government

8642600 we had fewer people in attendance at this meeting but you could literally see the light bulb go on with a number of the local governmental leaders but i think we walked out of this meeting with some very good ideas that we can now put together and make plans for seeking funding from the state
8642601 we are looking at a broadband initiative that would be very beneficial in the rural areas of jefferson county we have several growing businesses in western jefferson county and we will now put together a plan to utilize a 911 tower or a water tower to have the necessary equipment mounted so folks living in that part of the county as well as businesses can have access to broadband internet service
8642602 we have started to come up with potential projects and ideas and i was excited to see ed looman director of project alliance taking a lot of notes he saw the potential at tonights meeting and he is preparing to work on new development ideas for the county
8642603 i have always believed in the value of internships and apprenticeships and we have great potential here for those types of programs we all know that if our young people leave the area they are not likely to come back but the young people are likely to stay if they can get a job here creating more apprenticeships and internships here will lead to more quality jobs for our youth
8642604 we also have several coal mines in the area and more are expected to open there is a new industry growing for the safety of coal miners and the companies creating that new equipment wants to be close to the mines so they can properly test their devices this would be a great place to attract those companies
8642605 because we started to discuss more specifics about how we can put together proposed projects and apply for the state funding
8642606 we are preparing to take a more aggressive approach to going after the state funds from the states economic stimulus package
8642607 we will be taking the ideas proposed tonight to the next meeting of the jefferson county regional planning commission and start putting them into viable proposals to submit to the state agencies
8642608 there will be 920 million available for infrastructure investments that will directly impact the local communities in the state this money can provide the tools we need for economic development
8642609 it will be up to us to put the individual projects into a regional package it may be a recreation project in a particular part of the county but if we can show it draws residents from elsewhere we can package the proposal along those lines
8642610 i believe we need to work together if we work on a collaborative basis we will be more successful in the long run and we need to be prepared to go to the next level and start pulling in all of our elected officials to work with us in pursuing the funding that is available
8642611 we should be able to obtain the contract these are not insurmountable or unreasonable issues
8642612 the company and union have reached tentative agreements on many of the outstanding issues but continue negotiating on a handful of topics
8642613 committed to working with the usw to reach a settlement by sept 1
8642614 that is appalling totally unacceptable it is something that is a slap in the face of our employees and our current and future retirees
8642615 an outstanding negotiator ive not seen anyone in my years who is as good as dave mccall
8642616 weve been around strikes before though we havent struck ourselves so its new in putting that effort toward getting a contract
8642617 weve been through a heck of a lot of pain and a great deal of sacrifice for so many people i always blamed the government for not enforcing our trade laws when they said they were going to creating a situation that almost resulted in a total demise of the steel industry
8642618 now that the industry has rebounded we should be able to restore some of the sacrifices and ease the pain bestowed on our retirees and our members
8642619 you try to help in bad times you expect when things are good that you deserve fair and decent benefits
8642620 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8642621 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8642622 these kind of meetings are invaluable to me this is a chance for me to understand fully the concerns and frustrations of the people opposed to the application i talk to my staff about the issues but this allows me to talk to the area residents
8642623 the apex landfill is now foremost in my mind but at this point i dont know what i am going to do i am the person who will make the ultimate decision on the permit application but i will base my decision on the facts my staff recommendations and the local community
8642624 the odor issues that affect all of us at one time or another it all depends on where the wind is blowing from we want to know what constitutes a public nuisance
8642625 you call and say it smells bad i need an objective confirmation i need my staff to confirm the smell was bad and its bad on a regular basis i have yet to see a landfill that doesnt smell landfills are going to have odors but if they come and go thats not a public nuisance
8642626 i cant have coffee with my wife on our porch i cant have a cookout with my friends i cant have my grandchildren come out to visit because it depends on which way the wind is blowing
8642627 we have issued four violations to the landfill and they have challenged two of them those challenges are still pending before our board of health
8642628 all calls will be recorded we will have a staff person answering the phone during normal business hours and our answering service will pick up the calls after hours when a complaint is called in it will be referred to a staff employee
8642629 bigger trucks larger bulldozers supposedly to make their operations more quiet but it was all a ruse it was all designed to make their operations more efficient and in spite of everything i have not noticed an odor difference
8642630 because they are now working in a hole at the landfill but if they are allowed to expand vertically and that landfill grows up the smell will be really bad and you will be able to see it from the fort steuben mall
8642631 why not have them install video cameras at the landfill so your staff can watch or look at video of the operations the odor is controllable whether it is reducing the tonnage a day or burying the waste on weather suitable days
8642632 i dont sleep well at night when no one is there to check on what is being brought into the landfill people who never complained about the odor are now complaining
8642633 we are not a bad bunch of citizens we are asking you to help us this landfill is not going away they arent taking in their allowed 5 200 tons a day and now they want permission to bring in 10 000 tons of solid waste a day we will be turning this problem over to our children and thats not right
8642634 if this was a farm putting out that odor that farm would have been shut down just like the state shut down buckeye eggs because of the smell
8642635 i am not here to make promises tonight i wanted to listen to you you are looking at the person who has to make the final decision i will take everything i heard here into account and it is very likely i will be in contact with you folks i may just show up at your homes unannounced i have done that at the landfill
8642636 before i decided to purchase a franchise i was a fastframe customer ive seen fastframe from both sides of the counter

8642672 the coercion of the biblical text occurred in different ways often matching the unique personalities of each interpreter but theirs was always a stance of reception in every case the scriptures were the vehicle for the transformation of perspective
8642673 the bible begins with gods free affirmation free revelation of himself in the beginning out of freedom out of nothing god created the heavens and the earth this is the comfort with which the bible addresses us who are anxious before the false void the beginning without a beginning and the end without an end it is the gospel it is the resurrected christ of whom one is speaking here god is in the beginning and he will be in the end the fact that he lets us know this is mercy grace forgiveness and comfort
8642674 what a different vision from that of gunkel were they even reading the same text
8642675 was a new perception of the reality of god and a fresh grappling with the substance of the bible as providing the true content of the christian faith
8642676 this is the point where i started having trouble last time
8642677 im ready to come home this has been a great experience but i will be glad to go home we were finally able to eat dinner about midnight last night it is always a very busy day filled with meetings and events
8642678 to one fantastic evening as senator barack accepts the nomination for president of the united states
8642679 i plan to attend the democratic womens caucus today and we have already been told we need to be at invesco field by 1 p m where senator obama will officially accept the nomination later
8642680 because that is what the voters of the 6th congressional district elected me to do earlier this year
8642681 we had to cast our ballots earlier in the day wednesday and then i was unable to attend the caucus of clinton supporters because we had to be in our seats at the pepsi center i learned later that she officially released her delegates at the caucus but i let my ballot remain as is
8642682 when the official roll call vote of the states started i watched california pass then illinois pass and then hillary stood up at the new york delegation and asked for the nomination for barack obama be done by acclimation and that is when the place really went wild
8642683 hillary is such a gracious woman with a lot of class i am proud to have supported her and am looking forward now to supporting barack obama 100 percent
8642684 these have been very long days this week but when you are on the convention floor and hear great speeches by sen joe biden our vice presidential nominee and former president bill clinton and see all these people working for the same cause it just lifts me up last night was truly magical
8642685 i thought president clinton gave a fantastic speech pointing out that hillary and barack have the same goals for america they both have the same objectives
8642686 i have been wearing my democrats for life button and was approached by a woman wednesday night and she said she liked the button and agreed with me i talked to some other people who didnt agree with my position but we had a very civil discussion
8642687 this time we expect at least 30 area employers to be at the job fair to interview people interested in a job more information is available through our web site at
8642688 we will be reimbursed through the job and family services department once we determine how many veterans take advantage of this training program
8642689 we also served 5 510 child lunch meals as well as 1 376 adult lunches during the second quarter we work to ensure children receive balanced and nutritious meals five days a week in accordance with state and federal day care licensing laws
8642690 i respected the man i just didnt like the fact that it would be the receivers fault and never his fault its always the receivers fault

8642697 a wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the bread which it has earned
8642698 with respect to the words general welfare i have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers enumerated in the constitution connected with them to take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its creators
8642699 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
8642700 i cannot find any authority in the constitution for public charity such spending would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of the constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the union of these states is founded
8642701 federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character
8642702 i feel obliged to withhold my approval of the plan to indulge in benevolent and charitable sentiment through the appropriation of public funds
8642703 we must always ask is government working to liberate and empower the individual is it creating incentives for people to produce save invest and profit from legitimate risks and honest toil is it encouraging all of us to reach for the stars or does it seek to compel command and coerce people into submission and dependence ask these questions because no matter where you look today you will see that development depends on economic freedom

8642706 as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee biden is well versed in policy debates and carefully choreographed trips but his record on the islamic republic of iran perhaps the chief national security threat facing the next president suggests a persistent and dangerous judgment deficit
8642707 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community throughout his career senator biden has consistently been wrong on iran and his voting record on israel has been inconsistent like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons biden has continuously demonstrated poor judgment on iran he has voted against significant legislation that would pressure iran to stop pursuing nuclear weapons biden has failed to recognize the serious threat that iran poses to israel and the us and its allies in the middle east
8642708 iran is not a nuclear threat to the united states of america
8642709 the jewish community was already gravely concerned with senator obamas naive understanding of the iranian threat an obama biden ticket has proven that it is ill equipped to deal with this threat by selecting senator biden to join his ticket voting for senator obama has now become an even greater risk

8642718 these groups have used bizarre interpretations of the bible to justify their racist beliefs in much the same way that white supremacist groups have
8642719 what is most worrying is that their talk has grown increasingly militant in recent years with predictions of a bloody demise for white people and a whole host of other enemies
8642720 every white person who doesnt get killed by christ when he returns is going into slavery
8642721 reports on anti semitism on university campuses including strains that originate on the political left

8642738 i have just agreed to write a movie for sony and producer scott rudin about how facebook was invented
8642739 i could have stayed down south but when gary asked me if i wanted to join up for training in pre season it was a massive incentive for me
8642740 and trying to tell them that he would leave peacefully if they let him go
8642741 the guard walked up to reich and said what the fuck do you think youre filming and grabbed at the camera
8642742 that shits going to be on youtube we gotta get that tape
8642743 hes running through traffic dodging cars on peoples hoods as two guards are chasing him
8642744 hes saying please help me please help me with two or three security guards running through traffic trying to catch him
8642745 they were running after him saying thats the guy with the camera
8642746 i cut across and headed that way thinking he will prevent these guys from taking my tape
8642747 i knew that then at least wed be able to get the tape later
8642748 i figured theres no way that the security guards are just going to assault this random dude in front of a cop
8642749 it landed within five feet of me i leaned down to pick it up and i got tackled by two of the dudes they threw me into that ivy covered wall and i was trying to get them off me at one point there were three guards on me i threw the tape to sean and thats when it got really ugly
8642750 he hurled him into it then threw him onto the ground at this point there are two or three officers there
8642751 they beat the shit out of him in front of a cop
8642752 i am not going to give you evidence to help you back up your story
8642753 supposed to help during the immediacy of an incident and are directed to contact on duty officers if it is determined to be necessary
8642754 theyre basically to stay within the venue itself and if anything rises to the level of serious incident they are to contact the police

8642761 the governor has said its going to be the greenest transportation package weve ever seen
8642762 we need to figure out how to keep some of those measures under control
8642763 i thought he did a good job last season for us and under the right circumstances we might be interested in keeping him
8642764 thinking i could save time i rigged a beam with a pulley at the top of the house and a rope heading to the ground
8642765 i hung on the rope and halfway up i met the barrel coming down receiving a severe blow on the left shoulder
8642766 halfway down i met the empty barrel now coming up receiving several cuts and contusions from the sharp edges of the barrel at this point i must have become confused because i let go of the rope the barrel came down striking me on the head i woke up in the hospital i respectfully request sick leave

8642780 there is this coach that nobody really knows hanging around a lot lately
8642781 we call him the reaper because some of our good friends have gotten called over to him and then we never see them again
8642782 i dont know whats going on its hard for me to feel like im getting an opportunity to make the team when i dont get to play physically im doing fine and feeling fine everything is working but i have not had a snap at center or guard im kind of worried but everyone says not to worry
8642783 guys that have been around and have played the last couple of years keep on telling me that i have to stay focused be ready to take advantage of that opportunity when it comes around
8642784 we have this one tradition where everyone on the offensive line gets together for a pre game dinner at one of the better restaurants in whatever town it is that we are playing in
8642785 the guys are good to be around and the food is incredible
8642786 even though they know im not playing much my mom mary ellen my girlfriend katie budd my dad and my sister kelli make the 10 hour round trip drive to see me play in chicago you feel so depressed for not playing and then you walk out of the locker room and feel all of their support it just means a lot
8642787 it means a lot to me to know that he knows
8642788 there will be 15 more guys cut its definitely a stressful time especially when it seems i have no control
8642789 im hoping to get an opportunity tonight weve got meetings on friday and by then i should know if i have made it be it the team the practice team or neither
8642790 these next few days could be my last days of trying to make this team or it could be really something special
8642791 after the first two guys had finished their rounds we were seven strokes up
8642792 however after the second group completed their rounds we were just one stroke up it came down to our number five and six players and when b j rang his tee shot on the last hole off the clubhouse i thought we were in real trouble
8642793 the recovery shot on that last hole was the most difficult of the match
8642794 i thought we were doomed when b j hit his tee shot off the clubhouse the fact that he recovered for a birdie on that last hole is what golf is all about
8642795 the scores were a little higher than i would have liked but i felt we did well with the mixture of veterans and newcomers we have on the team this year mynderse will be a tough team to get around this year
8642796 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
8642797 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8642798 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either

8642816 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8642817 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8642818 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8642819 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8642820 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8642821 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8642822 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected

8642827 the impulse had rung out faintly within her for years like the occasional beep of a cell phone lost deep in an apartment
8642828 the two swollen halves of her upper lip drooped suggestively like a set of red velvet curtains tied at the corners of her mouth
8642829 wondering if she could possibly be pregnant in spite of the vestigial coil still lodged in her uterus like astronaut litter abandoned on the moon
8642830 oh i dont really like that color scent size style
8642831 that is kind of old do i dare put it on my face
8642832 im so sick of these stupid democrats thinking they are untouchable and the world revolves around them

8642834 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8642835 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8642836 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8642837 i wanted to make the film and the facts about the occupation of iraq accessible to a larger group of people my hope is that this will contribute to the process of making better foreign policy decisions moving forward in iraq and elsewhere during this election year its important to examine the leadership mentality and policies that caused iraq to descend into such a horrific state that after 4 000 american deaths at least a quarter million iraqis killed 4 million refugees and over 2 trillion spent iraq remains in a state of near collapse

8642873 tchit staat dicht bij een plaats in de basis ja maandag traint hij in tubeke voor de eerste keer mee maar ik verwacht geen aanpassingsproblemen hij kent veel spelers uit de belgische competitie
8642874 ik ben niet verrast geweest het was een positieve bevestiging van wat ik al wist

8642881 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8642882 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8642883 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8642884 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8642885 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8643004 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8643005 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that

8643010 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8643011 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical

8643082 i havent fought since april anticipating two more fights with bodog
8643083 i was exclusive with them for that period of time thats why i hadnt done any negotiations outside of that contract i was upholding my end of the bargain and dealing with them with integrity and honesty i was being forthright but they werent doing such it was very difficult
8643084 my contract was with sixth row productions bodog and sixth row intermingled funds i mean i could go after bodog fight but they have no assets they set up these shell companies and theyre not paying their fighters they dont honor their contracts it was very disappointing
8643085 the layoffs in question have actually taken place with a firm that provides bodog some software and marketing support but we are confident their service levels to us have not been and will not be affected
8643086 they want to pay people customers thats not the issue the problem is they cant find processing the processors are out there but none of them want to deal with bodog right now because they are considered such a high profile target
8643087 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry

8643094 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8643095 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8643096 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8643097 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8643098 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8643099 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8643100 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8643101 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

8643103 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8643104 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8643105 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8643106 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8643107 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8643108 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8643109 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8643110 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8643111 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8643112 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8643113 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8643114 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8643115 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8643116 it has the same character names and the same story line but adds the american flavor of the zoot suit hepcat era
8643117 some of the lyrics are the same some are updated
8643118 it reminds me of a uso show slapped on a traditional japanese tea setting the surroundings are formal but the tea is spiked with cayenne pepper
8643119 its jazzy but the basic comment about government is still there
8643120 it was controversial in their day the things they were exposing pushed buttons
8643121 this is one that has traditionally changed with the times
8643122 weve included people with cell phones in the theater on our list
8643123 we took free rein to add what contemporary audiences would understand
8643124 we told the designers to think of a uso show on a japanese set we used elements of japanese architecture and the color palette muted into the 1940s the swing dresses are created with fabrics with japanese patterns and florals the zoot suits baggy pants ties and hats look like kimonos that have been cut up and put on cuffs and accessories
8643125 it was about a japan that does not exist and never did its hard to do it traditionally now its so politically incorrect this version has the same story and the same flair and the same feeling of poking fun at itself it has the original language but the dialogue has been made better for our day
8643126 once you get the boys singing they are hooked forever those are the kids who go on to high school and college choirs
8643127 theres nothing like making music its a great deal of fun
8643128 we want to get a group of young guys together and get them excited about singing
8643129 our goal is to keep them singing offer them something more to do
8643130 it takes a lot of guts to sing in front of a group of girls and open your mouth and express yourself
8643131 boys have a lot of boldness we want to give them the opportunity to be themselves and work on their voices
8643132 when a group of men are singing together its a totally different atmosphere
8643133 when i was younger i didnt want to do choir i wanted to play sports just because thats what boys did
8643134 one of my hopes as a music teacher is to change the social stigma around choir for boys
8643135 its such an amazing experience you wonder how many people go by without having a positive experience in music
8643136 theyre kind of excited about having their dad be their conductor
8643137 you can start at zero and end with 1812 the list goes on and on
8643138 its such a different kind of atmosphere than the performing arts center
8643139 as long as people and families are having a good time and they promise us good weather were there
8643140 traditionally percussionists are very accustomed to taking a starter pistol and firing it into a trash can
8643141 when we first got together we were living out in california and our singer was from minnesota
8643142 and there was a highway 101 near where she lived so it was something we had in common
8643143 we dont have a big bus we dont have a crew its just four people getting out to play some music
8643144 then one day my dad had a party that he was playing and his bass player canceled
8643145 and he said look ive got this little gig why dont you come and play bass
8643146 we were cutting a record before they knew that cliffie was my dad
8643147 in retrospect if that hadnt happened we might have been brooks amp dunn or we might have been alabama
8643148 we didnt really have time to think about anything we were reacting to the stuff around us it wasnt like we were going oh i cant believe youre quitting the band we didnt do any of that she didnt get mad it just kind of happened
8643149 the perception of the extreme success we had at the beginning is paulette
8643150 because whiskey if you were a woman and the bed you made for me were songs paulette sang but nikki definitely brings something new to it
8643151 those issues are non partisan and we work both sides of the aisle
8643152 the party platforms are not focused on these issues and where they are theyre pretty similar
8643153 this is about celebrity youve never given any of us a chance
8643154 i would always tell kids to go to school study hard and get an education
8643155 you have to know who you are where you are going and why
8643156 pat goes out of her way to help others especially young people
8643157 i have never met anyone so genuinely concerned about people
8643158 too often we wait until someone passes on to honor their accomplishments
8643159 i helped coordinate this event to let pat know just how important she is to our community friends and family
8643160 i love doing things for the community and making a difference
8643161 i want to continue to work with kids and expose them to different people
8643162 i also want to get kids with talent to the apollo theater in new york to perform
8643163 it was good to feel the love from everyone there
8643164 she was very quiet and patient some of her friends and associates she grew up with and loved tried to take advantage of her
8643165 in contrast i was a fighter and was not scared to stand up for her
8643166 the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation
8643167 cash that check from our constitution guaranteeing our unalienable rights
8643168 found languishing in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land
8643169 greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation
8643170 the struggle conducted on the high plane of dignity and discipline
8643171 we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt
8643172 now is the time to make real the promise of democracy
8643173 now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley
8643174 now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racism
8643175 to the solid rock of brotherhood now is finally the time to make justice a reality for all of gods children
8643176 cross that warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice
8643177 we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream
8643178 which means act and act with your body to make every conflict a creative conflict
8643179 we need in every community a group of angelic troublemakers
8643180 i felt a large hit as i rolled down the thing i thought i was punched
8643181 i look up and i can see the suspect continuing to shoot at me and walking
8643182 he started coming back at me i started shooting him one handed i could tell i was hitting him because he started to wince
8643183 as he fell i grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him as close to me as i could he fell to the ground and rolled to his side and i fired three extremely close proximity shots to his head
8643184 im certainly not happy that you got put in that position that you were put into im not happy that you had to take the life of someone else and you have to live with that the rest of your life but i am happy that you survived this incident im really happy that you have the warrior mentality it takes to take a shot in the face and several more throughout the body and still do what you had to do

8643209 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8643210 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8643211 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

8643219 unquestionably the issue of poverty in all its forms and manifestations and one of its manifestations is homelessness has always been a dominant part of the lexicon of the democratic platform and principles
8643220 it will take a couple of years even after the national licensing goes into effect to clean it up
8643221 now that the economy is so tight for cash strapped consumers it is more important than ever for states to provide reasonable protection against rate gouging by small lenders

8643224 those we served before are dead and gone their departed spirits will never return
8643225 do not defile yourselves by turning to mediums or to those who consult the spirits of the dead
8643226 men and women among you who act as mediums or who consult the spirits of the dead must be put to death by stoning they are guilty of a capital offense
8643227 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through christ our lord

8643241 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these said albert an engineer who has always enjoyed tinkering with cars and applied online to participate
8643242 for some reason they picked me hydrogen fuel cells have been part of the auto industrys roster of advanced vehicles for years and several companies are testing small fleets they gained attention when president george w bush announced in 2003 that the government would invest 1 2 billion u s to encourage their development albert was among a small number of testers participating in project driveway
8643243 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
8643244 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
8643245 its allowed people to live with these vehicles in a way that they dont have to feel restricted in the distances they can travel or where they can go
8643246 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea

8643258 were going to feel like were in a regular college dorm
8643259 the options this board will face will not be pleasant
8643260 well have to start thinking in terms of what we can cut
8643261 this positive balance is actually on the backs of the bonds you issued
8643262 i think you have reached the pinnacle in increases in the reserve funds
8643263 there has been a lot of cutting already done in this budget it is conservative

8643268 its supposed to stay confidential and only be used for accidents
8643269 a lot of times its just very very difficult and very very time consuming to track someone down even with cell phones
8643270 everybodys got a cell phone its hard to find somebody who doesnt
8643271 its a rare problem now that we cant get a hold of somebody pretty quick
8643272 most people now have cell phones with them if we can look in the system well find mom dad
8643273 until the tif bonds are issued we really dont have the money to pay somebody

8643284 this kind of learning ultimately leads to an attitude where youre not afraid to pursue your interests its very liberating whe you realize that you dont need other people to tell you how to do something if you want to learn woodcarving well you can go get books and teach yourself woodcarving or physics or math or whatever the subject may be

8643289 we are going to go out and talk to shareholders
8643290 well encourage them to put pressure on wpp to up its offer
8643291 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8643292 i think im more in touch with the american people as far as my policies my proposals and my ideas
8643293 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8643294 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8643295 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8643296 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8643297 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8643298 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8643299 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8643300 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8643301 im health minister tony clement and i have to say i approved this food
8643302 the first thing i tell all our recruits is that for a program to be successful on the field the culture of the program off the field has to be a certain way
8643303 a team that values family respect and hard work will be successful
8643304 utah is one of the states that sets no limits on what lenders can charge
8643305 as weve learned in the meltdown of the mortgage market it costs not only the borrower but the community as a whole
8643306 i believe if folks using these products take the time to understand and decide whether its appropriate for them and keep it short term then i think those regulations and disclosure rules are adequate to protect people
8643307 in terms of protecting the citizenry the legislature as a public policy decision said that borrowing is not a right it is a privilege
8643308 it is up to the individual to make the judgment if the loan is in his best financial interest
8643309 and you would find virtually no one willing to lend you 100 for a week
8643310 but to a point you have to have some regulations to protect the consumer
8643311 the free market cant take care of itself without some oversight and regulation
8643312 i know that number sounds ludicrous but it would be a great victory for the consumer
8643313 we cant tell you that youll have to scratch the card to find out
8643314 its a bank they went through a lot of trouble to hire these people and make these scratch offs who knows they might be giving away something green what have i got to lose

8643321 the over the top response would suggest a station being overly cautious
8643322 and the majority of our international players already meet the standards of effective communication we expect we just want to make our expectations very clear while we are having a large degree of success we dont want to just stay where we are we want to get better we are looking to the future we are a global tour and we take pride in the fact the lpga attracts the very best golfers from all over the world
8643323 i support the direction in which they are trying to move
8643324 the objective of having foreign players spend some time making this a priority as golfers from strictly a commercial standpoint is a positive its going to open up business opportunities for the players that are not there now
8643325 if your child has the potential to be no 1 in the world it is not just enough to be a superstar in korea
8643326 you have to care enough about your sport and your celebrity to be a superstar around the world and not in just your little world hopefully parents will realize taking time to learn english is as important as that extra 15 minutes on the practice green
8643327 next year there will be lpga events in thailand singapore china korea and japan and the tour has said it has its eye on india and the middle east as well
8643328 will americans who win in those countries be expected to give their speech in the local language
8643329 we believe it is pretty clear that effective communication in english is really fundamental to our business
8643330 its pretty clear businesses and organizations have the legal right to establish a certain set of skill requirements
8643331 i dont think anyone is going to challenge it now
8643332 but if someone gets caught in this will they challenge it is this rule a net positive or a negative for the image of the lpga that remains to be seen there is no way to get around this policy generally but there will be some especially civil libertarians who will see it as really un american

8643335 on a related note mccain didnt know what kind of car he drives or how many currently owns
8643336 all kinds of things are going on that are pushing people into this slow food place
8643337 we dont want the slow food movement to be about celebrity chefs and fancy restaurants
8643338 this food gets lumped into its only for the people who want to pay the price
8643339 but you know people are willing to pay it on nike shoes and cell phones and god knows what else theyll pay it on
8643340 they dont see that if you dont pay up front you pay out back youre going to pay in your health and in the loss of your culture and in the pleasure of your life
8643341 you smell these flowers and lemon verbena and basil its intoxicating
8643342 you dont need the rhetoric you just need the plate of food

8643485 its prestigious but provides a platform for the players to go out and enjoy themselves zenits attacking play captured a lot of peoples attention last season so hopefully it turns out to be a really exciting and attacking game and i think it will be many people will make us favourites but that wont affect our preparations

8643550 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8643551 it was a moment i thought would never happen in my lifetime
8643552 he was nominated not as a black man but as a man who is qualified to do the job and that made me proud
8643553 im proud of my country im 63 i was refused buying a candy bar when i was 7 years old i have been refused trying to purchase a home in an all white neighborhood this is nothing short of a miracle
8643554 i can hardly describe how i feel i am so excited
8643555 when i think about civil rights activist medgar evers who lost his life registering people to vote we have come a long way in this country and we need a man like barack obama to lead us into the future
8643556 one of the greatest things that ever happened in my 86 years
8643557 i know medgar martin luther king and others never dreamed they would see this day forty five years ago we couldnt do this medgar was killed 45 years ago trying to get the right to be heard period
8643558 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8643559 when barack became her candidate he became mine it was difficult because it was a bitter battle between two qualified very talented candidates for presidency
8643560 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8643561 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8643562 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8643563 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8643564 and just in case youre wondering president clinton reminded us of what it is when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8643565 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks how insulting how pathetic how desperate
8643566 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8643567 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change
8643568 i want everyone to now understand why im so proud to have joe biden jill biden beau biden and mama biden with me on this journey

8643574 family members of shahbaz who used to run computer classes in lucknow were taken aback when up and rajasthan police reached his house in the night they seemed genuinely surprised by his arrest as they had no inkling of his involvement with subversive forces we have spoken to our counterparts in rajasthan and they say shahbaz had not disclosed his terrorist face to his family members

8643578 the women police manhandled us when we tried to question them using abusive language and hitting us they ransacked the place they did not allow us to even wear burqa

8643580 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8643581 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8643582 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8643583 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8643584 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8643585 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8643586 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8643587 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8643588 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8643589 because it crossed red lines that hezbollah had warned the defense ministry and army command
8643590 the party believes that the defense ministry and army command were not aware that military helicopters would enter the security zone as hezbollah has ongoing coordination and communication with both institutions
8643591 we expect scaled up support with reasonable flexibility to nepal in the coming days
8643592 we will do our best to use the assistance in priority areas and enhance our implementation capacity
8643593 we will also continue with reforms as long as they are proven best in the interest of the country even if they were inherited from the past or are new programmes
8643594 we have assured the donor community about our commitment on liberalized economy and democratic system of governance although some representatives said our economic programmes were somewhat ambitious
8643595 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i cant wait to get started again
8643596 i have always admired shaun and hes been a target of mine since i came to the club
8643597 another thing this season is trying to discern from all the girls out there the ones that are ethnically ambiguous girls and boys that have faces that you cant just put in a certain place or race or geography i think its very helpful to see those types of faces in our conflicted world because you can see that were still evolving as humans and they are the results of people willing to go beyond the socially constructed notions around race with the internet and the way that everyone is so connected now its not something you can overlook anymore i dont think its possible to do a modern show and have it be all blondes i understand that sometimes a designer has an aesthetic that dictates something like that and of course were going to work with them to achieve their goals but personally i dont find that to be a very modern statement
8643598 to initiate a movement to make people aware of the importance of outdoor games we are going blank for half an hour on sep 27
8643599 todays children are slowly shying away from outdoor games due to the advancement of technology and availability of several entertainment options at home and we being a childrens channel have taken the initiative to remind parents and children of the importance of outdoor games through our movement called lets just play
8643600 this is not the only thing we will be doing but we are also planning for a long programme to remind people about our movement from time to time we will be primarily targeting 20 major cities in india where we will be holding road shows and other outdoor publicity campaigns to endorse our movement
8643601 justice r p sondurbaldota has remanded the matter back to the sessions court
8643602 our nation is in trouble on two fronts the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8643603 from the middle east to africa to latin america to central and eastern europe the us administration had failed to use the power of diplomacy
8643604 you walk up to kids today and you ask them about global warming and issues like that and half of them look at you and think whats that thats sad because you know they dont know whats going on and whats going to happen if we dont start working on this issue now
8643605 the green quote selena gomez wants youth more involved with global warming
8643606 because there were likely to be a lot of young people there

8643608 barack obama ha un piano economico che mira a rendere il sogno americano a disposizione di tutti ed per questo che egli deve arrivare alla casa bianca

8643614 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8643615 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8643616 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8643617 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8643618 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8643619 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
8643620 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning
8643621 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes
8643622 we reasoned that if subjects were unable to correctly perceive any difference between the masked cues then they were also unable to build conscious representations of cue outcome associations
8643623 the ventral striatum responded to subliminal cues and to visible outcomes in a manner that closely approximates our computational algorithm expressing reward expected values and prediction errors
8643624 we conclude that even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making

8643627 i personally would encourage them that having people from their church build relationships with their friends who do not attend church and invite them as their friend would be a much better strategy
8643628 they are appealing to the natural corruptions in unbelieving people the bible warns very explicitly about the dangers of greed the love of money being the root of all evil
8643629 appealing to the selfish motives of people is not christianity
8643630 we canceled services that day and said our service to the community will be our service
8643631 this wasnt a gimmick hey come to our church there was no bait and switch we didnt try to convert people we just wanted to show we care
8643632 there are a lot of worse things that people can be doing in life than getting people to come to church
8643633 are they being tempted to think the church is about such gimmicks and external rewards
8643634 the amount of time ive spent being interviewed about all the good things were doing and only hearing about the gas thing on the news is a little disappointing

8643648 and president clinton reminded us of what its like when you have a president who actually puts people first thank you
8643649 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president

8643652 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership we need
8643653 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam
8643654 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8643655 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8643656 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks
8643657 for last seven years the administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century the emergence of russia china and india as great powers the spread of lethal weapons and resurgence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan
8643658 our country is less secure and more isolated than it has been at any time in recent history the bush foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8643659 i think my game picked up today because i putted really well i made a 20 feet putt for birdie on the sixth i also had a couple of great shots on the second and the 13th on the par three second i made birdie thanks to my tee shot which ended up one foot short of the hole on the 13th i chipped in from the bunker for birdie if i continue to putt well over the next two days i feel i have a very good chance of winning here

8643669 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8643670 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8643671 so why did elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall to levels similar to the pre industrial era that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years

8643702 the u s has aggressively looked for opportunities to repatriate detainees
8643703 in countries where we know they have a program to rehabilitate detainees like saudi arabia weve had good success
8643704 what you have is a situation in which the u s wants to get all the saudi prisoners to saudi arabia because the saudis know how to deal with them
8643705 when it comes to sending people back home there is really no way for us to find out how they are doing

8643763 we dont know if someone has been firing in the woods and accidentally hit the cat but they should not be doing that as they could easily hit a child
8643764 if it is malicious then it is really sad and hopefully the police will catch whoever is responsible
8643765 we have had up to three times the average rainfall this month
8643766 so the ponds that dried out in early summer killing the fish and other invertebrates will have been drenched in august flushing away the salt water to make the ponds much fresher

8643771 for too long the federal government has tied the hands of state governments that wish to permit oil and natural gas leasing in their adjacent offshore zones congress should remove the moratoria on offshore gas production and share the federal royalties with the states that decide to allow offshore production just as they share the royalties from production on federal lands with the states

8643783 14 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
8643784 22 and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son in thee i am well pleased
8643785 13 and he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of satan and was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered unto him
8643786 2 and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterward an hungred
8643787 28 and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights he did neither eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the ten commandments
8643788 18 yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him
8643789 2 being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered
8643790 13 and he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of satan and was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered unto him
8643791 3 and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread 4 but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
8643792 5 then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple 6 and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone 7 jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
8643793 8 again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them 9 and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me 10 then saith jesus unto him get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve
8643794 7 jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
8643795 10 then saith jesus unto him get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve
8643796 21 from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day 22 then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee 23 but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of god but those that be of men
8643797 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour 9 whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world
8643798 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places
8643799 16 above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
8643800 35 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of reward 36 for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise 37 for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry 38 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him 39 but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul
8643801 22 and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into abrahams bosom the rich man also died and was buried
8643802 26 and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations 27 and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father

8643805 oil markets are waiting for gustav and waiting to go on holiday
8643806 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8643807 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8643808 gustav is on track to pose a sizeable threat to both upstream and downstream production capacity
8643809 the impact of gustav on the downstream sector could be felt more acutely at least in the short term as there is no u s government inventory that can be released
8643810 it looks as though the hurricane is on track to inflicting damage
8643811 it would be very difficult to be in a short position today and tomorrow
8643812 there is the u s labor day holiday on monday and the market will be shut theres a lot of nervousness
8643813 its gotten to a point where the volumes are just reduced and the production is not there to keep everyone working all of the time so weve had to make the decision to assess our workforce and conduct some layoffs temporarily until volumes and customer demand go back up
8643814 i dont like long drawn out things and thats why im doing this effective friday
8643815 gene has grown the leaf chronicle into the local news and information leader that it is today
8643816 his commitment to the clarksville community and to the leaf chronicle has been obvious throughout his career
8643817 clarksville is a better place thanks to his contributions to the newspaper and the community
8643818 the leaf chronicle has flourished under genes leadership his dedication over the years has extended beyond clarksville as gene has provided leadership throughout tennessee
8643819 a few months over 45 years are enough for anyone to be in one place
8643820 i dont think i have overstayed my welcome but its time for me to hang up my newspaper tools and pick up a rod and reel
8643821 and i want to thank each of you who have somehow played a part in my life as i reflect on the years i realize that what i have accomplished is pale compared to what needs to be accomplished in this world
8643822 its been a great run and lots of fun my wife ann and sons ben tom and jon appreciate all the friends we have made and the support we have been given by leaf chronicle employees readers and advertisers over the years
8643823 you are one of the finest groups of employees in the gannett company you have gone beyond the call of duty many times and you have never let me down the future is for you to determine the past is for reflection on pleasant memories
8643824 the leaf chronicle is 200 years old there were 20 publishers before me i dont believe newspapers are dead and there will be 20 people after me i dont think quite frankly that the readers or advertisers will be able to notice any difference in the leaf chronicle after im gone and hopefully without sounding boastful i think thats one of the marks of a good leader
8643825 but the printed product as we know it today i dont think youll see its demise certainly not in my lifetime it may change shape size or form but i think it will always be there
8643826 the tornado and the eight to nine months that followed it was by far the most exciting and rewarding thing id ever been part of

8643828 i worked at the trane company got mad and quit and needed a job i had three hours of journalism credit from austin peay state university and had been in a pre law curriculum
8643829 so i went out and wrote a story on the cunningham bridge glover williams who worked in the composing room put it in the paper without the editor at the time even knowing it
8643830 my first story was about the consolidation of schools they never did tell me to go home so i stayed
8643831 i always knew gene was going to stay there until he got too old to go to the bathroom by himself
8643832 seriously i liked his work ethic he was one of the hardest working guys ive ever been associated with he always had the newspapers advertising customers and readers foremost in his mind he was a newspapermans newspaperman
8643833 gene understood about tailoring your services to specific media markets and responding to what your customers want he knew that what might be a good fit in one community might not necessarily work in another
8643834 back when he was a sports writer gene was known as mr wisher and he always did an outstanding job in writing local sports
8643835 on a personal note one thing ill never forget about gene is his resolution to never hold a meeting for longer than an hour
8643836 having said that they did well where it matters td canada trust put in a better result than we expected and u s banking was better than their own guidance

8643904 i believe this position can be defended scientifically far more effectively than the pro abortion position that life begins at birth
8643905 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
8643906 i spoke directly with an associate vice president in the legal group this afternoon and unfortunately the adoption will not be possible as per state law and university policies regarding property animals can be transferred to other institutions for scientific purposes via the mta process but it is illegal to transfer them directly to an individual

8643909 once again threatening to launch a new attack on lebanon forgetting that the israeli occupation was the core of the problem for lebanon and the region
8643910 the zionists will think not one thousand times but tens of thousands of times before they attack lebanon
8643911 the first shot fired from the zionist entity toward iran will be met by a response of 11 000 rockets in the direction of the zionist entity this is what military leaders in the islamic republic iran have confirmed
8643912 the lebanese get diplomatic recognition and the syrians get recognition of vital interests in lebanon
8643913 my job as president is to make sure we are tightening the screws on iran diplomatically to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a different calculation
8643914 and we have got to do that before israel feels like its back is against the wall
8643915 we have to act much more forcefully and effectively on the world stage to contain irans nuclear capabilities
8643916 the problem is that for most of the bush administration instead of trying to engage directly with iran there was a lot of saber rattling
8643917 the net effect of demanding preconditions that iran rejects is this we get no results and iran gets closer to the bomb he said in a july media statement
8643918 obviously there is more that needs to be done both sides continue to have work to do
8643919 it is something that abu mazen pa chairman mahmoud abbas brings up each time we meet it is something that matters a lot to the palestinian people
8643920 i think it is an opportunity for guys in the one day team to push for selection whether it be the test matches in india or the australian summer
8643921 we have so much cricket coming up and unfortunately there are only 11 spots theyve picked 14 to go to darwin so there are a few guys pushing very hard for selection there
8643922 at the moment were putting out the strongest team weve got injury and personal circumstances have come in but for us this is the best side weve got on the paddock
8643923 its up to the guys who come in and take the reins including myself to put their hands up were all looking forward to the challenge
8643924 we want to win every series we play in it doesnt matter who were playing we want to win and win convincingly

8643933 anyone who lives near the beach and is susceptible to storm surge needs to know where they might evacuate
8643934 as early as it is i wouldnt panic but youll have to wait a few more days to see where its going
8643935 it is too early to tell but for the next couple of days were going to be watching it closely
8643936 with it being a holiday weekend they dont need to let their guard down they need to pay attention to the news reports
8643937 all the hurricane preparedness that people talk about should be implemented now
8643938 nobodys out of the woods we have a large cone of uncertainty so theres a lot of room for error
8643939 its just too soon and too far out to know where it will make landfall
8643940 theres a level of fear out there that i havent heard before
8643941 were throwing our plans in place like its going to hit us
8643942 and its only 20 minutes to both of our jobs i feel a lot safer up there i used to leave for every storm and now i wont leave unless its another katrina
8643943 the really good part is that the people in picayune and pearl river county have more choices of where to buy things

8643949 i think it matters in some cases depending on the position
8643950 ive been at a few other teams where in this game there have been players that have done something very well and merited making the team the evaluation isnt over
8643951 it will basically end when the game ends thursday night and then its time for us to get our roster down as best we can were trying to gather all the information we have on these players and give them the fairest opportunity to make this team i think thats the only way you can do it
8643952 i wouldnt want to elaborate whether a player is safe or whether hes involved in discussions but certainly were evaluating all of our players for this final roster
8643953 im just looking to see from palko some consistency and eliminating some of the minus plays
8643954 id like to see him put a few good series together hes going to play a lot ive said that hes going to play about two thirds of the game
8643955 its not raining there are light breezes basically were all in standby
8643956 but my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8643957 they were all members of a family who had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8643958 we notify the state fire marshal any time we have a fire fatality
8643959 the states very adamant about that since mississippi ranks as one of the highest states for fire fatalities we need to get a handle on it
8643960 it will make it more insurable and companies in the regular market will more likely be willing to write a home that has measures in place such as wind resistant windows roof strength roof covering performance roof to wall strength wall to floor to foundation strength opening protection and window door and skylight strength
8643961 consumers investing in effective mitigation measures may be able to get insurance in the regular market where they might not have in the past also keep in mind rates are predicated on risk and if you live in an area that is prone to hurricanes rates are going to be higher than other parts of the country
8643962 afghan national security forces ansf and coalition forces killed over 100 insurgents during combat operations in helmand province from august 25 to 28

8643964 heavy casualties were inflicted during fierce fighting between afghan soldiers and insurgents but the exact number of casualties is not known
8643965 twelve dead bodies of the insurgents were left on the battlefield
8643966 they want four more years in a just world they would get 10 to 20

8643998 for instance joseph biden comes off as a liberal democrat but hes the one who authored the bill that put me in jail he wrote the law against shipping drug paraphernalia through the mail which could be anything from a pipe to a clip or cigarette papers
8643999 we have not devoted nearly enough science or time to deal with the pain management and chronic pain management that exists theres got to be a better answer than marijuana theres got to be a better answer than that theres got to be a better way for a humane society to figure out how to deal with that problem
8644000 i have long regarded biden as an opponent of the cause for reasons like tommy says and more
8644001 but i was surprised when he was the one who introduced the 1 1 crack powder reform bill this year which leapfrogged the more modest reforms put forward by sens kennedy hatch and others im not sure whether to take it as a sign of a more general opening up on his part or just a play for the african american vote in the primaries but at least biden isnt entirely bad news for drug policy

8644010 our original goal and promise to members which we thought was very aggressive was to release one new database each day on worldvitalrecords com
8644011 looking back we have in fact averaged more than 21 databases each business day since our launch
8644012 i am very pleasantly impressed by what i have seen so far and have signed up for the two year subscription what clinched it for me was doing a search for my polish family name and being amazed to find a reference to my mid nineteenth century great great grandparents in an obscure digitized polish book which i would never never have found any other way please keep up the good work and continue to amaze me
8644013 i am very impressed with the progress that is being made on the amount of databases being put online for subscribers i found a book titled history of christian gnaegi which is one of my direct ancestors and i was very pleased to see that
8644014 i just wanted to let you folks know that you are doing a fantastic job getting so many records online it is unbelievable the amount of records in so short a time that are online at worldvitalrecords com i always look forward to seeing what new databases are going to be posted keep up the good work
8644015 honeybee health and sustainable pollination is a major issue facing american agriculture that is threatening our food supply and endangering our natural environment
8644016 haagen dazs ice cream is made from the finest all natural ingredients and the plight of the honeybee could mean many of the ingredients used in our top flavors like vanilla swiss almond and strawberry would be difficult to source
8644017 we use 100 percent all natural ingredients like strawberries raspberries and almonds which we get from california the bee problem could badly hurt supply
8644018 one third of our nations food supply depends on bee pollination but bees are vanishing in massive numbers this gift will help us to rebuild and revitalize our honeybee program
8644019 this is not an issue for us in the united kingdom as we source ingredients for our natural flavors in europe africa and the middle east
8644020 but we could eventually find ourselves in a situation where we would have to supply our own business in the united states with flavors and or ingredients if the honeybee problem becomes more serious
8644021 the library looks fantastic and usage has gone through the roof
8644022 the fundraising efforts focused community attention on the library so more local people are using it and the refurbishment has made it more attractive to tourist visitors
8644023 this made bankruptcy in the us a viable alternative to a uk insolvency and given the dollar pound exchange rate us bankruptcy was dramatically less expensive
8644024 candidly the charity simply did not have the funds to institute an insolvency proceeding in england
8644025 on its face there is nothing to liquidate and nothing available to fund an investigation in the uk
8644026 due to the relatively small number of assets the trustee did not feel that liquidation was worth his while
8644027 staff actively worked to prevent implementation of anything to do with change until the chains finances were too far gone for any change to have worked

8644033 were not trying to kill anything referring to a player comment that this would kill small guilds were trying to give guilds something to work for and feel proud of what does it say about a guild member that is going to abandon his guild for another guild with a hall either he isnt very loyal in the first place or wants a guild hall without putting in the effort to get it probably not someone id want to be guilded with anyway you could use the same argument about people leaving guilds for another guild that can help them get their mythical there will always be people out there that are in it for themselves and if a guild is made up of mostly these people they may have problems guild halls are meant to be a group reward and require people to work together to achieve we cant force people to do that but then again guild halls are a priviledge and we dont expect every guild to have one if you want it you have to work for it
8644034 this has always been the case whether its buying plat paying to level a character paying for a mythical etc
8644035 i think what youll see is small guilds being absorbed by larger ones or guilds merging to increase their numbers further as guild halls are given more and more perks and you know they will be there will be more and more need for players to belong to guilds with access to these halls what i am concerned about is that you are effectively creating an entirely different game for those in big rich guilds and those in small guilds or no guild at all couple this with mythical weapons and those at the higher end might as well be playing an entirely different game now balance new content for this wide disparity in power and ability can you what impact will guild halls have on the social aspect of the game if an entire guild can spend all their time in their guild hall or off in instances doesnt this effectively remove them from the game i am a bit concerned that my gameplay and that of my fellow guildmates will consist of logging in to our guildhall porting to the instance were raiding raiding for a few hours then calling back to the guild hall while never having to set foot in the rest of the world

8644053 then i read g r taylors 1950 book hamilton and the national debt which described the debate over alexander hamiltons plan to fund the new economy with borrowed money
8644054 the most revealing account was a speech by the first congressman from georgia james jackson on february 9 1790 in which he predicted that adoption of hamilton s funding plan would lead to the explosive growth of debt
8644055 loans created only the principal interest had to be paid out of principal so payment of interest reduced the money supply and slowed economic activity recovery could come only when new loans were taken out at least equal to interest paid
8644056 as long as the money supply of a nation is created as debt costing interest debt must grow by compound interest
8644057 we are buying more and more in the same amount of time witness the efforts of people to get rid of their excess through yard sales storage units and big trash pickup days and the massive size of what are euphemistically called landfills while two billion people in the world lack basics such as clean water food and shelter americans throw away their microwave ovens televisions computers refrigerators furniture and cars meanwhile acceleration is applauded as increasing productivity its like arguing that cancer is good because it grows

8644101 in fact the un special rapporteur philip alston has recommended the removal of ejk from the counter insurgency program
8644102 esperon has yet to cast off his militarist mindset of pacification and has yet to be made accountable for the extra judicial killings of a thousand activists
8644103 it appears that arroyo and the afp just went through the motion of prolonging negotiations and accommodating certain demands of the milf only to keep them from resuming its armed offensives but the regime does not seem to have made serious efforts to ensure that the evolving agreements are accepted by her allies the affected communities and the public

8644380 the workplace and schools and clinical providers were recognized as having a role to play but parks and recreation wasnt in there
8644381 we had been aware of and had been advocating for inter agency multidisciplinary partnerships between and among park districts and health related providers for a long time it just made sense
8644382 on average respondents reported that their agency was involved in an average of four health partnerships about two thirds of those surveyed reported they partner with schools
8644383 in rural areas it all comes down to three things money volunteers and knowledge youve got to know what to do have the ability to communicate and plan and there has to be a way to fuel the funding

8644397 gafcon is not just a moment in time but a movement in the spirit

8644414 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8644415 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8644416 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that

8644418 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8644419 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected

8644497 if it was me obviously id like every game to be on all platforms so id only have to buy one perhaps that could happened in the future but right now it doesnt
8644498 i see where you misunderstood me here im not advocating one platform there could be multiple platforms with all these unique features but games in generation would work or even just be released on all of them as an example say i wanted to buy the wii for its control and price id buy that and be able to get the whole library of games on it obviously the problem would be hardware but if there was a standard much like with the dvd i think it could work out fine i dont know could happened probably wont id like it to because i own the 360 and the ps3 and i desperately want to get rid of one but there are like three exclusives on each that pull me towards keeping them

8644515 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8644516 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession

8644524 the collection is a smart funny sad crazy making amazing wonderful set of pieces that had me nodding as i read the authors come from a variety of fields and a range of institutions this collection is well worth reading for anyone considering an academic career and also for any administrator mentoring faculty mama phd wont surprise anyone whos a reader of academic blogs after all there are lots of outlets these days for reading good personal writing on motherhood and academia and i wondered whether id find the essays redundant or compelling they were definitely compelling though i read quickly learning about the different ways institutions create barriers for mothers advancing in their careers or make it easier for those with children to advance these are eloquent accounts of what choices women have made to accommodate their kids and careers

8644526 this book has been described as one that should be given to all mothers in or thinking about entering academia i would also like to add for those who are thinking about leaving academia one of the strengths of this compilation and there are many is that it presents all sides those who have or are about to jump into the deths of academia those who are a making their way though it come hell of high water and those who have decided to leave it while some of the experiences recounted in this collection do tell of departments and colleagues that are supportive it also drives home the point that academia is just the same as almost all other industries mothers are not welcome with open arms however besides the negative aspects reading this book made me feel at home the passion i have for academia and the possibilities of merging ith with motherhood not ignoring the numerous challenges that it brings and that are transmitted in the book is what i wanted to read to help me see a possible future back in academia and becoming a mama phd

8644752 the drivers are becoming more comfortable with the cars and are learning the benefits of racing a tdi clean diesel engine equipped with a dsg transmission i think there is still room for some surprises from these young drivers in the second half of the season

8644763 from a historic standpoint the mobile revolution began in the90s with the mass adoption of mobile phones as a primary means of communication mobile e mail became a way of life in the enterprise as consumers and professionals became more familiar with mobile devices and as mobile devices became more like mobile laptops end users increasingly desired and expected to be able to do everything from the mobile devices that they could do from their desks

8644772 ethiopia remains apprehensive because the tfg is not viable its not functional and its not helping them and the insurgency is gaining a new edge

8645020 die produzenten hatten angst dass das publikum keinen italiener als westernhelden akzeptiert sie wollten die leute glauben machen dass sie sich einen amerikanischen western anschauen doch sie irrten sich denn die ringo filme wurden ein gro er erfolg beim n chsten western gab man mir meinen richtigen namen zur ck

8645032 it paid off i put in the time then and did what they asked me to do and they gave me more opportunities

8645143 all of the places that i had ever coached before the coordinators were in the box
8645144 it gives them not only an opportunity to see the field better and see personnel groupings but it cuts down one extra communication between someone in the box to somebody on the sidelines to identify what the other teams personnel is getting into
8645145 last year former defensive coordinator chuck pagano chose to be on the sideline because it was our first year and he was so familiar with our defensive package and at that time linebackers coach tommy thigpen and some of the other coaches werent as familiar with some of the adjustments that might have been necessary had chuck have stayed he would gone upstairs this year
8645146 although theyre still young guys youre still talking about those 15 true freshmen and some of the red shirt freshmen the two deep guys notice how much better the scout team look is
8645147 a year ago our scout teams were pretty much comprised at least 50 percent or more by walk ons thats not to diminish the fact that walk ons are very important and we love having them here but its really helped the preparation significantly
8645148 i have some nervous anxiety about it just from the standpoint that you know as a coach how critical the kickers are
8645149 theres probably going to be anywhere from 15 20 kicks during the course of the ball game of some nature and every one of those is so critical theyre such big plays in a ball game that you want to be perfect on extra points and youd love to be 100 percent on field goals inside the 42 yard line
8645150 the kick that they go in the game for is the only one they need to worry about
8645151 dont worry about the past one dont worry about the next one and dont worry about the next game and whoever is there kicking we expect them to perform and to do well
8645152 i think that they will get better as the season goes along and as they get comfortable

8645166 i got to know viktor schauberger in vienna in 1930 when he attended one of my lectures he talked about his activities showed me apparatus he had constructed and allowed me to drink of the water he had purified in september 1935 his first essay on regulating the rhine was published in my periodical tau and was followed by many others until the banning of my periodical by the hitler government in 1938 for me it was a great gift to have had the experience of knowing this able researcher and fighter he was a man who had a close to nature originality he had piercing eyes a prominent aquiline nose an upright bearing and a flowing full beard how sharp was his power of observation and also his judgement how to the point were his answers how heartily he could laugh new ideas tumbled out as clear water from a forest spring to his friends he was a trusted comrade he gave to all strength calmness confidence like the mountains amongst which he lived in a superior way and unafraid he served the truth and did his duty in july 1936 he wrote to me he who lives a hundred years in advance is never surprised with the present a hundred years what will not happen by the year 2000 the wrong kind of progress will no doubt continue but at the same time forces will emerge even to be accepted by governments as a healthy renewal may they soon contribute towards the realization of schaubergers vision of the future as of a prophet and what he fought for during his whole life
8645167 it is often said that ones first impression is the most reliable after reading in the 1930s some of viktor schaubergers papers on the necessity of allowing water to flow naturally i met him personally for the first time during the summer of 1942 we both took part in a conference at which he held discussions with scientists of the old school even today after more than thirty years there is above all a particular memory which persists his unshakable self confidence and inner conviction of the correctness of his theories he countered all objections with what could be described as an air of superiority and authenticity which deeply impressed all his colleagues one had the distinct feeling that here spoke a man endowed with an inner perception before whom the elements of nature and the structure of all life are unveiled and in their correct order my many discussions and considerable correspondence with viktor schauberger were principally concerned with the natural measures to ensure water economy for agriculture and forestry in the pursuit of knowledge in this field i had met many people but never before had i made contact with someone who could throw such clear light on often very complex problems and who the more i got to know him won over my complete trust

8645219 there has been no decision on the matter but these discussions have been ongoing for some time theres nothing new about them

8645222 induction motors operate by locking the rotor to the rotating magnetic field of the stator most loads do not require the magnetic field to be at full strength to achieve the desired mechanical power output lowering the input voltage to the motor with a variac is a simple test anyone can do to prove this principle most drill press motors will run quite well on 60 volts input cutting the voltage in half also cuts the current in half which cuts the power input by 75 once the motor is power factor corrected for this voltage the motor will appear to run on nearly nothing and of course that is the point i applaud hector for encouraging people to run these experiments the reactive power circulating in the lc tank circuits can be converted to real power using methods discovered by tesla but that is another matter entirely

8645228 as an ardent practicing catholic uh this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and uh senator uh im senator uh st augustin sic said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child uh eh er first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester the the theres very clear distinctions
8645229 the notion that the catholic church declared abortion a sin at the same time as the pill is patently absurd and shows that pelosi has either lied about studying the issue in terms of church history or lied about what she found
8645230 in our case a murder being once for all forbidden we may not destroy even the fetus in the womb while as yet the human being derives blood from the other parts of the body for its sustenance
8645231 the catholic catechism is extremely clear on the nature of its position on human life and has been remarkably consistent on this point for almost 2 000 years and it finds that position in the old testament
8645232 the process by which we let go of our hopes to make a difference for god and settle for making a living is subtle and gradual

8645408 the ship is the visible church whose history has been a voyage from its pristine perfection in jerusalem at pentecost through much contrary wind and violent storms persecution and false doctrine to its moral and spiritual wreck in rome that is in the roman catholic church those on board are a mixed multitude some resemble the centurion who believed the captain and owner of the ship church leaders more than those things which were spoken by paul while others even in the midst of darkness storm and fear listen to pauls teaching and are saved these also throw the wheat into the sea casting their bread on the waters that is broadcasting gospel seed far and wide the crew struggle to undergird the ship well meaning people who try to hold the church together by union schemes but they cannot prevent it from being wrecked from being broken into a thousand fragments

8645450 tout the youth shows as being for the greater good a public service but we always know its about the dollars
8645451 whatever gave kids a taste of what its really like and an opportunity to work with professionals whove done it for a long time and i was excited to work with myn having the star tribune as an outlet what more could you ask for as a young person interested in journalism now kids dont have that kind of opportunity
8645452 i feel grateful that in this day and age the show existed and that so many young people got to participate in it we did well with it

8645459 unfortunately the state of israel cancelled your performance in the country due to lack of budget and because several politicians in the knesset had believed at the time that your performance might corrupt the minds of the israeli youth

8645462 wiffiti allows the audience to stay actively involved in the discussion throughout the forums which puts our social media message into practice in a timely engaging way
8645463 the face of politics has changed dramatically throughout this election and emerging media technologies have clearly taken center stage
8645464 the outburst forum at the dnc gave us a chance to showcase wiffitis capabilities for sparking intense debates that extend far beyond the venue itself the forum panelists did an amazing job at propelling the digital conversation forward while still giving the audience control of the dialogue its so rewarding for us to see wiffiti used in this way
8645465 were fortunate to be involved in both the dnc and the rnc the democrats have gotten the majority of the buzz for employing emerging media in their campaigns so were proud to be opening up the social media dialogue to both parties

8645468 18 or 21 legalized age to drink debate lead to youthful over consumption
8645469 the legal age to drink in belgium is 14 but families begin allowing consumption even earlier our family dinners came with a choice of beverage beer or water and i dont ever remember soft drinks or juice being an option
8645470 we didnt drink as fast because of the late evening culture dinner with your parents began at 10 after which kids would go out but since the bars and clubs stay open all night there was no desire to slam down drinks public transportation was important during adolescence a period when kids learned to handle some of alcohols effects before getting their drivers license at 18

8645472 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8645496 the eu27 population is projected to increase from 495 million on 1 january 2008 to 521 million in 2035 and thereafter gradually decline to 506 million in 2060 the annual number of births is projected to fall over the period 2008 2060 while at the same time the annual number of deaths is projected to continue rising from 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births and hence population growth due to natural increase would cease from this point onwards positive net migration would be the only population growth factor however from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change and the population is projected to begin to fall the eu27 population is also projected to continue to grow older with the share of the population aged 65 years and over rising from 17 1 in 2008 to 30 0 in 2060 and those aged 80 and over rising from 4 4 to 12 1 over the same period

8645505 entre a segunda metade dos anos 1970 e os anos 2000 a mudan a clim tica foi respons vel por aproximadamente 150 000 mortes suplementares por ano ela atingiu de modo esmagador as popula es mais pobres segundo nossas estimativas os dados devem aumentar e ainda estamos considerando apenas uma parte das causas de mortes decorrentes da mudan a clim tica somente a parte imersa do iceberg
8645506 neste ritmo o n mero de mortos causados diretamente pela mudan a clim tica ficar em milh es daqui 20 anos
8645507 j temos um grande problema de mal ria e a mudan a clim tica vai torn lo ainda mais dif cil a temperatura influencia sobre a sobreviv ncia dos mosquitos e sobre os parasitas que transmitem a mal ria dos mosquitos em geral quando mais calor mais alta a taxa de infec o
8645508 em in meros casos a bact ria que infecta a gua ou o alimento sobrevive melhor a uma temperatura mais elevada mas o aumento do n mero de inunda es e sobretudo das secas vai contaminar as fontes de gua por exemplo em per odos de seca as pessoas estocam gua durante muito tempo e lavam menos as m os

8645515 everybody boils twice the amount of water they need so i decided i would find a way to boil water and make steam more economically
8645516 the principle is beautiful i have cashed in on a natural phenomenon and its all about music
8645517 if i hadnt been playing the saxophone i probably wouldnt have come up with the idea
8645518 the glasses will tinkle on one note knives and forks in the drawer will tinkle on another note and i realised that everything has its point of vibration
8645519 in the same way a component in the ball is tuned to a certain frequency
8645520 nowadays with the economy of water and electricity i think it could be even more important than when i conceived the idea
8645521 they could sell a million of the things in china
8645522 i cannot wait to explain the principle to somebody who wants to take it on
8645523 i dont know enough about sound to know whether you can transfer that amount of energy via soundwaves i doubt it
8645524 the resistance through the water provided the load i wonder if it isnt working like that without taking it to bits you cant tell
8645525 it is an interesting gimmick irrespective of how it works i would probably buy one as a gimmick i think more homework needs to be done
8645526 its rather spectacular i dont know why it has never taken off as a utensil for people i think its a class act
8645527 as a sensitive musician mr davey noticed that there was such a frequency of the motor and propeller buzzing when the aeroplane cabin and his body were getting into a resonance at this unique resonance frequency he always was experiencing an influx of heat in his aeroplane cabin

8645531 energy can be changed from one form to another but it is neither created nor destroyed
8645532 in all cases in which work is produced by the agency of heat a quantity of heat is consumed that is proportional to the work done and conversely by the expenditure of an equal quantity of work an equal quantity of heat is produced
8645533 the state of order in a closed system does not spontaneously increase without the application of work
8645534 among all the allowed states of a system with given values of energy number of particles and constraints one and only one is a stable equilibrium state
8645535 it is impossible to construct a device that operates in a cycle and produces no other effect than the production of work and exchange of heat with a single reservoir
8645536 the state of order in a closed system does not spontaneously increase without the application of work
8645537 energy can be changed from one form to another but it is neither created nor destroyed
8645538 britain is leading the way in getting rid of energy guzzling light bulbs and helping consumers reduce their carbon footprint
8645539 choosing energy saving light bulbs can help tackle climate change and also cut household bills with each bulb saving up to 60 pounds 85 euros 120 dollars over its lifetime
8645540 i am delighted that major companies have said they are prepared to help deliver this ambitious timetable and offer products which will help their own customers play their part in combating climate change
8645541 it feels great to be back from a spell overseas i really enjoyed being abroad
8645542 nothing beats the feeling of being a champion because i am coming back having won the play offs with cleveland so i am elated and grateful that i had a fruitful spell in the us which presented a different challenge all the same im also happy to be back at santos this is my home
8645543 i am looking up to meeting up with the squad on friday when i go down to the training session but i will probably start training on monday i did watch the loss to wits on television
8645544 though i am not attached to any club i am fully recovered i can feel i really need to get a chance at a club where i will do what i have always done
8645545 i last trained with wits to build up my strength and try to catch up on fitness ive been doing personal training and keeping fit with amateurs from the area in which i stay but i need to be with a more competitive unit now
8645546 i would not mind joining a first division outfit because during the nedbank cup i began to realise that some of them are just as good as their psl opponents
8645547 i love south africa very much and the people here have treated me nicely i always support bafana bafana when they play against other countries but this time they are playing against my country
8645548 to me my country comes first and i make sure that i give my best every time i get an opportunity to wear the national team jersey i will do the same when we play against bafana bafana
8645549 its going to be a tough game for us as bafana bafana are also desperate to qualify for the nations cup tournament in angola
8645550 we have already qualified for angola but want to maintain our unbeaten record in the tournament we missed the world cup in germany but this time we want to see ourselves in south africa during the world cup 2010
8645551 we are a big country and our people deserve to see us playing in the world cup in 2010
8645552 i want everything to be gradual i have been out for one year and i understand it will take time to get my rhythm back
8645553 the boys are in a positive frame of mind and we have no injuries serame letsoaka who has vast experience in this type of tournament has been in attendance to share his insight so we are well prepared you can tell the boys really want to play and achieve something judging by their body language
8645554 i understand the situation that i am in at the moment because management has been honest with me in explaining everything
8645555 the club has been busy applying for a permanent residence for me ive been in south africa for the past five years and so have been told that my application can be put through
8645556 i will have to wait about three months before i am eligible to be registered then i can start fighting for my place in the team again
8645557 this was a good performance from my players especially as for many of them it was the first time they were playing in the premier league
8645558 we are going to take one game at a time and try to collect as many points as possible we are not going to put pressure on ourselves by setting unrealistic goals
8645559 if you want to be sure of a player you have to use them first and that is all i did with those who have not been regulars for us in the liberty game
8645560 the other players need playing time too and games like this offers the best opportunity to do that
8645561 i want to upgrade myself and i think if i dont do it now i might never get the chance to do it again
8645562 the training opportunity in germany is something i cannot give up
8645563 a few different parties have been talking to us and showing interest but to do a deal one has to do a bit more than talk and show interest
8645564 when we know anything concrete we will let you know but at the moment there is nothing cast in stone
8645565 we are actually keener on bringing in new shareholders to give the club more financial muscle everytime big spending clubs like mamelodi sundowns or kaizer chiefs up their offers for our top players we have to fork out a few million rands to counter so the club is in need of financial strengthening
8645566 change in american cannot come from the top down but must come from the bottom up
8645567 it has been seven years what have you to say
8645568 a lady called to say that when she had gone to check on her property she had found that someone had emptied the heating oil out of the fuel tank
8645569 they could see tracks on the grass where someone had backed up to the fuel tank
8645570 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8645571 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8645572 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8645573 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8645574 the wind blew them down quickly so we need to make some money quickly

8645583 our manufacturing operations in asia have been running at capacity to satisfy demand in china
8645584 our outlook for sales and revenues this year still reflects another record year of growth in sales and revenues to caterpillar and for that matter for earnings
8645585 what is particularly impressive is that we have been able to sustain growth and strong earnings in the face of very severe recessionary conditions in our domestic market in the united states

8645589 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page if anyone has any questions id be happy to answer them as best i can if anyone has any comments im glad to listen
8645590 i have a fairly specific idea of what the first 15 pages of the screenplay will be and no idea what will happen on pages 16 through 130 i have very strong feelings about the internet and its effect on our national culture but frankly those feelings are being countered by the sophistication kindness curiosity and wit of the posts in this site

8645594 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

8645598 islam isnt in america to be equal to any other faiths but to become dominant the koran the muslim book of scripture should be the highest authority in america and islam the only accepted religion on earth
8645599 we are not fighting so that you will offer us something we are fighting to eliminate you
8645600 first chase out the invaders from our territory in palestine in iraq and everywhere in islamic land
8645601 second instal sharia islamic law on the entire earth and spread islamic justice there the attacks will not cease until after the victory of islam and the setting up of sharia
8645602 it is not enough to increase yield we must also increase the value of crops improve opportunities for farmers to access markets and increase income for rural businesses and entrepreneurs that support agriculture
8645603 mutual value is the key for moving african aid programs from only providing short term relief to actually becoming sustainable within the community
8645604 its at that point that we truly achieve success in improving livelihoods
8645605 we must leverage science based knowledge and research innovation in new and creative ways that build on the strengths of each sector to address the market and consumer needs of rural africa

8645612 we interact with the public throughout the day in front of the habitat
8645613 we talk about our training techniques and answer general questions about our elephants
8645614 when people can see and get close to an elephant or a kinkajou or one of the many other animals that we use in our programs it connects them to animals around the world
8645615 they see and appreciate whats in front of them and want to help the rest
8645616 i did pre surgical procedures x rays and helped the vets
8645617 i chose ud strictly for its animal science program thinking that i would like to continue working with animals i liked that as a freshman i would be able to immediately have hands on opportunities with animals
8645618 i really never defined where i wanted to work or what animal i wanted to work with specifically
8645619 but the zoo aquarium atmosphere was something that i wanted to experience and when the opportunity at busch gardens came up i couldnt think of anything better to think that i could be a part of such a wonderful team that uses positive reinforcement and is so involved in conservation projects was great
8645620 its very rewarding to be here at busch gardens and to be a part of efforts to increase the asian elephant population and bring awareness to the cause
8645621 the universe at its most basic level consists of tiny loops of string that vibrate at different frequencies
8645622 now this is also the same shape that living objects form and you find that all discharges in general of potential energy will try to form this shape you can see it in water patterns in sand and patterns in clouds in the sky the patterns appear over and over and over again just like the organic patterns burned into wood by the discharge of my tesla coil this is converted with the orgone right there this type of monopolar electricity is in such a form that it will grow into organic patterns a prelife pattern from the aether itself any type of energy like this such as a stream flowing down the side of a mountain a crack in a piece of window glass or fresh water percolating up through the sand all make these organic patterns based on the golden ratio any time you have energy discharging you find this type of pattern you can say there is a shape in space that is the log periodic spiral it doesnt exist in a tangible form because it is something that grows and decays its size fits the wavelength and frequency of the amount of energy to be discharged its not like you can map space to see this particular spiral but if you release energy into space then the spiral will appear
8645623 the experience will be perceived as extremely real because those functions of the temporal lobe that are recruited are the same ones that assign meaning and significance to experience in the first place
8645624 we had achieved a widening and deepening of the emotion they associated with the experimental experience
8645625 orgone energy is cosmic life energy the fundamental creative force long known to people in touch with nature and speculated about by natural scientists but now physically objectified and demonstrated
8645626 the orgone also exists in a free form in the atmosphere and in the vacuum of space
8645627 the orgone is related to but quite different from other forms of energy
8645628 streamings of orgone energy within the earths atmosphere effect changes in air circulation patterns atmospheric orgone functions underlie the buildup of storm potentials and influence air temperature pressure and humidity
8645629 in the living world orgone energy functions underlie major life processes pulsation streaming and charge of the biological orgone determines the movements actions and behavior of protoplasm and tissues as well as the strength of bioelectrical phenomena
8645630 some individuals have experimented with accumulators composed of buried metal boxes surrounded with rich dark soil free of pesticides and herbicides
8645631 in later years i began to wonder exactly what was the magic of these towers
8645632 except for the scattery island tower at the mouth of the shannon river all round tower doors are from nine to fifteen feet above the ground
8645633 half of science is in asking the right questions the right question was could the towers be some form of dielectric radio antenna for focusing lightning radio waves
8645634 in southeast asia and the philippines i had often noticed bamboo shoots growing during electric storms as if viewed by time lapse photography see a walk in the sun by the author
8645635 since round towers are not metal as are most low frequency radio systems then they had to be dielectric waveguide antennae for photon energy
8645636 our friend john tyndall discovered dielectric waveguides in water when he shone a light down a flow of water from a hose
8645637 something unique occurred while i was studying the sensilla under the microscope
8645638 impedance is a form of electrical resistance to current flow between two parts of an electronic circuit the impedance match between the wet cord and the stone tower was much better than i had ever thought it might be i was in for a delightful surprise
8645639 as i sat at the base of the beautiful glendalough tower trying to shield the scope face from the sunlight i began to notice waves coming in with a very peculiar pattern
8645640 another difference was that the side viewed outer waves were not evenly spaced as in a regular target wave but varied from narrow rings to rings that got wider and wider as they passed across the scope furthermore they came from a series passing in one or two seconds to one i measured at dog rock in australia that lasted four hours
8645641 in the old days 1946 4 when i was installing 300 khz radio range stations in japan during the occupation we usually had to construct a false ground of wire mesh six to ten feet above the real ground to keep the radio beams stable
8645642 i measured the glendalough tower at ground level no signal
8645643 the tower is constructed of mica schist and granite both paramagnetic the mortar of round towers is believed to be made with ox blood also making it paramagnetic
8645644 we may easily understand then that the paramagnetic forces of rock amplify not only elf radio waves in the atmosphere generated by lightning but also the photon waves generated in the infrared and visible control region of life life processes are electronic like the nervous system but also very much photonic lifes complex communication systems messages are carried by photons as are at amp ts
8645645 in summary every living human being is like a sponge in a bowl of jelly the atmosphere when the atmospheric jelly shakes elf waves then the jelly in the sponge also shakes at the same frequency the organic photon oscillators of our body superimpose their messages on this atmospheric brain body continuum think about esp
8645646 i spent the rest of the day measuring and plotting elf energy around glendlough round tower
8645647 i had discovered that round towers are indeed high tower elf radio antenna paramagnetic amplifiers more astonishing yet i discovered the ancient irish monks of the 5th to 9th centuries were rock antenna radio engineers
8645648 most round towers of ireland are now without floors or ladders however i was able to visit the tower on scattery island where the door is at ground level
8645649 the 8 hz and 2 000 hz waves always came in strongest at dawn and dusk i recorded the same elf phenomenon in so called megalithic tombs and even found a megalithic pictograph of a target wave on the side of the chamber at loughcrew
8645650 oh noes sfn is in columbia who will live blog
8645651 i realized that its ok not to want to do something
8645652 i have second and third thoughts and overanalyze nearly everything
8645653 so while things are not exactly perfect right now life is ok
8645654 years ago i used to think id never be happy
8645655 im still struggling with the idea of who i am and where im headed
8645656 i try not to obsess too much about the future just trying to enjoy the moments
8645657 i long for the chance to push the reset on my own life
8645658 i like to think in another life i own a small cozy cafe in the mountains somewhere
8645659 i feel like i am so many things and so few

8645662 wow this is a true tangible picture of gods redemption healing power and restoration
8645663 though you have made me see troubles many and bitter you will restore my life again from the depths of the earth you will bring me up you will increase my honor and comfort me once again
8645664 godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret but worldly sorrow brings death see what this godly sorry has produced in you what earnestness what eagerness to clear yourselves what indignation what alarm what longing what concern what readiness to see justice done
8645665 right now we are supporting the ps3 launch we are really excited to be bringing the bioshock experience to a whole new set of fans weve been concentrating on ways to make this game special the things that weve added theyre not changing the original experience that the 360 fans and the pc fans got but are things that compliment nicely that experience
8645666 the answer is no right now this is a ps3 exclusive
8645667 they are just trying to get the process started so they are in the position to complete an ipo when the markets improve
8645668 i was still driving and the department of motor vehicles sent me the stuff but i decided to give it up
8645669 hatch service roeding whitmore boothe and morgan all family names who went through ceres high
8645670 we also have a blaker kinser junior high and there are blaker and kinser roads named for families here
8645671 some appeared in the yearbooks over five or six years
8645672 theyd go to war come back and then finish school there was no age limit
8645673 he plans to be there for the centennial on the 13th and the homecoming festivities on the 12th
8645674 this is just not the right time or the right place
8645675 were struck by the tone and continued attempts to hide the reality of the charter law behind personal feelings and the hidden agenda of the district
8645676 i cannot see that this is in the best interest of the 10 000 plus students the district serves
8645677 our biggest frustration is that a majority of concerns could have been dealt with in honest communication
8645678 the rising costs of food fuel energy and utilities were taken into account during the preparation of the budget
8645679 however as costs from these areas continue to rise all school sites and departments have been asked to keep expenditures focused on student needs and necessary essentials only
8645680 between retirements and or moving on to other careers transfers or taking time away from the classroom no teachers were faced with layoffs this past year even with enrollment on the decline and a mandate from sacramento for all state agencies to cut budgets by 10 percent
8645681 i guess any time budget cuts come to a school district its going to be felt district wide
8645682 but there were no layoffs and the district did work hard not to have any teacher layoffs we do commend them on that
8645683 we understand the budget might get a little bit tighter next year but i dont know what the implications will be on that
8645684 to protect academic rigor stay away from the classrooms save as many jobs as possible and to be strategic and compassionate as cuts were made to ensure that we would be more effective and efficient in the delivery of instruction
8645685 i have always liked caring for people and i really enjoy science subjects so being a doctor seemed like a good way to combine the two
8645686 i know that to be accepted to do medicine you need to have an understanding of patients i did my work experience and a primary for disabled children and have been working at a care home since the summer
8645687 it can be challenging because you are helping people with different problems but it is also really enjoyable

8645691 i dont think a player should be able to play for two clubs in the same competition in the same season and i think we need to get the uefa strategic committee to look at the whole idea
8645692 i think that it is wrong that a player can play for two clubs in any competition scoring a goal for one team one week and then scoring against them a few weeks later
8645693 i also think we have to look at both the summer and winter transfer windows the season starts in many countries in july or early in august yet the transfer window does not close till the end of august
8645694 then we have another window in the middle of the season i think we need to look at the way the system works
8645695 we cannot force a young player to sign for his first club after that age
8645696 its because of the respect we have for them and the enormity of the challenge we have in front of us trying to win back to back south african test matches and in johannesburg for the first time in so long that we feel we need to bring in some fresh legs
8645697 last weekend took a lot out of our guys as it did some of theirs we will need the impetus that the fresh legs weve included today will bring
8645698 saturday still has huge significance in terms of momentum in the tri nations but also as far as the development of our group as a whole is concerned
8645699 by winning in durban last weekend we have presented ourselves with an opportunity to win back to back test matches in south africa which is not only rare in an australian context but also historically significant across the game in general

8645701 i was told initially she was a little uncooperative but then she was fine
8645702 oh no i really dont know where we are with each person on our target influencer and decision maker list
8645703 the defender would very much have liked to have been in the squad but told the coach that he fallen significantly behind in training over the last two weeks and was not in a suitable condition for the start of the world cup qualifying
8645704 when the voice of faithful artists engage with worship engage with culture and engage with the past present and future then the world is about to change
8645705 imagine a place where you are invited to ask big questions relating to how you think about god imagine being part of a diverse creative learning community who were all on a similar pursuit the institute provided a beautiful solid foundation of thought adding in building blocks which god is using to re construct some of my biblical worldview the whole process has personally been a surprising discovery adding layer upon layer of fresh insight this course has both illuminated old thinking and uncapped new thinking for me it has given back ground that was lost and also invited me towards new horizons

8645707 how many people do you need to keep your group down to in order to not be a mob
8645708 who are we kidding this is a waste of time today
8645709 the day before i started coaching murray i didnt know him at all
8645710 there was a big age difference and a culture difference
8645711 andy is very argumentative if he feels strongly about something a lot of people in his team gave into him i didnt so we would argue about sports mostly
8645712 he lives a quiet relaxed life focused on being a tennis player but he is obsessed with video games i dont play video games
8645713 people expect me to be bitter but im not look around and youll see how many coaches get fired
8645714 at mile 20 we ask ourselves why the hell am i doing this at mile 26 2 it all becomes clear
8645715 we are proud to align with mmc and i am personally thrilled that our programs will have a positive and lasting impact on healthcare providers within underserved communities in the u s and abroad
8645716 sharing world class medical education such as the programs produced by concept media are an important first step to sustainable improvement in the international communities we serve
8645717 our primary goal is to transfer medical knowledge from those who have it to those who need it most

8645731 ma ho qualche secolo pi di te e quando ero umano ero un soldato quindi mi dispiace ma non ce storia
8645732 ora scusa ma ho da fare prima che qualcuno scappi
8645733 we will get better little by little by the time the group games come around we will be ready
8645734 it is not easy when you have the pre season we have had when sometimes you are missing 10 players for a variety of reasons internationals or the olympics
8645735 then you have two or three players returning one week then the next week there are more
8645736 but now we have seen mascherano win the gold medal and liverpool have reached the champions league group stage so it has all been very positive in the end
8645737 now we have the players back and the confidence that we need to be successful this season
8645738 we will continue to improve we will be completely ready as a team when the group stages start
8645739 up until now we have been preparing for every game missing four or five players each time
8645740 now after a few players have returned we will improve with each match little by little we will improve to be ready for the big matches that will come
8645741 we are working to try to improve the squad it is not easy to bring in too many players at this stage with the window coming to an end maybe just the one will be all we can manage
8645742 we have been working and trying to improve the squad without thinking of the money from the champions league
8645743 we can progress if we have options but now with this money maybe it will be easier
8645744 for us it is important to be playing for trophies but of course the money is important but if you can win games like this it gives you the opportunity for more money we understand that
8645745 it was a very tough game and you have to give them credit
8645746 they have made it difficult for us over two legs but we have managed to scrape through when times are hard it is about sticking together showing character and trying to grind wins out and that is what we are managing to do
8645747 the most important thing is that we are through we did not give our best performance but kept working really hard until the end and i am really happy with another goal in europe
8645748 we wanted to play in the champions league because we know how good it can be we have been in a final and a semi final over recent years and we want more
8645749 first we had to win the qualifier and it was a tough game we believed in ourselves and even though it was not our best performance we always know we have the quality to score
8645750 were delighted that moritz has joined us and he will be in the squad for saturdays game at watford
8645751 hes a top professional who has spent his career in england playing at premier league level
8645752 he believes he is a premier league player and i believe that as well he will add some extra quality to the squad and is another step towards taking us where we want to be
8645753 i dont know if she was yelling a little bit or not
8645754 you put two adults with two teenagers in one bedroom it really wouldnt work out

8645768 rush let me ask you a question im serious about this this hurricane down there is brewing and if theyre right and this is very early their range of error is 300 miles four and five days out but the models are starting to coalesce on the mobile alabama new orleans area early monday morning two a m eight a m if this hurricane and a cat three cat four bears down new orleans while the republicans are in st paul i can just see obama and biden in new orleans sandbags going down and bottled water what would the republican party do do you think you know half the media would decamp st paul for new orleans is there anybody that youve talked to planning this convention thats putting together some way to deal with this
8645769 were really trying hard to make the city of toronto a more walkable much more comfortable city to walk in and search as well as without having to deal with traffic turning right or left
8645770 i guess its not a bad idea i guess that way youre not going to have j walkers and you know everybodys crossing its worth trying i suppose see if it works
8645771 it took me almost half an hour to get from the bottom of yonge street to up here today
8645772 we want to open up the convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party
8645773 i consider this to be one of the most important decisions i will make as governor because the supreme court justices make precedent setting decisions that affect the lives of all floridians for generations to come

8645783 the original tiddlywiki by jeremy ruston is without a doubt one of the most amazing dynamic web apps ive ever seen sorry gmail
8645784 what i love most about tiddlywiki is that it is quite easy to use but incredibly flexible
8645785 tiddlywiki is completely blowing my mind completely tripped out try it and youll see what i mean

8645804 we are honored to receive this acknowledgement by such a highly respected group like kmworld the award is a great validation of our development and marketing efforts over the last year and we look forward to debuting the latest release of isynergy at the kmworld conference
8645805 we screened sodium babies at this years cannes film market
8645806 it stood out among the numerous titles we previewed the picture has a graphic novel visual element similar to the movies sin city and 300 the story certainly has a crossover international appeal and we believe it will perform very well internationally
8645807 one of the great things about attending the world film markets is having the opportunity to discover terrific new talent the decaillon brothers are up and coming filmmaking stars we were blown away by their cinematic visual style and are thrilled to be representing this title
8645808 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses
8645809 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8645810 there are clearly economic benefits to being in a relationship such as shared bills lower rent and even reduced car insurance premiums the cost of being single can extend to thousands each year but with a little careful financial planning you neednt be tied to your partner purely for financial reasons
8645811 i promise the fight will not be easy and it wont go to the scorecards it will probably end between rounds four six i have a lot of presents ready for peter for october 11
8645812 i dont underestimate peter he is a good puncher i will give my best to be the winner to take my title back and to make history where two brothers will be champions at the same time its a huge motivation for me
8645813 vitali you never beat a champion you say you are the champion but you are not a champion you cant be the champion until you beat me and you cant
8645814 i am making one promise today i will knock vitali out trust me i will knock out vitali and then i will beat his brother there is no doubt about that
8645815 tara is more shy tara is more easily intimidated shes that side of me that was afraid of rejection that was afraid to take a chance and step up and have someone say no you dont get the role
8645816 i do still have that side of me that soft sensitive side and i think that carmen is the more aggressive part of me there are moments when i am so that little girl from cincinnati ohio and i cry and im just like everybody else you know i have all the same feelings that everyone else has
8645817 i really get a kick out of spoof movies for me its a chance to show people that i have a sense of humour and dont take myself too seriously
8645818 a lot of times i was the class clown in school ive always been that way if you cant make fun of yourself if you take yourself too seriously then you spend your life worrying all the time
8645819 power control is key to the mobile and network success if the ue requires too much downlink power then the base station or node b can run out of transmitter power and this is what was happening as you get more ues on the cell the noise floor rises and the cell has to compensate by ramping up its power to the ues
8645820 if the ue power control algorithm is faulty then they will demand more power from the cell than is necessary and with multiple users this can cause the cell transmitter to run out of power the net result is that some ues will drop their call i have seen the dropped call graphs that correspond to the iphone launch and when the 2 0 2 firmware was released the increase in dropped calls
8645821 the power control issue will also have an effect on the data throughput because the higher the data rate the more power the node b transmitter requires to transmit if the ues have poor power control and are taking more power than is necessary then it will sap the networks ability to deliver high speed data
8645822 this is one of the reasons why at amp t has been sending text messages to users to persuade them to upgrade to the 2 0 2 software in a mixed environment where users are running 2 0 2 0 1 and 2 0 2 the power control problems of 2 0 and 2 0 1 will affect the 2 0 2 users
8645823 i am so surprised to hear that question this honestly is the first time ive ever been asked that question im getting married and having children today
8645824 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone to all the media in the world
8645825 it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again and wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same
8645826 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8645827 his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful
8645828 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i was angry when i first read his attack on me but i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him

8645831 hello could i have the name and direct phone number of the food editor or religion editor assignment editor etc
8645832 yes the food editors name is mary smith her direct line is 543 1234 would you like me to connect you
8645833 yes my name is anisa abdullah i am a member of the toronto ramadan information committee our committee thought you might be interested in doing a story about the special foods muslims enjoy during the upcoming month of ramadan are you aware of what ramadan is
8645834 yes i know a little about the fast of ramadan and might be interested in doing something with it can you send me some information
8645835 yes i have fact sheets and background material dealing with ramadan i can also put you in touch with members of the community who could provide recipes for ramadan specialties from around the muslim world
8645836 thats great send me the material and ill see what i can do
8645837 i just need to register a domain but i dont want to host anything yet
8645838 sit back relax or take a vacation while i do the work for you
8645839 ratifying the compact could allow great lakes water to no longer be held within the public trust and instead be defined as a product for commercial use
8645840 i want to thoroughly understand the lasting impact this compact could have on great lakes water for years to come it took the governors more than three years to get this done so it is not unreasonable for congress to take the time necessary to make sure we are not opening the door for the commercialization of great lakes water
8645841 the water protection standards in the compact make several desperately needed reforms in water law including water conservation environmental protection and integration of ground and surface water management im confident that these standards will be enforced because the compact specifically provides for citizen enforcement
8645842 its the 11th hour for the great lakes compact but lets be sure its not the 11th hour for the great lakes before the u s house acts on the compact this fall congress needs to take steps to assure the document doesnt expose this magnificent ecosystem to commercial exploitation
8645843 establishes a precedent that water can be grabbed by profit hungry corporations who want to claim it is a product not subject to the compact this undermines the very purpose of the compact and creates a dangerous precedent for exporting water in the u s in this instance from the largest body of freshwater in north america
8645844 the privatization of water is a deeply troubling concern here and around the world
8645845 all you need to do is grab a bottle of wisconsin beer or any other of the fantastic brews we have in the great lakes region to know that waters been put into bottles for more than a century
8645846 at the end of the day if youre buying bottled water well youre probably paying at least 10 times what it costs to filter water from your own tap thats likely even healthier for you anyway some say thats naive or evian spelled backwards
8645847 been too focused on arguments related to how the water is used when the real argument to be made to the rest of the world is that our ecosystem cant survive if the water doesnt stay here
8645848 the compact is rooted in conservation that focus should be front and center
8645849 contains major loopholes that could result in the privatization of great lakes waters for commercial sale
8645850 the argument that the compact would be at risk because it would take too long to change it through further negotiations isnt applicable because if congress imposes conditions the states are basically bound to such conditions its either now or never
8645851 its just sort of this ever present need to be

8645854 theyve expelled from all villages remnants of the georgian population theyve destroyed their houses theyve looted their property theyve burned down their fields forests
8645855 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8645856 we understand the complicated history and reality of the south ossetia and abkhazia issue
8645857 in the meantime in light of our consistent principle and position on issues alike we hope to see relevant parties resolve the issue properly through dialogue and consultation
8645858 the situation in the region should be resolved in dialogue
8645859 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8645860 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8645861 given the evacuation of personnel and forecast track we have begun shut in procedures for a few shell operated assets that require long lead times such as subsea wells
8645862 these require special operational procedures and can take several days to shut in properly to ensure re start after the storm passes
8645863 were looking forward to spending two days in cozumel and playing two basketball games this weekend
8645864 were excited to see the team play together and this will help give us some extra preseason experience it will add to our team dynamic as well
8645865 e cos orchestrando esse potevano andare avanti invero le ore ot almeno finch lo spettacolo non principiava ecco ad agitar instrumenti et a cantare a squarcialaringe
8645866 pensavamo che magari sarebbe stato meglio trasferirci in india o tornare alla scuola per infermieri a lavorare con i disabili o a svolgere unattivit manuale non cera mai nessuno che seguisse questi impulsi nonostante si agitassero dentro di noi ogni giorno a volte ogni ora viceversa ci si incontrava nelle sale riunioni per discutere lordine del giorno
8645867 arlisa asked if she could do something with the rowing team to do a little team building and i asked some rowers if they would be interested in helping with that process
8645868 we got a bunch of rowers down there they taught them how to row took them out on the water and had some fun
8645869 for the players it was nice to do something a little different
8645870 it was something to get them out of their comfort zone where they still needed to communicate effectively work together and see what happens when just one person is a little bit off
8645871 we got a crash course in rowing especially once we got down to the boats but the crew team was very patient with us
8645872 we were in an eight person boat and it was interesting to see how that feeling of being together and working together to achieve a goal and putting little things together over the course of time is the only way to see success
8645873 it was pretty difficult at first to get everybody in sync people would miss the water on a stroke try to keep pace with the wrong person or every now and then catch a
8645874 not an awesome feeling but once we all started communicating and keeping rhythm with the coxswain we were able to really look like a team and move at a pretty good pace i felt a great feeling of accomplishment once we finally got it
8645875 we have to communicate and work as a team day in and day out its a part of our sport
8645876 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8645877 hes a former marine and great guy and hes older than i am so that might work
8645878 those are questions for the mccain campaign and i think they are going to make their announcement shortly
8645879 we now know that the higgs boson does not have a mass of 170gev c2 if it did have this mass then we should have seen evidence for it at the tevatron by now ruling out possible masses of the higgs is a very important part of the hunt for this elusive particle
8645880 the observation of the very rare zz process is a real stepping stone to the higgs following this with the first direct higgs mass exclusion since 2000 is tremendously exciting
8645881 it shows that the tevatron experiments are very much in the race for finding the higgs
8645882 perhaps i will learn to read before i go to college
8645883 pakistan went back on its ceasefire announcement 31 times since january this year and infiltration bids have been made from across the border 41 times in the same period
8645884 if pakistan and its isi agency do not stop all these what is the point of continuing with the cbm
8645885 they can take help of india in the task destroying terrorists training camps in pok
8645886 the nsg countries want india to give a guarantee that it would not conduct explosion in future besides iaea was demanding freedom to inspect the countrys civilian and strategic nuclear installations anytime
8645887 if india does not get a clean waiver in nsg it should backout from the deal immediately
8645888 the congress cannot befool voters by spreading falsehood on nuclear issue
8645889 the arguments by the pm and fm that low inflation rate and high growth rate cannot go together was untrue
8645890 the erstwhile nda government led by a b vajpayee despite adverse conditions like kargil war had achieved low inflation and high growth rate
8645891 on the one hand i give him credit for being true to his beliefs but certainly with concerns that there were even for his own party in illinois he would be to the left on some of those key votes
8645892 i try to view the challenges in my life not as annoyances but as confirmations of fortitude

8645903 xjtag is an absolute necessity for any company that is designing complex circuits that feature high pin count bga or chip scale devices xjtag is easy to use and incredibly fast which has enabled us to shave weeks off the development schedule for our rfeye module thereby leaving our development team free to develop rather than sitting around painstakingly debugging boards
8645904 xjtags appeal is also its versatility it is designed to be used right throughout the product lifecycle from design and development through to the factory floor and beyond
8645905 xjtag can also test both jtag and non jtag devices which means that test coverage is very high we can get to over 80 of devices on the rfeye boards via the jtag chain whats more xjtag provides the ability to re use and port test scripts between circuit boards which saves us loads of time
8645906 i am eating them one at a time not a handful
8645907 both the percentage and number of people without health insurance decreased in 2007
8645908 each year as program year closes i think i can never rouse energy and enthusiasm for another year and for the past 26 years as july closes i experience an inner stirring for the coming year initially i chuckled at my feeling now i have learned to embrace it and i am confident it is gods grace moving me toward the challenges and joys of the coming year
8645909 though i have never heard him articulate his dedication to serving as a catechist as a
8645910 it can be very intimidating to walk into a room for the first time as a catechist
8645911 most catechists are not school teachers and so the idea of teaching the catholic faith to others can seem overwhelming at first its actually better for catechists to think of themselves as coaches rather than teachers millions of adults dont hesitate to coach their kids sports teams well catechists are basically coaching young people into the catholic way of life
8645912 to be a catechist is not simply volunteerism its a vocation
8645913 its basically a recruitment video we need to get the word out that serving as a catechist is one of the most important tasks that we as lay people have
8645914 the word of god in the life and mission of the church
8645915 catechetical sunday is a time to celebrate the work of the catechist and renew our gratitude for these faithful men and women who persevere in the labor of passing on the faith
8645916 were kind of working amidst getting the building totally completed
8645917 its a celebration of native people and of shinnecock ancient history here on long island
8645918 we work very hard to make this a wonderful family oriented fun event
8645919 we consider our guests to be honored guests we want them to come get to know us have a good time and come back again

8645932 ritengo che le anticipazioni di giudizio che l antitrust ha lanciato con questi nuovi controlli siano veri e propri processi alle intenzioni e questo sottolinea ci ha profondamente colpito facendoci pensare a un intento persecutorio nei confronti delleditoria

8645952 this is a new platform for learning in the same way a laptop or a desktop was a new platform
8645953 the time is approaching when these little devices will be as much a part of education as a bookbag
8645954 are expecting a very high pickup of the iphone on their campuses
8645955 by the end the kids learn the balance of life
8645956 the educational segment is lagging behind the sophistication of the students
8645957 i applaud governor schwarzeneggers commitment to preserve proposition 1a and protect our local revenues in 2004 83 of california voters sent a message to our state legislature that local tax revenues remain with local government and be spent for local purposes
8645958 it is unfortunate that the legislature has become stone deaf and forgot who elected them to office as they look primed to raid our local funds once more to balance their budget
8645959 here in los angeles county with the protection of our local dollars we have been able to invest in our public safety departments hiring 50 additional prosecutors over 600 sheriff deputies 3 300 jail beds and 700 new positions in our probation department said antonovich
8645960 back then it was still a little bit of an exotic item
8645961 now they receive one as a high school graduation gift
8645962 when i first showed them the camera and how easy it was to put a video on youtube they looked like i had just pulled a rabbit out of my hat
8645963 a lot of students watched and we got a lot of feedback from people who were angry about the policy
8645964 a lot of kids told me later they used that video in discussions in other classes
8645965 this is a generation that has never known anything else
8645966 technology is so much a part of their conversation and their understanding and they expect people to understand what theyre talking about its as much a part of their lives as dinnertime
8645967 i had a student who said he thought e mail was really old school he mostly used facebook to communicate with his friends
8645968 students usually arrive not knowing how to use education oriented technology tools
8645969 but they quickly surpass their instructors in their ability to use them effectively
8645970 theres a lot of writing and preparation that goes into them
8645971 in fact a media assignment can be a powerful writing assignment it turns out the students do a lot more revision and rewriting on average than they would have done writing a conventional paper
8645972 renting out your vacation home allows you to have your cake and eat it too and the good news is its easy to do it yourself not to mention surprisingly lucrative
8645973 if you have a mortgage on your second home renting it out only 17 weeks will cover your mortgage payments for an entire year
8645974 if its paid for free and clear only five off week rentals will cover costs like bills for your phone power cable and association dues all the rest is profit when you consider that in some markets you can earn as much as 30 000 to 40 000 in rental revenue per year from your vacation home youre looking at a nice raise for yourself
8645975 life rarely turns out to look like we thought it was going to look
8645976 thats o k some of the happiest most successful people ive met during my years working in this field never dreamed they would rent out their vacation home and yet once they tried it they love doing it it pays to be flexible and keep your options open
8645977 traditionally many retirees would sell the home they lived in for 40 years downsize to a smaller house or apartment and split their time between that home and their vacation place in say florida
8645978 but there are drawbacks to doing that you lose your neighbors youre no longer close to your familiar grocery store and so forth and you dont get to pass the homestead down to your kids but by renting out your vacation home you can have the best of both worlds you can afford both places its the perfect balanced solution
8645979 when people decide to postpone retirement they may also postpone moving to their retirement home
8645980 even if they do retire and then rejoin the work force either full time or part time they may not want to live in the city they associate with retirement its a psychological thing and so in these cases its better to keep the vacation home a vacation home renting it out allows them to do that
8645981 heres another good reason for seniors to rent by owner they typically have time to handle the details
8645982 not that theres a huge amount of work involved but it is easier to respond to renter inquiries do bookkeeping orchestrate routine maintenance details when you arent tied down to small children and or a demanding career
8645983 who knows becoming a vacation rental property owner may become your encore career
8645984 buying and renting out vacation homes is addictive ive done this for years and i cant imagine ever not doing it its more than a way to make money its a richly rewarding way of life at any age

8646005 however people who are very ill are vulnerable to infections not all of which are avoidable
8646006 it is tragic that so many people are dying unnecessarily each year from clostridium difficile
8646007 the vast majority of these deaths could have been avoided if the government had only taken the right action at the right time
8646008 its appalling that the best labour have come up with to tackle this massive problem are gimmicks like gordon browns deep cleaning programme
8646009 we need better antibiotic prescribing and hygiene but also proper isolation facilities in hospitals to stop infections spreading
8646010 i want you to listen to me because im going to say something that will change your life forever you will never wear pleats again
8646011 everyone is working hard here and people are passionate about their feelings and this is the rough and tumble world of politics it wasnt the first time and probably wont be the last the main thing is this does not define us dont make more of this than it is
8646012 the situation at our channel is about to blow up
8646013 two other msnbc sources said some of the testy on air exchanges between keith olbermann and other network personalities were a public glimpse of much more intense behind the scenes turmoil
8646014 look when keith anchors he plays it straight down the line this is our team theyve served us well we love em and were going to be at the republican convention and its going to be great and i dont have any hesitation
8646015 my reaction to that is grow up they have to just grow up

8646018 jason is a massive muppets fan and is seen as the man to finally bring the muppet show back to tv
8646019 it will obviously have all its old fans but jasons comedy is hugely popular with youngsters so it will open it up to a whole new audience
8646020 if the movie script is popular jason will write the tv series too he is already coming up with ideas for it

8646029 but reading is a massive club when you see the lads that have come here and developed then it was just a good opportunity for me

8646040 lo m s rid culo es que ocurre a tres semanas de que venzan los mandatos de esos delegados y los representados elijan libremente
8646041 se habla de que la intenci n de ellos es clara y manifiesta y nos anticiparon que van a expulsar a los delegados van a hacer una reuni n de aparato con gente que ni siquiera es trabajadora es trucho e ileg timo lo van a hacer incluso a 50 kil metros de la capital es muy probable que los trabajadores quieran repudiar eso mediante la medida de fuerza

8646044 i dont think youll ever be totally happy with the squad that youve got
8646045 but if the right player comes along then hopefully well get him in
8646046 we felt we were a little thin on the ground particularly if we had injuries or suspensions
8646047 but russells a player both owen and myself know very well
8646048 he was a stalwart for aberdeen and was their first pick for 10 years so that shows how good he is
8646049 it seems that he just had a pen in his hand and they started fighting and at some point during the fight he began to stab the victim

8646096 im stunned and surprised its absolutely brilliant news i wasnt really aware i was in the frame and it is a surprise but obviously it is a very nice one
8646097 the chance of linking up with the squad for a game at wembley is certainly something to look forward to
8646098 i have not been involved with any of the england teams before i think i was close to turning out for the u19s but missed out with injury
8646099 its certainly a good progression for me which is what its all about as a professional its going to be a great experience
8646100 there are some top players in that squad just meeting up and training with them will benefit me its also good that kights is there as well
8646101 im not really thinking too much about whether ill get a chance or not

8646117 ive heard so many great things about tel aviv and israel but hearing is one thing and experiencing it for yourself is another we are planning to have a great time and a great evening
8646118 unfortunately the state of israel cancelled your performance in the country due to lack of budget and because several politicians in the knesset had believed at the time that your performance might corrupt the minds of the israeli youth
8646119 a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform
8646120 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8646121 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8646122 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8646123 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8646124 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8646125 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8646126 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8646127 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8646128 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8646129 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8646130 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8646131 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8646132 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8646133 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8646134 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8646135 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8646136 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8646137 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8646138 it seems that he just had a pen in his hand and they started fighting and at some point during the fight he began to stab the victim

8646140 a word of warning you are not going to see the same level of intensity every night for an 82 game season
8646141 one interesting thing to note in the interview is colangelos implicit frustration with chris bosh taking shots outside the paint and getting away from his low post game something he didnt do in the olympics hes also saying that this is the first time chris bosh was fully prepared for a tournament and that credit needs to be given to usa coaching staff note to sam mitchell this is an indirect shot at your preparatory skills which have proven to be far from adequate
8646142 five months before he was forced into premature retirement by balky knees in 2006 jonathan bender took the initiative to put together a relief effort that delivered two tractor trailers filled with donated goods to the victims of hurricane katrina in the new orleans area including his hometown of picayune miss he still hasnt stopped helping that initial act of kindness has blossomed into a full fledged entrepreneurial venture for the former pacers forward he owns an investment company that seeks community re investment opportunities a construction company that restores flood ravaged housing a property management company that leases those properties targeting displaced residents looking to return to the new orleans area and a realty company to help facilitate the sale of those properties to qualified families youve heard of a one man wrecking crew bender has become a one man rebuilding team
8646143 the most significant shift however might be seen in the play of lebron james last season in the nba james lined up at about 12 oclock on the diagram the style with which he most closely aligned was perimeter scorer in these olympics however james style reflects his commitment to doing whatever was needed by the team his minty green color and placement at a little before 11 oclock reflect his pure perimeter style though his relative proximity to the center of the diagram indicates that his fit here is not perfect rather than being the primary scorer for this team as he is accustomed to being in cleveland james stepped up the defensive intensity leading his team in blocks with eight and finishing second in the tournament in steals with 19 not to mention leading the tournament by a landslide in menacing scowls further he was second on the us team in assists 30 paul had 33 his assist to turnover ratio was a respectable 1 76 and he finished in the tournament top ten in total rebounds to put it in perspective the role james filled for this us team was similar to that played by magic johnson on the showtime lakers which is quite a niche indeed
8646144 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8646145 when theres so many discrimination cases coming out by ethnic minorities that speaks for itself
8646146 i think that there are even further allegations against sir ian at the moment which are probably just as serious i think its an accumulation of many allegations against him
8646147 my mom and aunt were just in town and enjoyed a great stay at the inn
8646148 lets slap some paint on it convert the diner to an asian themed bar and market it as a place for hipsters to crash

8646151 you dont do a bunch of blow and walk all crooked
8646152 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
8646153 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
8646154 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
8646155 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
8646156 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy people are suffering
8646157 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet
8646158 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8646159 once he does that forms a new government then he has put a final nail on this dialogue so what in fact you are doing is you are making people suffer and therefore declaring a war on the people
8646160 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator about the breaches that have occurred
8646161 i am not aware of that our hope is that all parties to the conflict in zimbabwe will abide by the agreement and finalise whatever outstanding issues that need to be finalised and signed
8646162 we still maintain that mediation is going on in zimbabwe
8646163 may be a strategy to arm twist the mdc to accept the deal that is on the table
8646164 the formation of a new government sends a message that talks my have collapsed
8646165 no because when i take them off i can see up close just fine
8646166 oh but you got a new brand so that changes things
8646167 they sacked her in order to cover up the truth but the truth will not be covered up forever one day it will be made manifest
8646168 ignoring subpoena is a contempt of court which carries prison terms but before such action can be taken the prosecution counsel must write to the tribunal demanding the arrest and punishment of such person committing the contempt

8646179 p laintiff contends that if veoh cannot prevent infringement on its site given the current volume of its business then veoh should be required to either hire more employees or to decrease its operations and limit its business to a manageable number of users whatever that number might be its not so subtle suggestion is that if veoh cannot prevent infringement from ever occurring then it should not be allowed to exist
8646180 veoh is distinct from napster in at least one significant respect napster existed solely to provide the site and facilities for copyright infringement and its control over its system was directly intertwined with its ability to control infringing activity in fact as virtually every interested college student knew and as the programs creator expressly admitted the sole purpose of the napster program was to provide a forum for easy copyright infringement
8646181 this court finds that no reasonable juror could conclude that a comprehensive review of every file uploaded to veoh would be feasible
8646182 t he record presented shows that veoh has taken down blatantly infringing content promptly responds to infringement notices terminates infringing content on its system and its users hard drives and prevents that same content from being uploaded again and terminates the accounts of repeat offenders once content has been identified as infringing veohs digital fingerprint technology also prevents the same infringing content from ever being uploaded again all of this indicates that veoh has taken steps to reduce not foster the incidence of copyright infringement on its website
8646183 t he decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less than scrupulous service providers may claim its protection

8646196 in the past i have achieved some success to have become european champion with the under 17 national team and of course at the age of 18 to have arrived to a big club as arsenal in london i have learned a lot it has been a life school and manager arsene wenger has helped me
8646197 today i can say i have reached a superior level by coming to this club i want to give 100 per cent and improve every day this team wants to return to the champions league and i will do everything i can to help

8646219 but given the strength and diversity of diageos business we believe we can deliver organic operating profit growth for the coming year within our range of 7 0 9 0 per cent mr walsh said
8646220 the main drivers of growth were international where scotch in latin america and beer in africa drove net sales growth of 16 per cent and north america where growth in the priority brands drove a 5 0 per cent increase in net sales mr walsh said
8646221 if it was going to have a major impact we would have seen it by now mr rose said
8646222 were not expecting a major downturn from here he said

8646227 recycling is one solution but its just a small part of the puzzle
8646228 vaginal birth has evolved markedly in the last 2 decades so that much greater emphasis is now given to the experience of the parents and to early bonding

8646232 we have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities for viper
8646233 as the company evaluates strategic options to maximize core operations and leverage its assets we have agreed to listen to these parties we will do so keeping in mind the best interests of those who have shown tremendous support for the vehicle including employees suppliers dealers and a worldwide group of loyal viper owners and enthusiasts viper is an integral part of this companys heritage while this is a strategic review our intent would be to offer strong operational and financial support during any potential transaction in order to ensure a future for the viper business and perpetuate the legacy of this great vehicle

8646235 my dad who fell on hard economic times always told me champ when you get knocked down get up
8646236 failure at some point in your life is inevitable but giving up is unforgivable
8646237 i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington
8646238 i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures our greatest presidents from abraham lincoln to franklin roosevelt to john kennedy they all challenged us to embrace change now its our responsibility to meet that challenge millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up back up together our debt to our parents and grandparents is too great our obligation to our children is too sacred
8646239 having worked with actors for many years i find it hard to believe that anyone would have to be dragged kicking and screaming into show business but the next time that you see a chimpanzee in a movie on tv or in an ad chances are thats exactly what happened
8646240 its a sad story that starts when the animals are babies when they are torn away from their mothers and forced to depend upon human trainers great ape mothers are fiercely protective of their newborns which means that they must be tricked sedated or forcibly restrained when their infants are pulled from their arms this cruel practice leaves lifelong emotional scars on both the mothers who go into a deep depression and the babies
8646241 this is an important milestone toward securing a future for the sumatran elephant and tiger
8646242 to ensure the commitment is effectively implemented we must redouble our efforts to eliminate poaching and illegal settlements within this special forest
8646243 tesso nilo is still under serious threat from illegal activities but if we can protect the forests there it will give some of sumatras most endangered wildlife the breathing room they need to survive
8646244 and while we greatly appreciate this precedent for more protection from the indonesian government there are other areas on sumatra that need safeguarding for the sake of its wildlife its threatened indigenous peoples and to reduce the climate impacts of clearing
8646245 i am thrilled to pave the way for california drivers to obtain insurance that is more environmentally friendly and more accurately reflects driving habits
8646246 as a strong advocate of healthy market competition and a healthy environment i am especially pleased to encourage this kind of innovation and additional options for consumers
8646247 california has always been at the forefront of technological innovation a major priority for the department of insurance is harnessing this technology to benefit consumers
8646248 at the same time it is vital that the privacy of drivers remains intact i will not approve any auto insurance policy that aims to utilize gps devices in order to obtain location data from consumers
8646249 i am really alarmed by the number of casualties caused by this air strike and other similar military operations
8646250 children are bearing the brunt of this conflict and also experiencing physical and psychological trauma
8646251 they must review their operational procedures to avoid such tragic events from reoccurring
8646252 it is important to put in place measures to prevent the excesses to have prompt investigations and where necessary to pay adequate compensation

8646256 mondays raid at howard industries in laurel mississippi is just the latest in a disturbing pattern of abusive raids on workplaces and homes that violate the due process protections guaranteed to all people living in the u s the government cannot simultaneously claim to be respecting the due process rights of the workers who were taken into custody while acknowledging that no lawyers were present when those same workers who will likely be facing criminal charges were interrogated this failure to provide access to a lawyer who can inform detainees of their legal rights comes in the wake of the postville iowa raid which made a mockery of due process by failing to ensure that detainees understood the charges against them assigning detainees an inadequate number of attorneys who were not given enough time to assemble a defense and then whisking detainees through a kangaroo court en masse for imprisonment and deportation we fear that immigrations and customs enforcement along with the department of justice and local law enforcement will use these same coercive tactics in the mississippi raid the bush administrations department of homeland security dhs policies have taken us down a dangerous path where well established due process and human rights have been abandoned for immigration policies that push expediency over justice we call upon senators obama and mccain to disavow policies that violate the human rights and civil liberties of people living in this country irrespective of immigration status everyone in detention must be treated with respect for their human rights and the rule of law
8646257 the fbi shouldnt have the unreviewable power to impose gag orders on the recipients of national security letters
8646258 as the district court ruled the fbis power to silence the recipients of these letters has to be subject to judicial oversight
8646259 this amendment violates not only the first amendments strong presumption in favor of free speech but also impermissibly limits the capacity of courts to behave as courts and to adjudicate fairly the propriety of any gag order
8646260 the delisting of the west virginia northern flying squirrel is part of the bush administrations plan to gut the endangered species act by keeping rare species off the list undercutting protections for some on the list and removing others from the list altogether
8646261 this is consistent with the bush administrations move last week to weaken regulations so that fish and wildlife scientists no longer advise federal agencies on the impacts of their projects on endangered species or consider the impacts of greenhouse emissions on endangered species
8646262 climate change is a serious threat to the west virginia northern flying squirrel and countless other species
8646263 the bush administrations head in the sand approach to climate change and endangered species is a recipe for extinction for the nations wildlife
8646264 the west virginia northern flying squirrel offers an example of a species proposed for delisting even though the recovery criteria have not been met
8646265 the administrations decision to remove protection for the west virginia flying squirrel flies in the face of the science on the species
8646266 clearly this is a political move to allow more destruction of the squirrels forest habitats by logging mining and development
8646267 these decrepit ships have been obsolete for decades and are now just floating vessels of hazardous waste with the water boards planned litigation the pressure is mounting on marad to stop breaking the law and start protecting san francisco bay
8646268 marads rotting ships are a massive source of pollutants to the fragile bay delta ecosystem we look forward to the water board joining our litigation to force marad to clean up its mess
8646269 the san francisco bay cannot remain a dumping ground for toxic waste some of these ships have been wasting in the bay for 50 years clearly this is an issue of deep concern to everyone who treasures our precious bay delta ecosystem and were pleased the water board joined the fight
8646270 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal mdg of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981
8646271 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8646272 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8646273 if you do ill act like i dont know you

8646286 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8646287 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
8646288 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones

8646297 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8646298 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8646299 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8646300 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8646301 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

8646359 it was a moment i thought would never happen in my lifetime
8646360 he was nominated not as a black man but as a man who is qualified to do the job and that made me proud
8646361 im proud of my country im 63 i was refused buying a candy bar when i was 7 years old i have been refused trying to purchase a home in an all white neighborhood this is nothing short of a miracle
8646362 i can hardly describe how i feel i am so excited
8646363 when i think about civil rights activist medgar evers who lost his life registering people to vote we have come a long way in this country and we need a man like barack obama to lead us into the future

8646605 we belong to groups like the chamber of commerce we will go there to get the word out that were looking for people those folks know a bit about our organization and are able to refer the types of people who might be a good fit
8646606 if you treat people like they are tools the first opportunity that comes where they can change their situation they leave not because theyre getting a better offer but because they want to feel respected
8646607 you have to create an environment at your company where people want to come and work for you
8646608 in our interviews i can say that no one pays better than us
8646609 each quarter we meet with all employees having our employees engaged in the organization and feeling that they are important to the success of the company is key for the retention of good people
8646610 this tends to be one of the biggest mistakes ive seen in my hr career it comes from lack of foresight and vision not because a manager has their head in the sand but because theyre so busy and buried in work theyre down three people and stressing so they get into panic mode post an ad and hire hire hire looking for people that pass the fog the mirror test

8646643 ayahmu dulu seperti orang umumnya tinggal bersama para saudaranya di sisi orang tuanya saudara ayahmu yang besar mengasihi ayahmu saudara yang kecil mendekat dan minta dinaungi bila kemudian allah memberi ayahmu ini nasib yang baik segala puji bagi nya dan aku pun rela menerimanya

8646650 find a resolution in the places where your interests intersect
8646651 i had been thinking about this project for a long time
8646652 as a camera fanatic and a product builder this was something i seemed destined to do
8646653 i have a bolex aaton arriflex eyemo filmo mitchell photosonic beaulieu keystone just about every movie camera you can think of
8646654 i told frederic that i couldnt even view my footage on a mac and that this had pissed me off enough that i wanted to build my own camera
8646655 we needed a bunch of guys who were inventors to come up with entirely new ways of getting to the finish line
8646656 but i heard about red because they were canvassing filmmakers and cinematographers asking if you could wave a magic wand what camera would you design
8646657 what separates us from other camera companies is that the vision guy is the decisionmaker
8646658 that was one of my biggest advantages at oakley and its the same at in the trenches in the product development and i make the final call red is a benevolent dictatorship
8646659 in hd whats right in front of the lens and whats 20 feet away are both sharp so the image looks flat
8646660 if it didnt work wed be cooked when it did it was like giving birth and counting all the fingers and toes to make sure everything was there it was phenomenal everybody went nuts
8646661 everyone started screaming like little kids first light first light its alive the thing actually worked
8646662 they were standing around scratching their heads that moment made a lot of people into believers
8646663 the red camera is the closest thing to film ive seen
8646664 jim why dont you fly down here to new zealand and ill shoot the footage for you
8646665 he was going to shoot a mini movie to put the cameras through their paces using them on helicopters and steadicams crawling on the ground with them and im thinking oh my gosh i just hope they keep working through the weekend
8646666 we stayed at peters house and he was just beaming because he was having so much fun
8646667 jim im all in i have to shoot with this
8646668 im making two movies with benicio del toro come to my house and well do a test if it looks as good as what i saw in peters film i want these cameras for my movies
8646669 it felt like someone crawled inside my head when they designed the red
8646670 a lot of cameras with electronics in them if you fired a 50 caliber automatic weapon a few inches away which we get microphonics all over the place
8646671 we beat the shit out of the reds on the che films and they never skipped a beat
8646672 you can buy this camera you can own it thats why people are excited
8646673 you put film in a can and stick it on a shelf and it costs 1 000 a year to store
8646674 with a project that starts as data you have it on a hard drive which has to be nursed and upgraded its an electronic mechanical device that cant be left unplugged
8646675 in the slammin jammin world of production you want a really tough machine that takes very simple approaches to problems
8646676 im not sure red is the way to go its a supercomputer with a lens on it
8646677 honestly if you proposed the film work flow today youd be taken to the city square and hung imagine i told you were going to shoot on superexpensive cameras using rolls of celluloid made in china that are a one time use product susceptible to scratches and that cant be exposed to light and you cant even be sure you got the image until theyre developed and you have to dip them in a special fluid that can ruin them if its mixed wrong people would think i was crazy
8646678 theres talent on the streets kids with ideas who have stories to tell and never get a chance
8646679 up to now theyve been limited to tools that confine their stories to youtube
8646680 i will say that the future of motion capture will be digital
8646681 and i think you can extend that to say the future of presentation will be digital
8646682 when someone puts a mike in our face and talks about what about the hillary supporter or the person who supported bill richardson or dennis kucinich we will say that we are democrats in a way that it will be so shocking to whoever asks the question that they will just stand back
8646683 they will just say let them walk on by there is some kind of glory walking by there is a light over them we are democrats we are one we are one nation we are empowered we are strenghtened we are democrats oh i am going do a dance up here
8646684 the past few years have been about show more than substance
8646685 these things became more evident as a result of her support for clinton
8646686 in the spirit and the idea of opportunity for women
8646687 as i have gone around in the district her message has been to elect the next president of the united states barack obama
8646688 i expect it is seeping in but i also hope that what they have garnered from me is the concept of integrity and loyalty
8646689 how did i get here from being a supporter of sen clinton
8646690 its because i am a democrat in this big tent because now more than ever having lived the life in the skin of someone oppressed by this administration led by this president i understand that i am seeking the light i am looking for the mountain top

8646698 its not just a question of sex but of timing often women are stimulated by sex and cant sleep afterward
8646699 if you can time things to coincide with the time of day when youre at peak energy your sex life will be significantly more satisfying
8646700 the average encounter is only around 20 minutes so ask yourself why youre hesitant your resistance might be a reflection of your lack of satisfaction with the sex
8646701 both of you not to mention the children you might have may pay the price of a fractured relationship later
8646702 if someone is your match in 75 to 85 percent of the things that are important to you values character strengths how he treats other people emotional not settling
8646703 but its up to you to infuse good enough with energy and passion so that it becomes fantastic and chemistry counts you need to be attracted to each other

8646725 we are working hard to iron out glitches before it goes out to users this is not about security issues
8646726 instead of delaying the launch of the database this intrusive project must be scrapped altogether
8646727 a recent independent review has already undermined all of the governments assurances that the database will be secure the discovery of further technical issues does not bode well for the future the government has proven itself untrustworthy with large databases containing sensitive data parents have every right to demand that their childrens personal details are not put at risk
8646728 the enormous size of the database and the huge number of probable users inevitably increase the risks of accidental or inadvertent breaches of security and of deliberate misuse of the data which would be likely to bring the whole scheme into disrepute
8646729 this looks like further evidence of the chaos at the heart of government we repeatedly warned the government of the problems with contactpoint but they pressed ahead regardless ignoring our calls to allow time to sort them out
8646730 there were clear indications in february of significant security concerns with this database only now with just weeks to go until the project is supposed to go live have they finally agreed to pull back to try to iron out some of the problems ministers now need to come clean and confirm whether this delay is because childrens personal information is at risk

8646745 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8646746 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work

8647243 if we dont do something we give the government an excuse to impose its own regulations and bylaws on these websites we definitely dont want that
8647244 but we still need to organize the work of these sites to avoid any future government intervention
8647245 we need assurances that the jpa is neutral and will not allow this code of honor to become a trap
8647246 i believe that if the government could have done something to limit the freedom of news websites it wouldnt have hesitated but it knows very well that these sites are not registered in jordan and their servers are not here
8647247 if they block my website they will prevent some 50 000 jordanians from accessing it and win me 200 000 readers from abroad while running the risk of being called backward and unprofessional the government is not stupid enough to do that
8647248 my attendance doesnt mean i approve of the move my position is clear khaberni will only sign the code of honor if all major news sites approved it
8647249 i have received numerous phone calls asking to remove the story but i wont do it
8647250 due to the intensity of comments and the fact that a lot of these comments crossed the line commenting has been disabled
8647251 we want to tackle the editorial policy of these websites so that they avoid profanity and personal attacks and attacks against the national unity
8647252 we need to maintain the credibility of these sites i advise every media outlet to commit to a form of self regulation this is not done because of fear of governments but to increase credibility in front of the public

8647258 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8647259 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8647260 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving

8647276 the strong message is if you mess with a u s military computer expect them to be ruthless in their pursuit of you
8647277 weve seen other hackers in the past compromise military pcs and receive significant jail sentences hackers need to wake up to the serious consequences of their illegal actions whether they are motivated by finding e t or stealing credit card numbers

8647290 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8647291 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession

8647295 contactless has become an essential technology for new and expanding campus card programs
8647296 we have more than 100 schools using or in the process of migrating to iclass
8647297 our smartcity system is a full campus card system providing many applications on a single contactless card
8647298 our college and university clients are requesting that we enable contactless technology in not only new installations but retrofit existing installs as well
8647299 interest in contactless technology has steadily increased amongst our client base with new inquiries coming in frequently a meaningful percentage of cbord customers have already implemented the technology
8647300 constantly gathering feedback from our clients on new technologies they would like us to offer many of the contactless solutions we offer currently were the result of university requests
8647301 blackboard is committed to delivering solutions to fit the needs of our clients
8647302 a simple and easy to handle application of the technology for the user
8647303 the user doesnt even have to take the smart card out of his wallet
8647304 driven by the advantages of convenience as well as performance
8647305 with less direct contact to a card there is an inherent longevity that may be enjoyed for the card itself
8647306 we made a conscious decision to use our current system after much research and even visiting campuses across the u s to see their particular systems
8647307 a new installation is of course a big investment but customers roi calculations prove that the investment is protected
8647308 activities of this scale require an investment of time and careful planning
8647309 phased approach which helps them from becoming overwhelmed by the tasks and enable them to support existing applications while upgrading one or two applications at a time

8647331 we were very pleased with the results of the test as both drivers were able to complete long runs on the specified tire combination with positive feedback on grip and performance
8647332 the right side tire has already seen action at both fontana auto club speedway with the cup and nationwide cars and kansas with the craftsman trucks earlier this year while the left side is a new code incorporating an updated construction that has a strong track record at the intermediate tracks this year

8647465 sometimes i would reach somewhere in the outback and i would think to myself surely no person could survive out here because it is so rugged so isolated yet these women have created amazing lives for themselves they have been really successful daring and resilient they were so diligent and worked so hard some have lost their husbands children and yet they still keep going on
8647466 part of the problem is that schools are under resourced to deal with it
8647467 its clear that teachers on the whole are being ineffective in their interventions
8647468 in school i remember a couple of people were in tears because of the bullying that was going on and nothing was ever done they didnt know who to talk to they didnt feel comfortable speaking to teachers
8647469 in therapy i try to get them to understand that the bullying theyre subjected to is a reflection of the insecurities of the bullies and nothing to do with them
8647470 the difficulty for kids developing an identity who arent sure about themselves is if you hear it the same taunts over and over again you internalise it you accept it as the truth and that becomes who you are
8647471 you have low self esteem and with that goes what we call mood disorders or depressive illnesses and of course anxiety disorders and that can last a lifetime

8647499 the right to request flexible working has worked well because it helps employees to balance their home and work lives but at the same time gives employers the right to say no where there are legitimate business concerns
8647500 parenting requirements dont end as children get older we think it is right to extend this successful scheme and help parents of older children access the flexibility they need
8647501 there will be businesses that will struggle and will find it difficult and there could well be businesses or organisations in the sme sector if you employ six staff and three of them come to you and say i want to request the right to work flexibly i can see how that could have a detrimental effect and a significant impact on the running of your business
8647502 on the evidence i have seen i do not believe that this extension will add significantly to business costs to put this in perspective it is clear from the existing practices of many large medium and small employers that they already operate open to all flexible working policies so in practice many employees will already have access to flexible working
8647503 equally many employees will not want to change their working arrangements as more employees are covered by the right to request i also expect that the number of requests which will be refused may rise as employers consider the overall impact on their business
8647504 ninety two per cent of women return to work after maternity leave with bt because they have a flexible working culture
8647505 out of their 115 000 staff 77 000 of them now work flexibly and 12 000 of that 77 000 are registered home workers so i think its down to the individual organisation
8647506 many employers offer flexible working to parents anyway and many of them offer it to all staff so for those that already having these type of working practices in place and already having the opportunity for staff to talk to their managers about changes to their working patterns i dont think its really going to impact on them that much its a right to request its a right to have the conversation about it rather than the right to have the exact pattern that you first asked for
8647507 some of the research finds people just want to start half an hour earlier and finish half an hour earlier
8647508 obviously some people want more radical changes but for the majority of people it wont be that big an impact on the business bottom line
8647509 being seen as an organisation or an employer that helps people to balance work with other aspects of their life is a good thing in terms of attracting and retaining people
8647510 you look at the way technology has evolved over the last five years with broadband and mobile technology and so on i think its becoming more and more apparent to the 29 million people who are employed currently in the uk that going to a place of work monday to friday 9 4 8 5 whatever it is this culture of presenteeism belongs to a bygone era
8647511 there are tremendous cost savings that can be achieved because for a start you dont need any buildings
8647512 probably in three to five years time flexible working will become the norm and i think people wont talk about flexible working or remote working or teleworking and all the terms that we give it right now i think theyll just say well this is how we work this is working

8647519 far too many men women and families fail to read the fine print on credit card offers and violate the terms and conditions as a result of the consumer to enact due diligence in researching the terms and conditions they pay far too much in interest charges and other fees
8647520 if credit card applicants would take an extra 2 or 3 minutes out of their busy lives they could save hundreds if not thousands of dollars on credit card fees fees such as interest rates and annual card costs could be reduced significantly if card applicants would simply apply for the card offer that is best for them

8647536 council observed that if the two jetties were to be closed down at the same time for repair work the refinery will invariably shut down and if it is shut down there will be scarcity of products in the south eastern states as well as some parts of the north to avoid such an unpalatable reality council recognised the urgent need of rehabilitating the two jetties

8647594 there were clear indications in february of significant security concerns with this database
8647595 only now with just weeks to go until the project is supposed to go live have they finally agreed to pull back to try to iron out some of the problems
8647596 instead of delaying the launch of the database this intrusive project must be scrapped altogether
8647597 a recent independent review has already undermined all of the governments assurances that the database will be secure the discovery of further technical issues does not bode well for the future

8647601 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

8647609 we are promoting absentee voting because the ballot is going to be at least three pages if not four
8647610 the sign restriction for mount vernon is 45 days before the election
8647611 we have not had for the most part any complaints about political yard signs
8647612 clearly this business of encouraging people to vote has made it more accessible and expanded the voting time
8647613 having been a candidate 15 times it seems reasonable to me if they are going to open up that window of time to vote then maybe mount vernon city council needs to look at that
8647614 personally i think if we are giving people more time to vote i think we need to go in and look at that sign restrictions again mavis said
8647615 i just think these are changing times and we need to relook at not just this but the entire sign usage ordinance
8647616 the voting process has been greatly lengthened in the last several presidential years
8647617 i guess i would ask the question why the limitations were put on the yard signs and is that relevant today i dont know what the reasoning was when the ordinance was passed does it need to be revisited yes it might i havent reviewed the ordinance myself and i probably should do that the party has been receiving signage by the candidates and has been passing it out the party itself has not been putting up the signs its ok for us to hand them out but its the property owners responsibility to put them up
8647618 i dont anticipate the democrats doing anything about the ordinance
8647619 and the reason is i dont think its a bad idea to have a restriction like that unless its unconstitutional as some people have suggested to me we will just have to live with the rule the partys just in line with what came down from city hall on this ordinance i dont think any of us have a problem with this
8647620 we bring out a sample ballot and the republicans do the same thing that is mailed out and the way we do it is when people register for an absentee ballot we get their names and we send them out usually just to democrats and sometimes to certain categories of undecideds that can have an effect
8647621 now the concern is that if somebody goes up to vote on sept
8647622 this would also have an effect on how you gear your media advertising
8647623 we have to keep those hours for the last day of voter registration
8647624 i had students who graciously gave up their seats just so some others would have a place to sit down
8647625 its about how many people in that room can be properly evacuated during an emergency situation
8647626 our job is just to make sure that the school realizes that capacity and they dont exceed it
8647627 i think its wonderful that the school system is taking a proactive role in ensuring the proper safety measures are in place
8647628 the economy ministry has already in cooperation with the privatisation fund produced

8647633 this is not going to be the year that we make big changes we know that we cant get major things done
8647634 to allow 11 percent of the party to dictate major decisions is a recipe for disaster no matter what the talking heads claim when rank and file social conservatives search their souls they will not pull the lever for a democrat who would be one of the most liberal presidents of our time
8647635 conversely the millions of social moderates women and independents are not single issue voters many of these voters are inclined to support senator mccain based on his experience as an independent leader but they reject the gops constant pandering to the extremes on social issues they are looking for a sign that senator mccain really believes in common sense and inclusiveness

8647643 kim deitchs career spans the entire post war history of avant garde comics from the underground to the literary mainstream
8647644 deitch brilliantly weaves vast intergenerational narratives that enfold a deep history of american popular entertainment distinctions between fiction and reality blur in his meta fictional world just as real madness bleeds into the visions and schemes of the artists entertainers and hustlers who populate his stories the result is a rich narrative tapestry as compelling and as breathtaking as deitchs densely layered tightly woven and intricately detailed black and white comics pages
8647645 what makes the difference between wishing and realizing our wishes lots of things and it may take months or years for wish to come true but its far more likely to happen when you care so much about a wish that youll do all you can to make it happen

8647658 the idea of the ropes is that they can be cut in an accident if a horse falls
8647659 it has been happening for the past year i had to replace them all three weeks ago and its a worry because the kids arent going to notice rope partially cut and could be hurt if it fell while they were using it

8647664 in december 2007 minister pallas promised full consultation with local communities and councils about b triples
8647665 john brumby should tell minister pallas to pick up the phone and start making calls instead of treating local communities and councils like mushrooms

8647670 after a successful inaugural cathie in guatemala this past april we are looking forward to working with the crowne plaza hotel amp convention center pronicaragua and the government of nicaragua as the hosts of this important and exciting investment forum for central america and indeed for the global hotel and tourism industry we were very impressed by the professionalism and the level of support at the highest levels in nicaragua from both the public and private sector in hosting cathie we believe this will translate into a stellar showcase event for the entire region
8647671 an important feature of cathie is the active involvement of the national investment promotion agencies in the region and the showcasing of new and exciting investment opportunities from each of the participating countries a significant level of deal making was reported at the first cathie which will contribute to the health and vitality of the tourism industry in the region we expect even more deals and more deal activity in 2009 as the region continues to grow and attract attention of the global investment community
8647672 we are extremely excited to host such a prestigious event we truly believe that this new edition will be a success demonstrating that central america as a whole has truly arrived as the next great destination for investment for us specifically it will be a great opportunity to demonstrate our country s enthusiasm towards attracting foreign investment and for participants an opportunity to confirm why many publications have called nicaragua the next tourism hot spot
8647673 the plan is about putting some structure and strategy around tourism across not only daylesford but the entire region
8647674 the success weve experienced in daylesford is undenied by anyone but it has grown organically on the back of some of the regions key operators
8647675 there will be one organisation like an umbrella and it will pull together the different elements of the local tourism infrastructure
8647676 we want to work in a supporting and positive manner with both state and federal governments

8647754 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8647755 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8647756 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8647757 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8647758 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8647868 there have been a lot of complaints about rec procedures from researchers in recent years they often find the process onerous and bureaucratic however this study is the first time anyone has systematically analysed what recs are saying about cancer trial proposals
8647869 recs are looking for evidence that researchers are sensitive to ethical issues in particular to participants interests and that information given to potential participants explains the trial fully and truthfully researchers can improve their chances of success at ethical review by really good preparation
8647870 two thirds of adverse events after a heart attack which may be a further heart attack stroke or major bleed happen after a patient has been discharged from hospital
8647871 our findings are of concern because we believe that the risk for patients whose heart attack was originally considered not as severe may be being misjudged
8647872 this does not mean to say that all patients who have had a heart attack will need surgical intervention but that doctors should carry out a simple recommended risk assessment that unfortunately is not being routinely used but which takes in a variety of factors to help work out the best treatment
8647873 we dont know how many people have this pms2 variant
8647874 we would like to take these findings to human tumor samples if we could find out which individuals carry this variant it might change our decisions about treating them with cisplatin

8647880 vaginal birth has evolved markedly in the last 2 decades so that much greater emphasis is now given to the experience of the parents and to early bonding
8647881 to emulate as closely as practicable the woman centered aspects of natural vaginal birth
8647882 and the baby then frequently delivers his her own arms in an expansive gesture
8647883 we now can say with reasonable certainty that we have a safe intervention that will reduce the chances that babies born very early will suffer cerebral palsy
8647884 its a drug that has a very high safety margin and its not expensive
8647885 if they find themselves in the unfortunate situation of facing an early pre term birth they should raise the issue
8647886 north american obstetricians use magnesium sulphate regularly and this would be an extension of that use rather than a new drug that practitioners arent familiar with and has a lot of side effects

8647889 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day the only time to meet friends is at weekends but for football players its the busiest time of all it was much easier for me to adapt to russia than england in england i had no one to talk to the first month was especially hard i lived alone in a hotel which i left only for training i thought i would go crazy inside those four walls
8647890 i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club i think i show that in the way i play every week i also have far too much respect for the people of manchester and england to criticize them in this way

8647893 i am writing to follow up on recent serious allegations regarding the creation of a false letter from tahir jalil habbush saddam husseins former chief of intelligence to saddam hussein
8647894 the letter which was allegedly backdated to july 1 2001 attempted to establish an operational link between al qaeda and saddam hussein in the period before the 9 11 attacks by specifically stating that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had received training in iraq
8647895 at the time of the alleged decision in 2003 to concoct the false letter the vice presidents office had been reportedly pressuring the cia to prove this connection as a justification to invade iraq
8647896 upon careful review of the allegations concerning this matter i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
8647897 the law specifically provides that no covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media

8648019 then you decide are you going to continue on or are you going to fold i felt as a songwriter that this was the best batch of songs that i had written
8648020 i really tapped into some of the local bands that were in edmonton in the late 80s dark room the sphere that i saw play when i was in my first high school band
8648021 those are the bands that got me excited about writing and performing music because they made it more tangible
8648022 to see david bowie do it and play commonwealth stadium that just seemed a world away to see an edmonton band get a record deal or get a song on the radio or play locally that seemed possible to me
8648023 the first records i ever bought as a kid were queen and kiss it blew my mind
8648024 fashion and music in my mind are very tightly wound im often so disappointed in the lack of visuals from a lot of bands we had a rule in this band from the beginning no street clothes on stage

8648038 heavy fighting broke out at 3 30am today between rebels and the army around the gorilla sector specifically near the patrol post of bukima and going down toward rumangabo park station the situation had been calm for some months but all this has just changed this is samantha i was at rumangabo this morning with diddy innocent balemba pierre and others and you could hear the mortars being fired not so far away and reverberating through the hills
8648039 when we left rumangabo heading toward goma we came across a convoy of military vehicles carrying all kinds of heavy weaponry and soldiers weapons are not my area of expertise but there was definitely a wide array on display of all shapes and sizes and also something called stalins organ a weapon with multiple tubes that looks like an organ and presumably fires a rocket from each hole

8648216 jai pass 2 semaines dans une clinique damaigrissement et jai
8648217 for almost 8 years and he still hasnt proposed hes told me im the one he wants to marry for the majority of the relationship lets say 5 years i didnt want to get married i was too young early 20s but now im older almost 30 and i want that commitment
8648218 in the beginning we both knew that we were going to be with each other for a long time
8648219 whats wrong with thinking youre too young to get married we both want the same thing thats why im wondering whats with the prolonging
8648220 you have taught your boyfriend for eight straight years your version of what love and committment is all about fear of committment
8648221 you have taught him how your version of love is suppose to work by the tone of your letter i am sure you can see much clearer now the reason for why you chose to stay with this person he is the you you so much wanted to become and now now that you have positioned him in that place where you had wanted to be where you feel comfortable changing in mid stream his mind will require a real life changing moment for the two of you
8648222 you are about to learn how breaking him of the lesson you have apparently expressed so well will undoubtedly be very tough
8648223 like i said when we meet people to love in a relationship we are meeting the people who best represent the best of what we see in ourselves
8648224 he is the you you had wanted to be with for these last eight years
8648225 i am not trying to be difficult i am trying to let you know how over the last few years you have taught him how comfortable your relationship has been in its present state from the very beginning as you said you knew the two of you would be together for a real long time i think that it is great you have apparently shared a very meaningful and seemingly even relationship for all this time right now i am sure you know it has not been even
8648226 your apparent choice to not get married young was a good thing most of us are pretty clueless about how love works in our early twenties however a whole new set of life realities exists as you draw closer to the big 3 0
8648227 a man sees those years as a time to make his mark because his forties are right around the corner so he views his marriage or relationships a tad different sometimes as an element of fear
8648228 women in my view are far and away a little more advanced in their understanding of their feelings then are men so the 30 thirties are a time when your passions for life arise you are actually going to become even more passionate about loving him should he still be around
8648229 all this passion in a woman at this time for a man can be a scary thing

8648232 current position does not do justice to our needs and demands and does not match the pattern set by the u s steel agreement
8648233 but it usually is a sign of impatience in bargaining
8648234 a strike vote is putting a bullet in the chamber
8648235 a sign that negotiations have really reached a stage where intensity in bargaining is necessary and you have to break from the past trend
8648236 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes this leads to overcharging on average of 24 percent for calls made and 19 percent for calls received
8648237 the regulation of billing increments within the eurotariff or any other roaming tariff would amount to micro management and would risk further erosion of competitive differentiation in the market

8648303 the bottom line is i dont condone the lifestyle and what they were asking me to do in my official capacity as mayor was to issue a proclamation which in essence endorsed the gay lifestyle

8648316 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8648317 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8648318 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8648319 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8648320 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8648321 her first awareness of him is a presence unseen a stench it comes around the corner before him preceeding his physical entrance in a sickening downdraft that washes over her and she recoils from the smell which is a combination of rank body odor and sewage and sulfurous stink of rotten food and it assails her nostrils with the foulness of evil then seeing him she flinches again fighting to regain her composure resolutely politely trained to serve the public a smile fixing itself to her mouth as he approaches the counter in his awful stinking swirl of poisonous air
8648322 he thinks how easily he could have killed the aloof woman behind the counter how pleasant it would have been to sink a sharp object into her throat ripping down across the breasts and then the abdomen and then gutting her and taking the parts he liked best and the thought of this fills his head with a scarlet roar
8648323 in truth the only difference between those who have failed and those who have succeeded lies in the difference of their habits good habits are the key to all success bad habits are the unlocked door to failure thus the first law i will obey which precedeth all others is i will form good habits and become their slave

8648342 sen mccain would keep us on offense with terrorism and senator obama would put us back on defense
8648343 with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8648344 i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the future conduct of the roll call vote
8648345 all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and i move sen barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclimation as the nominee of the democratic party as the president of the united states

8648349 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8648350 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8648351 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8648352 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea which is change in america doesnt start from the top down
8648353 it starts from the bottom up that change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things and so we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8648354 take calculated risks that is quite different from being rash
8648355 i want to emphasize the importance of focusing on the enemy when planning and conducting combat operations first you must know your enemy second you must develop your plan keeping the enemy foremost in mind third you must wargame your plan to enhance your ability to develop or adjust the plan once enemy contact is made

8648394 at saddleback he obama assured a reporter that hed have voted yes on that bill if it had contained language similar to the federal version of the born alive infants protection act
8648395 even though the language of both the state and federal bills was identical senator obama said people were quote lying about his record
8648396 when that record was later produced he dropped the subject but didnt withdraw the slander and now even senator obamas campaign has conceded that his claims and accusations were false

8648401 strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

8648449 we are working hard to iron out glitches before it goes out to users this is not about security issues
8648450 instead of delaying the launch of the database this intrusive project must be scrapped altogether
8648451 a recent independent review has already undermined all of the governments assurances that the database will be secure the discovery of further technical issues does not bode well for the future the government has proven itself untrustworthy with large databases containing sensitive data parents have every right to demand that their childrens personal details are not put at risk
8648452 the enormous size of the database and the huge number of probable users inevitably increase the risks of accidental or inadvertent breaches of security and of deliberate misuse of the data which would be likely to bring the whole scheme into disrepute
8648453 this looks like further evidence of the chaos at the heart of government we repeatedly warned the government of the problems with contactpoint but they pressed ahead regardless ignoring our calls to allow time to sort them out
8648454 there were clear indications in february of significant security concerns with this database only now with just weeks to go until the project is supposed to go live have they finally agreed to pull back to try to iron out some of the problems ministers now need to come clean and confirm whether this delay is because childrens personal information is at risk

8648590 los padres son un factor importante pero tambi n hay cuestiones de raza clase socioecon mica educaci n la universidad a la que uno va incluso el lugar donde uno vive

8648601 hi i read your blog everyday and im asking you to consider also affiliating yourself with independent bookstores across the country not only would doing so benefit me and my fellow indie booksellers but it will also benefit communities across the country as you may be aware independent businesses are important for communities in the following ways x y and z and furthermore indie bookstores in particular are good for this that and the other thing so wont you please consider
8648602 and will they please stop talking down to us like were luddite idiots this means you jennifer nix and you margo baldwin
8648603 i hate to tell you indie booksellers but this isnt just about business
8648604 hey everybody we believe in sustainability but we think that amazon is the best way to release important books not those pesky indie stores with all their individual buyers and branches indie stores are good for some things but its definitely not getting the word out to liberal minded book buyers in a timely fashion

8648619 it is not easy when you have the pre season we have had when sometimes you are missing 10 players for a variety of reasons internationals or the olympics

8648625 we are working to try to improve the squad it is not easy to bring in too many players at this stage with the window coming to an end maybe just the one will be all we can manage
8648626 we have been working and trying to improve the squad without thinking of the money from the champions league
8648627 we can progress if we have options but now with this money maybe it will be easier
8648628 for us it is important to be playing for trophies but of course the money is important but if you can win games like this it gives you the opportunity for more money we understand that
8648629 it was a very tough game and you have to give them credit
8648630 they have made it difficult for us over two legs but we have managed to scrape through when times are hard it is about sticking together showing character and trying to grind wins out and that is what we are managing to do
8648631 the most important thing is that we are through we did not give our best performance but kept working really hard until the end and i am really happy with another goal in europe
8648632 we wanted to play in the champions league because we know how good it can be we have been in a final and a semi final over recent years and we want more

8648697 when i was 15 i went to a vocational school and i wanted to get into the plumbing program funny enough i couldnt get into it there were too many people that had applied for it so as a second choice i chose culinary arts the third choice was pause i probably shouldnt say this pause but the third choice was hair dressing so it was a good thing that i got in laughs i am not a big fan of physical labor laughs so anyway i think that would have killed my father
8648698 darden restaurants inc warned investors that its quarterly profit will come in well below wall street estimates and cut its forecast for the full year on tuesday sending its shares down 15 percent
8648699 people were not in the restaurants in the volume we were anticipating
8648700 for a large part of that period gas prices were extraordinarily high
8648701 it was a challenging consumer environment and its possible that consumers at the tail end of the quarter were watching phelps instead of going out
8648702 stock markets go up a third of the time down a third of the time and sideways a third of the time
8648703 note that bear market cycles begin on reduced volume as the major downward phase develops volume increases and this phase ends in a selling climax on heavy volume the ensuing rally is accompanied by declining volume which dwindles until the rally loses momentum completely and the major trend is resumed in a new bear cycle bear market rallies start out of active climaxes
8648704 bear markets seem to be divided into three phases the first being the abandonment of hopes upon which the uprush of the preceding bull market was predicated the second being the reflection of the decreased earning power and reduction of dividends and the third representing distress liquidation of securities which must be sold to meet living expenses each of these phases seems to be divided by a secondary reaction which is often erroneously assumed to be the beginning of a bull market

8648722 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective or deliver that pregnancy
8648723 the evidence regarding the relative associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
8648724 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
8648725 global statements about the psychological impact of abortion can be misleading

8648741 you cant do this i am a united states congressman
8648742 i just wish the council could have had a say over all of this because we know more than the government does exactly what these post offices mean to people
8648743 i think its a terrible shame and the elderly in particular are being treated appallingly by all of this they have really gone to town on wolverhampton because to face five post offices closing in one go is a big blow
8648744 a lot of people need the post office and it provides a lifeline for them the government wants us to use local shops more and avoid taking the car but how this will help i dont know
8648745 when a post office closes people start using the nearby shops less too it is a service that some people desperately need and this city will be poorer without them
8648746 the council has had no say whatsoever in all of this we are the local authority and know exactly how bad this will be it is awful for everyone
8648747 these closures would be a hammer blow to community life here in stourbridge and so the government should think again
8648748 there is massive opposition in stourbridge to these proposals if the government is serious about listening to people as part of their consultation it will be impossible to close our post offices
8648749 this level of growth is demonstrating the resilience of our economy even in the face of high energy prices and the housing market downturn
8648750 he has just been admitted for abdominal discomfort investigation will commence tomorrow morning and there is no cause for concern
8648751 the health inequities we see in the world are absolutely dramatic in their scale
8648752 between countries we have life expectancy differences of more than 40 years a woman in botswana can expect to live 43 years in japan 86 years
8648753 one of the recommendations in the commissions report is that there should be universal health care systems that are available to people regardless of ability to pay
8648754 virtually all advanced countries have universal health care systems but we dont think that should be limited to high income countries we think that could be much more broadly available
8648755 we are distressed by the reports we see of health care simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay we see that throughout low and middle income countries
8648756 its not perhaps the best use of the money that is being spent and there are a lot people who feel that and would actually like to see coming out of the current campaign in the u s proposals for a universal health insurance
8648757 the importance of prevention continues to grow partly because of escalating health care costs we simply cannot afford the way we go about doing health care nowadays without tackling and doing more prevention
8648758 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8648759 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8648760 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8648761 after all these years it has been worth it i have the daughter i always wanted my family begged me to stop trying but when you want something that much you cant stop
8648762 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8648763 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8648764 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8648765 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8648766 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8648767 my gawd what the hell do you eat that tasted horrible ive never tasted anything like it

8648772 together we prevailed in a hard campaign in which republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8648773 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country and when he says to continue to spend 10 billion a month when the iraqis have a surplus of nearly 80 billion thats not change thats more of the same
8648774 we deeply regret this incident and apologize for the concern and inconvenience it has caused we are committed to helping those who were affected and strongly encourage them to sign up for the complimentary credit monitoring and to take the action steps outlined in our letter

8648779 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8648780 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8648781 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8648782 manchester city can exclusively reveal that shaun wright phillips has rejoined the club
8648783 the fans favourite agreed personal terms after completing a medical this morning thursday and joins on a four year contract following an undisclosed deal being reached with chelsea
8648784 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8648785 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city
8648786 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club
8648787 that germany is still in better shape than most other eurozone economies
8648788 the clock for the german labour market is literally ticking it is only a matter of time before the economic slowdown will be felt
8648789 we expect clearer traces of the economic slowdown to become visible later this year
8648790 was in line with the trend established over the past two years
8648791 to fall modestly further during the latter months of 2008 and possibly even in early 2009 despite the dampening influence from the slowdown in economic growth
8648792 there has been no excessive hiring in the current cycle
8648793 the labour market has become more flexible mostly through deregulation of temporary employment

8648801 while we have shown that the new probe can work for two types of procedures we believe that results will be more far reaching
8648802 there are many catheter based interventional procedures where 3 d ultrasound guidance could be used including heart valve replacements and placement of coils in the brain to prevent stroke wherever a catheter can go the probe can go
8648803 while the images obtained this way are good some patients experience adverse reactions to the contrast agent
8648804 also the images gained this way are fleeting the 3 d ultrasound guidance does not use x ray radiation or contrast agents and the images are real time and continuous
8648805 these tiny transducers work together to create one large transducer working much like the compound eyes of insects
8648806 i believe we have shown that 3 d ultrasound clearly works in a wide variety of interventional procedures
8648807 we envision a time in the not too distant future when this technology becomes standard equipment in various catheter kits

8648810 those are questions for the mccain campaign and i think they are going to make their announcement shortly
8648811 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8648812 john mccain if you love george w bush so much why dont you marry him oh thats right you dont believe in gay marriage
8648813 sen mccain if you think bush is so great why are you ashamed at how much you want to be like him if bush is so great then you have nothing to hide

8648834 it was not obscene and it was never anything sexual or lewd it was about the excessive packaging issue
8648835 they were cautioned that dependant on the conduct during this event that should they violate the law they were subject to arrest
8648836 it didnt violate their lease and that certainly was what we were concerned with
8648837 our mall manager sat across from our shop to make sure that nobody was harassing us but we had no issues
8648838 we did have people come in and ask us why we were naked and they were intrigued by the idea of naked products but no one was offended
8648839 theres a certain amount of cargo thats locally destined that really doesnt make sense to ship out anywhere else
8648840 more like a relief valve for us than a direct competitor
8648841 and that essentially adding an additional doctor who then has to be called in an emergency situation to come in and make these assessments is really designed simply to burden the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion

8648845 este o suma pe care trebuie sa o suporte fiecare candidat pentru campania centrala a partidului este o chestiune normala mi se pare corecta si este bine ca este la vedere pentru ca partidul la sediul central trebuie sa aiba un fond de campanie la care trebuie sa contribuie toti candidatii
8648846 candida ii care nu vor plati pina la 1 septembrie contravaloarea a 2 500 de euro la sediul central al pnl conform adr sg nr 61 vor fi scosi de pe list

8648856 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes this leads to overcharging on average of 24 percent for calls made and 19 percent for calls received
8648857 the regulation of billing increments within the eurotariff or any other roaming tariff would amount to micro management and would risk further erosion of competitive differentiation in the market
8648858 billing increments are a point of differentiation that operators can use to appeal to customers with different preferences

8649121 we have been working with the mentor initiative for years on important malaria control initiatives
8649122 when it comes to disaster relief they have the skills and network to get our malaria control products to people in need and make sure that recipients understand how to use them when we understood that the situation in myanmar was about to get worse we immediately decided to make a contribution that would benefit affected communities
8649123 malaria is the leading cause of mortality in myanmar the transmission of malaria will soon predominate across the flooded areas of the ayeyarwady delta and yangon district and if not effectively controlled it will cause large scale suffering and death
8649124 no adequate malaria vector control or means of effective case management is in place in the worst affected flood sites and for many interceptor could be the single source of protection

8649143 prescheduled meeting aimed at discussing security matters at strategic level the discussion was held in an open and cordial manner
8649144 actually ive fallen several times like four times already but this one time i fell it was the only one that made perez hilton and youtube i didnt think anything of it when it happened i just laughed it off onstage but the next day i see that it hit the internet and i was like nooooooo it totally stung because i wasnt expecting it but i didnt get hurt and joe jonas helped me out a lot with that he made a ton of jokes about it
8649145 i did a duet with the jonas brothers on my album and we wrote the song together
8649146 its like a breakup song and its called on the line it was important to have them on my album because i mean just look at how successful they are i would love to have their input anytime because theyre obviously doing something right
8649147 i tend to write songs that are i guess a little bit more intense and less catchy and i needed help writing catchy songs
8649148 so thats where they came in i put a lot of my musical input and lyrics into these songs and they just helped me with hooks and stuff like that
8649149 theres a song i wrote myself that i hope fans will react to and connect with
8649150 the song is about feeling insecure and just not feeling pretty and i hope girls my age can relate to it because i just felt like there needed to be a song about how not everyone has confidence i know it sounds cheesy but its true
8649151 i used to write really dark songs every night in my room like five or six a night and id be up until 5 in the morning and my mom would come up and say so what are you writing
8649152 id play her a song and shed go wow go to therapy but it really is therapy for me so i put everything in my lyrics you wont necessarily find a lot of that on the album but hopefully you will on the next album its my first one so i wanted it to be fun stuff you can drive around in your car to and jam out to
8649153 shes done collaborations with reba mcintire who was her idol growing up and kelly clarkson has been my idol growing up hopefully one day i could collaborate with her that would be the biggest dream come true
8649154 i was asleep the other day and i woke up to a text message saying big joe what up
8649155 i was like oh somebody is playing on my phone again i hit him back with a bunch of question marks and he hit me back with this is game still i wasnt convinced yet then i started checking my messages and apparently he was on a new york radio morning show and asking if anybody had my phone number and said he was trying to reach out to me so i eventually called him we had a great conversation talked about a lot of things he invited me to come to his show come kick it i took him up on it
8649156 it was more so a joe budden vs g unit thing which at the time game happened to be a part of so i mean it wasnt anything personal between myself and him and it was so many years ago and i think we both grown and gotten past all of that verbal bashing i thought tuesday nights show was great for hip hop
8649157 the picture was more so to say well dead the beef but we dont necessarily need to care for one another the situation last night was totally different he showed me a whole lot of love him and his people it was altogether a great experience i was standing there during the show like a fan dude brought out dana dane kool herc maino who is like family to me rae and ghost i think all these people who i am all cool with were shocked to see me but the energy in the building was great

8649190 it was the dedication to excellence by both the equipment sponsors and the team that made it happen most of all we appreciate the confidence bjarne riis had in us back in 2002 and thank him for these past six years the financial realities of pro cycling today have caused a change in priorities for the team and we respect that our main reason to work with a team is to develop new products and how better to accomplish that than by owning the team
8649191 cerv lo testteam will race as a professional cycling team with a continental pro standing

8649193 cerv lo testteam will be managed by cycling united racing out of switzerland together with the professional womens team currently known as team cerv lo lifeforce
8649194 as a partner of the womens team we have seen their very high level of professionalism and their impressive results
8649195 so it was a natural decision to use the current platform and reinforce it with additional staff
8649196 its a natural fit two organizations with a long term commitment to competitive cycling combine rabobanks talent with giants ability to create superior products and great things are sure to happen
8649197 i am very happy with how the team rode today my form is not good since im just getting back from beijing it just shows how important it is to have a strong team behind you
8649198 the team wasnt invited the vuelta and its a spanish team that indicates to us that they wont be riding in any of the three grand tours next year our sponsorship depends on working with a professional team that will be riding our bikes through the full uci aso schedule
8649199 we will sign as many riders and personnel from gerolsteiner as possible

8649271 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8649272 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics

8649279 i would have to save the book of revelation because if our society ever does ban literature and or the bible thats the time when we will need to
8649280 i think that everything you said was great blake scharzenbach is a poet and his words helped me through my crazy early teen years in fact i have never stopped
8649281 we are ever confident that it will get done but we have always said it will go to the wire
8649282 we will keep moving it on and we hope that he will be joining us here at
8649283 there were two players luiz felipe scolari identified one was deco and one was robinho and we have already seen the impact deco has made on the premier league
8649284 i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without robinho but with him it is an added dimension
8649285 robinho continues being a real madrid player and the coach counts on him
8649286 those in charge of the sporting side of things want him to continue and ive always wanted to follow the plans of those who really know about these things
8649287 me going to chelsea im staying as a rossoneri player
8649288 i should help milan to win the trophies were up for this season
8649289 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay here until now its always been that way
8649290 my goal is to win milans is too as long as we are like that ill remain at milan
8649291 he wright phillips doesnt want to join either of them and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8649292 the first half was without doubt the best we took all our chances scored five goals and we were passing the ball well our rivals also helped us a lot because they thought the game started at 11 oclock
8649293 it is one more trophy for us and it is a good way to start off the season this sunday
8649294 i have nothing to say i am not thinking about the champions league because it is not necessary to
8649295 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8649296 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8649297 we will get better little by little by the time the group games come around we will be ready
8649298 it is not easy when you have the pre season we have had when sometimes you are missing 10 players for a variety of reasons internationals or the olympics
8649299 then you have two or three players returning one week then the next week there are more
8649300 now we have the players back and the confidence that we need to be successful this season
8649301 we will continue to improve we will be completely ready as a team when the group stages start
8649302 up until now we have been preparing for every game missing four or five players each time
8649303 now after a few players have returned we will improve with each match little by little we will improve to be ready for the big matches that will come
8649304 we are working to try to improve the squad it is not easy to bring in too many players at this stage with the window coming to an end maybe just the one will be all we can manage
8649305 we have been working and trying to improve the squad without thinking of the money from the champions league
8649306 we can progress if we have options but now with this money maybe it will be easier
8649307 for us it is important to be playing for trophies but of course the money is important but if you can win games like this it gives you the opportunity for more money we understand that
8649308 it was a very tough game and you have to give them credit
8649309 they have made it difficult for us over two legs but we have managed to scrape through when times are hard it is about sticking together showing character and trying to grind wins out and that is what we are managing to do
8649310 the most important thing is that we are through we did not give our best performance but kept working really hard until the end and i am really happy with another goal in europe
8649311 we wanted to play in the champions league because we know how good it can be we have been in a final and a semi final over recent years and we want more
8649312 first we had to win the qualifier and it was a tough game we believed in ourselves and even though it was not our best performance we always know we have the quality to score
8649313 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8649314 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8649315 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8649316 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8649317 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8649318 no doubt about it hes just good no matter what he talks about
8649319 great deal on her own past which was a little annoying

8649329 los hechos de mayo 1937 fueron una explosi n espont nea de la clase obrera frente a la minimizaci n y el debilitamiento de la revoluci n de las conquistas revolucionarias esto se aven a con la pol tica de la urss que no quer a el triunfo de la revoluci n andreu capdevilla presidente del consell deconom a de catalunya me dijo en una ocasi n ya en el exilio que los partidos burgeses y el psuc quer an deshacer las colectivizaciones incluso quince d as antes de entrar en barcelona los nacionales ni la urss ni su internacional comunista han podido nunca admitir la existencia en ning n lugar del mundo de partidos comunistas no oficiales es decir que no dependieses o que no estuvieses adscritos a la iii internacional pero nuestro caso lexist ncia del poum el de catalu a era para direcci n de la iii internacional un problema porque siempre desde la creaci n del partit comunista catal hab a sido m s fuerte e influyente en todos los aspectos de la vida p blica sindical pol tica etc tera que el partido oficial dependiente de mosc no pod an admitir que hubiera un partido comunista m s fuerte que el oficial y menos a n cuando en este pa s se hab a declarado una revoluci n tras los primeros tiempos de desorientaci n al comienzo de la guerra el pce decide apoyar la creaci n de una rep blica parlamentaria de nuevo tipo y esta ser su consigna durante toda la contienda para ellos la guerra era un problema de antifascismo no de revoluci n su actitud era contrarrevolucionaria por eso iban contra las colectivizaciones y todo lo que significara un apoyo a la revoluci eran objetivamente unos aliados de franco porque tambi n este iba contra la revoluci n social y el derecho de las nacionalidades ib ricas a su independencia
8649330 en efecto en su discurso del 9 de mayo en el cine capitol de valencia despu s de acusar a los trotskistas de contrarevolucionarios y agentes del fascismo se dedic a resumir el proceso realizado en mosc utilizando incluso t rminos manejados por stalin o manulilski todos los obreros afirma d az deben conocer el proceso que se ha desarrollado en la urss contra los trotskistas es trotski en persona el que ha dirigido a esta banda de forajidos descarrilando los trenes en la urss practicando el sabotaje en las grandes f bricas haciendo todo lo posible por descubrir los secretos militares para entregarlos a hitler y a los imperialistas del jap n y cuando esto ha sido descubierto en el proceso y los trotsquistas han declarado que lo hac an en combinaci n con hitler con los imperialistas del jap n bajo la direcci n de trotski yo pregunto es que no est totalmente claro que eso no es una organizaci n pol tica o social con una determinada tendencia como los anarquistas los socialistas o los republicanos sino que el trotskismo debe barrerse de todos los pa ses civilizados si es que de verdad quiere liquidarse a esos bichos que incrustados en el movimento obrero hacen tanto da o a los propios obreros que dicen defender ante la elocuencia de las palabras de jos d az s lo merece destacar que los ataques del pce al poum fueron increscendo mundo obrero rgano central del pce combati constantemente al poum y exigi su disoluci n las acusaciones de trotskistas fascistas de nidos de fascistas a sueldo de los centros de espionaje alemanes o de verdaderas guerrillas de nuestra retaguardia son constantes mundo obrero incluso ataca a rganos de premsa y dirigentes de la cnt que defienden al poum como castilla libre o juan l pez

8649336 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8649337 i think im more in touch with the american people as far as my policies my proposals and my ideas
8649338 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8649339 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8649340 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8649341 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8649342 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8649343 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader

8649357 we used to play basketball together i even played football with his team
8649358 when he was a freshman i said this young mans got a chance to be the best weve ever had here
8649359 hes not a kid whos just out there hes the hardest working kid on the field
8649360 everybody had a lot of respect for his ability because they had seen him play little league football
8649361 he already had a reputation as a really good player so all the kids respect the heck out of what hes done on the field

8649369 he said undoubtedly that illinois would be the school for him and he thought it would be a good option for me
8649370 if i had the opportunity to play blaine that would just be awesome from a friend standpoint
8649371 just that rivalry weve always had it would just get bigger and better

8649398 nueva constituci n por s misma no es milagrosa requiere compromiso de todos
8649399 sinceramente preferir a que el debate fuera mucho m s frontal y que podamos debatir sobre exactamente cu l es la visi n que quienes empujan el no tienen del pa s de la econom a del papel del estado de los derechos de las personas porque es muy dif cil debatir con pretextos
8649400 el agua es un bien p blico y siempre lo ha sido no es un bien privado y no es un bien susceptible para la apropiaci n privada hay sectores que han comprado los m rgenes de los r os y los terrenos que poseen fuentes de agua y a partir de ah un recurso que probablemente ser uno de los m s importantes para el pa s y para el planeta en los pr ximos a os
8649401 la nueva constituci n tiene una transitoria que ordena que despu s del s se borre el padr n electoral el padr n de partidos pol ticos y quien quiera participar pol ticamente tendr tendremos que organizarnos y volver a inscribir militantes partidos directivas y organizarse con principios democr ticos y yo creo que eso provocar a el derrumbe de muchos partidos que ahora s lo son coraza y que en realidad hace tiempo han perdido el apoyo de lo que alg n d a fue su militancia
8649402 si no me equivoco en la d cima octava que dice que las universidades que ven an siendo financiadas por el estado y que eran particulares seguir n siendo financiadas siempre y cuando se sometan a una evaluaci n y que destinen ese financiamiento a cubrir becas de escasos recursos si las universidades han manejado bien los aportes que reciben del estado no deber a de ser un problema para esas universidades
8649403 estamos hablando de un estado que no solamente es un tercero imparcial digamos como para el liberalismo pol tico m s estricto el estado es un tercero imparcial que no interviene para resolver conflictos
8649404 es mentira y creo que lo verificamos que el mercado es como una mano invisible que todo lo controla y se ajusta a cualquier desperfecto eso no es cierto el estado tiene que hacer una regulaci n de actividades tan delicadas como por ejemplo de la actividad financiera y el sistema financiero
8649405 con el mismo o con mucha mayor rigidez de lo que se plantea la nueva constituci n
8649406 otra transitoria ordena que el sistema financiero no puede tener medios de comunicaci n y hay una disposici n que indica que esos medios de comunicaci n sean vendidos no significa que se le est quitando que se le va a confiscar y dice que tiene dos a os para venderlos y que recuperen su dinero pero hay negocios cuya propiedad en tri ngulo ha sido perversa cada banco ten a su propia agrupaci n medio de comunicaci n o partido pol tico
8649407 hay cosas que el estado no puede hacer para pasarse por encima de mil derechos y mil libertades tambi n hay cosas que el estado debe hacer como cosas prioritarias para garantizar cierto nivel de libertades y oportunidades a los ciudadanos esto no es imposible
8649408 no es simplemente una discusi n del modelo econ mico sino sobre cu les son las condiciones m nimas de dignidad que un estado debe generar para los seres humanos y estados ojo no estoy hablando ni de cuba ni de rusia europeos como espa a que son estados con bienestar que garantizan servicios b sicos para sus ciudadanos y eso creo que es un m nimo que aqu en el ecuador no podemos renunciar a plantearnos
8649409 es porque cada uno de los espacios de los sectores de las organizaciones de los movimientos se est n mirando representados por esta constituci n de unas luchas que llevan a os y yo creo que s justifica esta diversidad del s y no me parece que es peligrosa porque no creo que en ning n caso sea condicionada
8649410 yo creo que lo mismo hacen los sectores por el no porque cuando les preguntamos cu l es el problema de la constituci n entonces ellos se justifican por su oposici n a correa
8649411 si la constituci n gana todos como compromiso debemos hacer que sta funcione y la constituci n de por s no es milagrosa no es una varita m gica todos debemos hacer un compromiso antes de conocer los resultados de respetar y obedecer los resultados de ese refer ndum y esa ser la gran diferencia con la constituci n del 98 que al d a siguiente de ser aprobada fue irrespetada por quienes la hicieron y no por la ciudadan a de a pie
8649412 y el ejemplo es la asamblea el presidente nunca dijo como plan b voy a poner diputados estaba tan seguro

8649430 the total alteration in underlying circumstances has not been squarely faced as a result we are guided in part by ideas that are relevant to another world we do many things that are unnecessary some that are unwise and a few that are insane
8649431 lets face it a part of our human nature is to be fearful and focused only on what we want we use violence as a way to solve problems were also greedy if we dont grab it for ourselves the other person might beat us to it in order for us to be safe we have to rely on our leadership to do whatever is necessary to protect us from terrorists and criminals in order for us to get all the things we want and need we have to farm out our production and services to other countries where it wont cost so much to get it into your hands sure it may mean that you have to put up with inferior products and see your jobs go overseas and your home values diminish faster than your mortgage will go down but hang in there folks someday this will all bring you the life you want its all for the best

8649491 this means that from a basic science point of view cafe 2 as 2 offers a clean model system that seems to encompass all of the salient features of these compounds structural magnetic and superconducting phase transitions and that its behavior can be tuned with pressure

8649589 in the wake of wolf cubs death in issue 5 dani moonstar seeks out a former new x man to replace him on the team or it could be a former new x woman you never know im crafty
8649590 two former new mutants hint theyre the sun and the moon
8649591 beyond that the cast of the book will be relatively fluid
8649592 weve got some cool returns of old characters coming up illyana and doug ramsey graymalkin formally joins the team in issue 8 plus theres someone whos already on the team sorta who we havent met yet
8649593 hell remain the prisoner and hell develop a kind of strange relationship with a member of the team in addition the team will visit a krakoa no not the krakoa but a krakoa you mean theres more than one guess so
8649594 basically theyre going to get trained as the next generation of x men la the new mutants and the new x men
8649595 the difference is that those teams were based on a school model whereas cyclops has reformed the x men into an army training in combat tactics will take precedence over say algebra theyll be under the command of two former new mutants and will occasionally go on missions backed up by the x men proper as needed
8649596 theres an x tradition not to be confused with x tradition my upcoming series about mutant immigration enforcement of team members dying on their first adventure going back to uncanny x men 95
8649597 theyve already been teased in the book and theyll be the focus of a two issue arc in issues 8 and 9 the name y men is a little joke they think theyre going to replace the x men but you can imagine that the kids will have something to say about that
8649598 with the internet with cable with the 15 000 journalists that we have here so many more people can experience it

8649600 its about developing the skills and developing the intellect and it teaches you how to be competitive

8649602 if youre a guest you cant sit in these seats
8649603 detracts from that simple faith and devotion to the lord jesus
8649604 who can estimate the holiness and perfection of her who was chosen to be the mother of christ if to him that hath more is given and holiness and divine favour go together and this we are expressly told what must have been the transcendent purity of her whom the creator spirit condescended to overshadow with his miraculous presence what must have been her gifts who was chosen to be the only near earthly relative of the son of god the only one whom he was bound by nature to revere and look up to the one appointed to train and educate him to instruct him day by day as he grew in wisdom and stature this contemplation runs to a higher subject did we dare follow it for what think you was the sanctified state of that human nature of which god formed his sinless son knowing as we do that which is born of the flesh is flesh 1 jn 3 6 and that none can bring a clean thing out of an unclean job 14 4
8649605 truly you are greater than any other greatness for who is your equal in greatness o dwelling place of god the word to whom among all creatures shall i compare you o virgin you are greater than them all o covenant clothed with purity instead of gold you are the ark in which is found the golden vessel containing the true manna that is the flesh in which divinity resides

8649607 thou and thy mother are the only ones who are totally beautiful in every respect for in thee o lord there is no spot and in thy mother no stain
8649608 bodily assumption is said to be the natural effect of being highly favoured or full of grace
8649609 they wrongly assume that this woman is mary and ignore the problems of such interpretation for example the woman of revelation being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered revelation 12 2 whereas catholics believe that mary gave birth to her son without pain pope alexander iii
8649610 christs resurrection is the sure sign of messiahs triumph over the devil
8649611 in the hundred years before pope pius declaration the popes had received petitions from 113 cardinals 250 bishops 32 000 priests and religious brothers 50 000 religious women and 8 million lay people all requesting that the assumption be recognized officially as a catholic teaching

8649621 my brother said they had many tents and vehicles but everything was covered
8649622 they seem to be doing something with the army so its no big deal theyre nice and they have been spending a lot of money which is good for mexicali
8649623 we continue to hear reports from illegals coming across the border that swear they have seen chinese soldiers dressed like mexicans
8649624 no one is paying attention but there is a core of officers who know what is going on and were worried being an ex military guy it scares the hell out of me
8649625 we suddenly find ourselves in a situation where now two communist nations have soldiers on our southern border
8649626 there are two questions you need to ask yourself why isnt our government doing something and what are the mexicans up to
8649627 just as americans were distracted by your election mess the people in mexico are drunk on vincente fox
8649628 they dont care what hes doing yet so no one is paying attention its still a party
8649629 i really dont know whats going on but people in those areas need to keep an open eye and a keen ear
8649630 theyre up to something and i know im getting real nervous
8649631 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure

8649653 we got a decent boost from the stimulus which hit the economy at a time when we really needed it
8649654 it will have less of an impact going forward though and we may even have a payback in the fourth quarter
8649655 we would have had growth even without the stimulus as much of the rise in gdp had to do with the trade deficit
8649656 without a price spiral the fed wont have to squeeze the life out the economy which should help sustain modest economic growth

8649663 the idea was to make this into a big commercial movie
8649664 but even though they liked the script at the studio they just felt it was too sensitive a subject to make as a mainstream release
8649665 in 2002 no one had tried to take on the subject in a commercial way it was a little bit early
8649666 it has to be appealing to both a broad audience and a sophisticated art audience
8649667 we want a smart movie that provokes us and we also want it to play in the rest of the country not just something that people in new york or l a or washington are going to go see
8649668 it was very well observed and didnt feel as if it was shying away from anything
8649669 once you start reading the stories of the real personalities well you cant make this stuff up as they say
8649670 we worked with a lot of islamic and muslim consultants who would read the scripts and give me notes so we tried to do our best to get that part of the story right
8649671 it feels like were being increasingly forced to choose between pure entertainment and thought provoking movies that are good for you but that you dont want to go see
8649672 it looks like they are getting ready for the emperor to arrive
8649673 the facade is metaphor for production purposes but theres not much behind it its the perfect metaphor for barack obamas readiness to be president of the united states

8649678 by my bedside i had copies of tom wolfes the bonfire of the vanities tama janowitzs slaves of new york and issues of spy magazine i would peruse them each night before retiring i used them as a sort of social template to guide myself through the mores and attitudes of new yorkers as research a bit silly perhaps but i could have done worse i found my first year living in new york incredibly hard and very lonely its as if the city tests you after that i felt more and more at home

8649711 im available from now to play every one day international and twenty20 for england
8649712 kp will take the credit for it and you will all write that he got me in a headlock and said youve got to come back and play for me but he wasnt really that important in the decision
8649713 i retired because my head had gone and mentally id lost form but now ive come back
8649714 i was putting the kids to bed for their afternoon sleep at 2pm and i got the phone call
8649715 both mooresy and kp said come and play they werent expecting a full comeback they just needed a favour and said take it to the end of the series and see what happens i spoke to my family and to durham who were great when i came back from new zealand in a poor place and everyone said ive got to play and that was it
8649716 i cant overestimate how much i missed playing for england
8649717 after nearly four and a bit years constantly on the road one days test matches one days test matches inside i was completely knackered and my head had gone i just wasnt bowling well i wasnt enjoying my cricket so i packed it in but id have stopped playing full stop if i thought i wouldnt play for england again
8649718 i could go to south africa to play four day cricket to get ready for the test matches or play one day cricket for england its really a no brainer i had to come back
8649719 if im picked theres not much i can do but ive said to the coach and captain how i feel at the end of the day i have been looking more long term because its about being ready for the test series i retired for cricketing reasons and ive come back out of retirement for cricketing reasons at the minute weve got three games to play against south africa and three games to win which would be a big boost for england going into antigua the winter in india and the west indies as well

8649723 po suppliers are expanding their delivery footprint across onshore in region and offshore delivery locations
8649724 while sourcing focused suppliers are onshore centric and p2p focused suppliers tend to focus on offshore centric models end to end suppliers have developed a healthy mix of onshore in region and offshore ftes almost all po suppliers are beginning to optimize their location strategies as global sourcing starts to play an increasingly important role in the po market
8649725 sanitation and availability of drinking water are going to be highly restrained therefore there is always the possibility of water borne diseases and some epidemics breaking out unless disease surveillance happens and proper health care facilities are provided especially to the vulnerable groups like children and women
8649726 the biggest concern is clearly that the discharge is expected to increase in the coming months it can double
8649727 therefore the biggest threat comes from the water which is coming from upstream so rains will clearly make things much worse

8649798 job seekers in some fields are competing aggressively for open positions giving employers the edge in those segments of the hiring market at the same time however companies continue to face a shortage of highly skilled professionals in fields such as technology and accounting these in demand workers may not be willing to leave secure positions unless firms extend very attractive job offers
8649799 businesses are operating on leaner resources and are competing to secure the intellectual capital that will drive productivity and new revenue streams companies are also replacing lower performing employees to strengthen their talent bench to prepare for a time when the economy shifts into higher gear
8649800 recruiting highly skilled professionals may require a greater financial commitment or special perks that provide a more attractive work environment however nearly three quarters of employees surveyed said the availability of flexible schedules may cause them to choose one job over another
8649801 we want to fix the shortage instead of creating a situation where hospitals have to shift the nursing workload to lesser trained workers

8649805 data from european demographers and statistical bureaus show that a majority of children in sweden and norway are now born out of wedlock as are 60 percent of first born children in denmark
8649806 kurtzs argument which oreilly embraces is that when legal rights are accorded to gays through some unspecified process heterosexual couples begin bearing children out of wedlock and refuse to marry when they otherwise would there are many government policies that alter the incentives to get and stay married and thus have direct and unsurprising effects on marriage for instance the availability of no fault divorce leads to more divorces and laws providing the same rights for cohabitating heterosexual couples as married couples lead to fewer marriages as couples make private commitments to each other without seeking the imprimatur of the state but neither kurtz nor oreilly has provided a plausible justification for their belief that extending rights to gay couples harms heterosexual marriage
8649807 back at national review online contributing editor stanley kurtz makes the same point
8649808 the replacement of a traditional ethic of sacrifice by a post 60s ethos of self fulfillment
8649809 nursing was once built around a spirit of feminine compassion and sacrifice in the new feminist world that is unacceptable
8649810 i think the vote of no confidence in lawrence summers is a wonderful thing harvard continues to discredit itself with the american public the faculty is trapped if summers resigns this extraordinary example of political correctness will come back to haunt harvard and the entire academy for years but if summers hangs on the faculty itself will have been humiliated checked by the very fact of public scrutiny either way harvard is tearing itself apart so long as the public simply writes of the academy the mice can play but the intense public scrutiny in this case puts the captains of political correctness into a no win situation like the closely watched susan estrich fiasco this battle is doing lasting damage to the cultural left as they say sunlight is the best disinfectant

8649888 yang jelas sahur itu merupakan suatu perbuatan yang mengikuti sunnah berbeda dengan perbuatan ahli kitab memelihara terhadap ibadah menambah semangat menolak pengaruh buruk yang ditimbulkan oleh rasa lapar atau merupakan kesempatan bersedekah kepada orang lain dengan mengundangnya makan sahur bersama dan juga dapat dilanjutkan dengan merzikir atau berdoa karena waktu sahur adalah waktu yang mustajab untuk berdoa
8649889 apabila salah seorang di antara kalian mendengar azan subuh padahal bejana masih berada di tangannya maka janganlah ia meletakkan bejana itu sampai ia menyelesaikan kebutuhannya itu
8649890 aku pernah bertanya kepada jabir tentang seseorang yang bermaksud untuk puasa sementara bejana di tangannya siap untuk diminum kemuadian ia mendengar azan
8649891 aku datang menemui nabi saw untuk memebritahukan shalat fajar kepada beliau dan beliau bermaksud untuk berpuasa maka beliau meminjam bejana lalu beliau minum kemudian beliau memberikannya padaku maka aku pun minum pula
8649892 adalah alqamah bin alatsah berada di samping rasulullah saw kemudian datanglah bilal untuk memberitahu waktu shalat kepada nabi maka rasulullah saw pun bersabda perlahan lahan hai bilal aqamah sedang sahur
8649893 sesungguhnya kami golongan para nabi diperintahkan untuk menyegerakan berbuka dan mengakhirkan sahur dan supaya kami meletakkan tangan kanan kami di atas tangan kiri kami di dalam shalat
8649894 agama akan senantiasa tampak syiarnya dengan nyata selama orang islam berbuka puasa dengan segera tepat pada waktunya sebab orang orang yahudi dan nasrani melambatkannya

8649900 demi allah yang menggenggam jiwa muhammad sesungguhnya bau mulut orang yang sedang berpuasa itu lebih harum di sisi allah daripada bau minyak kesturi dan bagi orang yang berpuasa itu ada dua kegembiraan ketika berbuka ia bersuka cita dengan datangnya saat berbuka dan ketika bertemu dengan tuhannya ia brsuka cita dengan pahala puasanya dalam hadis lain disebutkan rasulullah saw bersabda
8649901 sesungguhnya rasulullah saw pernah mencium sebagian istri istrinya padahal beliau sedang berpuasa
8649902 barangsiapa yang berbuka puasa pada bulan ramadhan lantaran lupa maka tidak wajib qadha dan tidak wajib kifarat
8649903 barangsiapa yang meninggal dan punya hutang puasa hendaklah walinya berpuasa untuknya
8649904 kami pernah bersafar bersama nabi saw maka orang yang berpuasa tidak mencela orang yang berbuka dan sebaliknya orang yang berbuka tidak mencela orang yang berpuasa
8649905 barangsiapa lupa ketika berpuasa lalu makan atau minum maka hendaknya puasanya itu dia teruskan sampai selesai karena allah sesungguhnya telah memberinya makan dan minum
8649906 sesungguhnya allah telah memaafkan dari umatku kekeliruan lupa dan hal hal yang mereka terpaksa melakukannya
8649907 bukankah apabila ia perempuan sedang haid maka ia tidak shalat dan tidak berpuasa maka demikian itu kurangnya din agama mereka
8649908 kami mengalami hal yang demikian bersama rasulullah lalu kami diperintahkan mengqadha puasa tetapi kami tidak diperintahkan mengqadha shalat
8649909 dan wajib bagi orang orang yang berat menjalankannya jika mereka tidak berpuasa membayah fidyah yaitu memberi makan seorang miskin
