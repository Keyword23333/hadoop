7490000 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7490001 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness

7490006 people thought that i was injured because i was covered with blood but it wasnt from injuries of mine it was of others only god saved me
7490007 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7490008 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7490009 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs
7490010 the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defense foreign affairs and oil revenues
7490011 the original biden plan seems less relevant in iraq today than at any point
7490012 the trend in parliament is clearly in a more national direction with political parties coming together across sectarian divides
7490013 in other words there is a very strong iraqi mobilization against precisely the core elements of the biden plan and it would be extremely unwise of the democratic party to make bidens ideas the centerpiece of their iraq strategy
7490014 we dont support establishing federal regions on a sectarian basis for example our region is not ethnic it contains kurds and non kurds the regions should be established on a geographic basis
7490015 his project was the reason behind the unity of many political blocs that once differed in viewpoints
7490016 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations

7490036 as an example of the team atmosphere he said to me im very sorry im very sorry and it was not his fault it just shows how ferrari people are the passion that they have the way they behave and the professionalism that they put in every day we need to be very proud of the guys who work in this team
7490037 the system works in the following way when the fuel nozzle is connected to the car you see that there is a red light on at a certain moment you see that there is a flashing light that is close to the red light telling the driver that he has to be ready then as soon as the nozzle comes off the light becomes green unless the guy that is controlling the pit stop position overrides it manually because there is a car in the fast lane coming through so he has to delay the car that is how the system works weve used it since last year
7490038 i dont think so to be honest when there is a red flight its a red light its like the lollypop is down i dont think that we need to go towards that depth of course we need to make sure that the system is always working that is something that we have to make sure but this is another story

7490068 for the people with money this was not a problem
7490069 im not sure we need this status people come to edinburgh to see the buildings and the setting not to read the label i would say what has happened is we have added value to the unesco brand not the other way round
7490070 its nice to have these things but no one comes to edinburgh because it has world heritage site status whereas unesco having edinburgh on its list will have added great value
7490071 the most important thing is its location and architectural heritage its the real buildings that matter not the ticket you put on them
7490072 edinburgh is a brand that has a distinct image around the world whs status is all very good but is it more than just something we like to have
7490073 edinburghs world renowned architectural heritage and landscape setting underpins much of the capitals economic success
7490074 the world heritage site status of the old and new towns is a representation of this uniqueness its clear value and the international standing of the city
7490075 it is not enough to simply be a historic site for example york and chester are not world heritage sites or to be an important site in the history of the nation you have to show that your site is unique with a story that is so compelling it helps us to understand the way all humankind has evolved over time to have a body such as unesco make that kind of judgement about edinburgh is surely the highest accolade possible
7490076 edinburgh world heritage regularly hosts delegations from across the world who come here precisely because the city has this international recognition
7490077 if world heritage status were to be removed from edinburgh it would be extremely damaging
7490078 it would lower edinburgh in the eyes of the rest of the world if we were seen not to be particularly concerned with the conservation of our historic environment because thats the message it would send out
7490079 it might be difficult to calculate the benefit it has brought but its easy to see the disbenefit if it was withdrawn

7490089 the executive council which has the power to confirm appointees and approve state contracts switched from 4 1 republican to 3 2 democratic the state senate which republicans controlled 16 8 is now democratic by a 14 10 margin the state house of representatives which is dwarfed in size only by the british house of commons and the u s house of representatives went from 242 150 republican with eight vacancies to 239 161 democratic

7490091 scientists in the department of biology amp biochemistry at the university of bath have started a three year study into the junctions that hold cells together giving insight into how cancer cells can break off and spread to other parts of the body
7490092 yale university scientists today reported evidence suggesting that the tiny cilia found on brain cells of mammals thought to be vestiges of a primeval past actually play a critical role in relaying molecular signals that spur creation of neurons in an area of the brain involved in mood learning and memory
7490093 two independent research groups have found that simultaneous inhibition of two signaling pathways resulted in substantially enhanced antitumor effects in mouse models of prostate and breast cancer in an accompany commentary steven grant at virginia commonwealth university health science center richmond discusses the clinical importance of these studies and highlights some of the questions that still need to be answered
7490094 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7490095 we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7490096 black youths within this country have been left to die thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed

7490102 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
7490103 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
7490104 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
7490105 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
7490106 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
7490107 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals

7490110 i cannot support these radical measures which i believe violate the fundamental rights of rural property owners
7490111 intended to transfer protection of the relevant critical areas from the gma to the sma only as municipalities enact and ecology approves new shoreline master programs deciding otherwise does violence to the legislatures clearly expressed purpose
7490112 this surprising interpretation makes it that much tougher to save puget sound by 2020
7490113 rcw 82 02 020 generally prohibits counties from imposing any tax fee or charge on the development of land
7490114 we have repeatedly held as the statutes require that development conditions must be tied to a specific identified impact of the development on a community
7490115 king county has failed in its burden to show that the critical areas ordinance falls within any exception to the imposition of those limitations to development accordingly we hold that the ordinance must give way to the state statute
7490116 important to both government land use regulators and the development community
7490117 the decision adds to the growing body of case law interpreting rcw 82 02 020 and the showing that a government must make to support imposing a land use fee or restriction on a proposed development
7490118 whether the citys findings are constitutionally sufficient to justify the conditions imposed on dolans permit
7490119 the necessary connection required by the fifth amendment is rough proportionality no precise mathematical calculation is required but the city must make some sort of individualized determination that the required dedication is related both in nature and extent to the proposed developments impact
7490120 if this ruling stands it will have far reaching and negative impacts on local governments ability to regulate land use
7490121 forces rural property owners to pay to protect the environment from urban land uses in stream and river areas
7490122 set aside requirement is automatically imposed on all rural lots whether or not a specific development project will have any effect on a stream or river environment this case presents a classic example of a policy decision to shift the costs and burdens of mitigating harms created by the cumulative impact of development onto a discrete group of property owners

7490146 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
7490147 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
7490148 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness

7490153 carl woese and his colleagues years ago established that protein translation had to be well developed when the evolution of modern cells started
7490154 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
7490155 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
7490156 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
7490157 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
7490158 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
7490159 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles

7490179 we cannot comment specifically on applications made to the criminal injuries compensation authority in order to protect applicants confidentiality
7490180 cica operates under the criminal injuries compensation scheme 2001 as set down by parliament the scheme sets the levels of compensation depending on the injuries sustained
7490181 there is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that behaviour particularly that of children and young people is being criminalised which arguably would be better dealt with informally school related misbehaviour for example and in previous times was
7490182 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system
7490183 the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7490184 the trend towards pre court summary justice should more incisively be scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively
7490185 not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised

7490204 its no longer that way these days there are nuns from africa and latin america who are really very very lovely the brazilians particularly
7490205 the whole team is stoked to be sitting at the top of the perch
7490206 they expected to be close to the top following two home turf events but the fields for the first two stops of the tour were strong
7490207 this was one of the most important things that these kids needed to do to integrate into the organization its also a great opportunity for the staff out here to get to know them
7490208 the connection with the staff out here was the biggest goal of the camp and i think we achieved it
7490209 just seeing how the staff works back at the offices is definitely something to benefit from
7490210 getting to meet people and seeing the people who try to help us do what we do was fun
7490211 some of them have been doing training as part of their academy programs but many have not so its important for us to emphasize the importance of physical condition that theyre going to require to be champions of the world
7490212 hooking up with the best sport science department in the world as the ussa is it doesnt get any better than that
7490213 ive been working out and trying to get as strong as i can to be injury free and getting new exercises from the trainer helps a lot
7490214 i work with a trainer back home but getting a new perspective and a different workout from what i normally do was great
7490215 learning about routines we should do before we drop in to the halfpipe and getting used to being pressured was really beneficial
7490216 it was quite a challenging course in that it was long and included seven major features but the standard of performance was really strong
7490217 shelley gotlieb always rides hard and strong and put in a solid performance to win the womens snowboard event
7490218 if more people can realize how good it is down here we can really grow the nz freeski scene
7490219 the nz open should be the kick off to the year every year
7490220 this is the highest quality field the nz open has hosted to date
7490221 the athletes at the event today were really impressive the level was as high as that of the worlds biggest events and the tricks that were being thrown were phenomenal
7490222 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7490223 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7490224 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7490225 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt is premature so im enjoying my retired life right now
7490226 altameds family health and wellness center in el monte is the culmination of years of work to develop a model of service that meets the health needs of every family member at every age
7490227 this unique model will serve as a vehicle to address the health crisis in this medically underserved area and can be duplicated in communities across the nation
7490228 the opening of the altamed family health and wellness center serves as a powerful example of what dedicated advocates can do to minimize the effects of our health care crisis on our most vulnerable populations for more than 39 years altamed has served as a passionate champion on this issue
7490229 i am proud to stand here with them today to celebrate what will be a treasured resource in our community
7490230 i am very grateful for altameds adhc at the family health and wellness center because it allows me to look forward to something during the day and provides me and my family with the medical and emotional support we need
7490231 being at altamed is like being with your second family they truly make sure you receive the care you need

7490234 hampered by years of violence a decimated infrastructure a lack of foreign investors and a flood of imports that undercut local businesses iraqs private sector particularly its small non oil economy has so far failed to flourish as its american patrons had hoped in its absence the iraqi government has been sustaining the economy the way it always has by putting citizens on its payroll since 2005 according to federal budgets the number of government employees has nearly doubled to 2 3 million from 1 2 million the impetus is not only economic in exchange for abandoning the insurgency that plunged the nation into civil war many of the 100 000 members of civilian patrols known broadly as the awakening movement have been promised jobs in the security forces or in reconstruction though many sunni muslim members complain it is not happening quickly enough
7490235 but this growth has not come without problems already a huge wage increase to government workers that was instituted but then suspended because of fears that it was pushing up inflation has underscored the difficulties of being far and away the largest employer in an unstable country in 2006 31 percent of iraqs labor force was working in the public sector according to the agency for statistics in the ministry of planning the agency expects that figure to reach 35 percent this year about 5 percentage points short of where the c i a estimated it to be on the eve of the 2003 invasion
7490236 this figure is not atypical for the region but it hardly indicates the free market state initially envisioned by the united states led coalition provisional authority which pushed for full and rapid privatization in its first few months
7490237 well these people are poor we need to help them
7490238 but to combat unemployment a factor contributing to much of iraqs violence there are few other options right now nothing sent recent graduates and out of work iraqis scrambling to land civil service jobs more than the hefty raises that went into effect in june given how large a proportion of the countrys population is on the government payroll this series of wage increases like the two that came before in 2003 and 2007 was essentially a form of widespread economic relief the salaries of many iraqis were more than doubled some economic advisers and members of parliament worried that a raise for government workers could be a nightmare for others when a sudden flood of cash poured into the market they argued that the raises should be phased in gradually to prevent a spike in inflation which at around 14 percent a sea change from two years ago when it neared 70 percent has largely been tamed by a disciplined fiscal policy robust oil revenues and an influx of low cost imports
7490239 the long term answer to iraqs economic problems several lawmakers said is a thriving free market alternative there has been some success new business registration is up nearly 14 percent this year but the process is slow the private sector does not exist now said hasan al shammari the head of the fadhila party in parliament because there is no infrastructure the iraqi government has set aside money to help small businesses secure credit it has also begun pushing for the creation of private banks has taken steps toward privatizing some state owned enterprises and has aggressively encouraged investment the booming telecommunications industry is one bright spot the 2008 budget even includes an item that enables the government to cover half the salary for two years of a civil servant who transfers to the private sector
7490240 but for most iraqis the challenge is getting on the government payroll not getting off and they are going at it the iraqi way leaning on friends and relatives with connections and scraping up money for the inevitable bribe typically a months salary like so much else in iraq getting a job is complicated by politics and sectarianism while the minority sunni muslims run a handful of ministries they are all but barred from some others the policy of de baathification aimed at rooting out loyalists to saddam hussein after the american led invasion resulted in a de facto purge of high ranking sunni bureaucrats a purge that continued informally in certain offices that were permeated by shiite militias
7490241 abdul aama 65 once owned a shoe factory and shop that employed 30 workers now he employs only one on a recent weekday morning the shop off the once teeming rashid street downtown now largely blocked by blast walls was empty few of the shoes on display were iraqi made after the fall of the regime all the factories closed mr aama said cheap chinese imports began pouring into the market a boon to the poor but a bane to the local shoe industry and the unreliable electricity did the rest
7490242 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7490243 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7490244 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget

7490271 most important scheunemanns former lobbying firm orion strategies received at lest 800 000 from the government of georgia between 2004 and may 15 2008 when scheunemann finally severed his ties officially at least to the firm
7490272 before that between january 1 2007 and may 15 2008 scheunemann was officially on the payroll as both georgias lobbyist and mccains top adviser during which time georgia paid orion and 290 000 and mccain paid him 70 000
7490273 others who were once uneasy about the influence of conservatives on mr mccain say that their worries have not been realized even as mr mccain has taken conservative positions
7490274 this is the situation in which the interventionists have placed our country committed to go to war for countries and causes that do not justify war against a russia that is re emerging as a great power only to find nato squatting on her doorstep

7490314 the balikbayan box could very well be seen as the strongest symbol of filipino migration it continues to project the hope of many filipinos that migration is the only way to improve their economic condition and that of their families
7490315 believing that until this time the issues are not yet being given much attention in our society
7490316 the absence of the mother in the family has great ill effects in the upbringing of children
7490317 as more balikbayan boxes appear at our airports our concern for the welfare of the migrants and their families especially the children left behind becomes more frightening
7490318 ecmi continues to hope with the filipino people for a socio political and economic change in our country which would provide better work opportunities for every filipino worker here in our very own country so that our countrymen will not be forced to leave their homes at the expense of the proper growth of their families and children
7490319 after all they are doing our country and society significant economic support through their work and sacrifices
7490320 social costs of migration a deep concern for the church
7490321 the usual dream which he had preceding nearly every great and important event of the war generally the news had been favorable which preceded this dream and the dream itself was always the same he said that he seemed to be in some singular indescribable vessel and that he was moving with great rapidity towards an indefinite shore that he had this dream preceding sumter bull run antietam gettysburg stones river vicksburg wilmington etc
7490322 stones river was certainly no victory and he knew of no great results which followed from it
7490323 this strange dream again last night and we shall judging from the past have great news very soon i think it must be from sherman
7490324 im sorry lady but your man has said his last goodbye
7490325 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time

7490329 for a state police agency or one of its agents to investigate a reporter who has produced legitimate and critically important coverage of the agency smacks of the intimidation and retribution you would expect to find in a totalitarian state
7490330 whether this was truly the actions of one rogue officer or whether it was condoned by his supervisors
7490331 for a state police agency or one of its agents to investigate a reporter who has produced legitimate and critically important coverage of the agency smacks of the intimidation and retribution you would expect to find in a totalitarian state
7490332 comme dautres sont rouge aux 13 c pages gigondas lacave est celle des 7 terroirs majeurs
7490333 we expect that both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be received from provincial territorial and federal partners
7490334 the surveillance system picked up a problem that was occurring and allowed us to respond efficiently and effectively to an emerging public health issue
7490335 this is an example of where our surveillance system worked
7490336 in those terms certainly i think this was a success
7490337 when theres a loss of life involved it is always tragic it should force us to review our protocols review how we deal with things and see if there are better ways we can do things
7490338 but once we were award of the situation federal officials acted very quickly
7490339 sadness hopelessness fear anger i think its impossible for anyone to understand the state of the earth without feeling these emotions in our controlled culture were not welcome to act out our despair in public but we do need to let ourselves feel what we feel strong emotions are entirely appropriate and they could be the motive force for reversing the gloomy trends which are almost all reversible the only way we will ever engage in a shift to new sustainable ways of living is by caring and feeling i dont know about you but when i really let myself experience the state of the world my first reaction is bottomless unutterable sorrow that moves quickly into outrage the sorrow i can deal with the outrage i used to suppress after all it might offend someone now i use it to give me courage when i get mad i have to move with half suppressed anger i tend to swing out and do something impetuous and ignorant but a fully felt grounded familiar anger can move me through a lifetime commitment to make things better feelings like knowledge dont directly change anything but if we dont rush past the feelings or stuff them down if we take time to admit even the most uncomfortable ones to accept them share them and couple them with knowledge of what is wrong and how it might be fixed then feelings and knowledge together are the motor for change the feelings make the doings of a technological cultural economic and political revolution inevitable unstoppable
7490340 you never take pictures of something you want to forget

7490346 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7490347 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7490348 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind us thousands of prisoners
7490349 its not easy to release prisoners especially prisoners that were involved directly in terrorist acts against innocent civilians
7490350 there is no doubt that we seek peace and we are trying to seek our goals and there wont be peace without the release of all prisoners
7490351 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7490352 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens

7490370 and believe me when you see someone dying of aids its really bad its different each time no one dies the same way
7490371 this aids study was it seems the beginning of many years of research being carried out on me without my knowledge or consent
7490372 if as the ethics application form states consent was obtained from all subjects how is it that i did not know about my aids status until 1987
7490373 i did not know anything about his studies or research

7490382 this is a disgraceful decision and defies common sense there was clearly no intention on the part of the teacher to deliberately insult the islamic faith
7490383 its impossible to know but its clear that this is a government that likes to distract people
7490384 elements of the government that are upset about the embarrassment
7490385 what has happened was not haphazard or carried out of ignorance but rather a calculated action and another ring in the circles of plotting against islam
7490386 it is part of the campaign of the so called war against terrorism and the intense media campaign against islam
7490387 this outcry along with the increasing opposition being voiced by liberals civil libertarians and assorted national political figures

7490389 the evidence is contradictory the forensic analysis is limited and almost all the witnesses have an obvious bias or prejudice
7490390 yet the government still pursued a multi million dollar investigation in order to appease an anti war politician and the blame america first media now we have the absurd situation of lt col chessani being charged with failing to report and investigate a crime that never occurred
7490391 there was no firefight there was no ied that killed these innocent people our troops overreacted because of the pressure on them and they killed innocent civilians in cold blood
7490392 they all showed a bias that these men were guilty before an investigation was complete
7490393 its frustrating to me as a former marine that a lot of reporters media types and politicians have the worldview from the 1960s that never changed they wanted to make this the new my lai because they have tried from the beginning to make this the new vietnam
7490394 the verdict is already in and it is not in the u s s favor while gen peter pace chairman of the joint chiefs of staff assures us that 99 9 percent of our servicemen and women are behaving humanely the majority of the iraqis confess no surprise at learning about the war crimes of the u s soldiers
7490395 the statement minimizes the sacrifices israel has made misrepresents the
7490396 thus it starts small waves that may gather momentum and wreak havoc later in the form of pressure on israel to produce incentives to show progress

7490399 i have no doubt that the reality created in our region in 1967 will change significantly while this will be an extremely difficult process for many of us it is nevertheless inevitable i know it many of my people know it we are ready for it
7490400 it will be incapable of removing 80 000 to 120 000 jews from their homes in the west bank
7490401 keep in mind that while there was a disagreement in this country over whether gaza is really part of the biblical land of israel theres really no disagreement about whether the west bank judea and samaria are part of the land of israel it is universally acknowledged here
7490402 if it is in the interest of all the attendees in containing iran except syria then what sense is there in turning over more territory that will be taken over by hamas which is funded by iran
7490403 locking families out of the american dream by offering mortgages too good to be true
7490404 every government leader and business executive i have met in developing countries from the mayor of beijing to the ruler of the united arab emirates is eager for one thing u s style capitalism to build their economies create jobs and wealth for their people and bring their countries fully into the global trading network

7490408 every human activity now needs to be measured by its impact on water and the water commons
7490409 it is a flagrant violation of human rights when only the rich have access to clean water
7490410 its still easy for a policymaker to distance themselves from a purely environmental issue but it is much harder for them to ignore a public health issues
7490411 fifty years of development have wiped out local knowledge and skills about conserving and cooperating around water
7490412 were already part of many networks and campaigns weve come here in a state of inquiry how do we make a water commons revolution
7490413 while 61 of americans say the effects of global warming have already begun
7490414 killing large swaths of sea life and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage
7490415 there are now 405 identified dead zones worldwide up from 49 in the 1960s
7490416 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
7490417 on every continent one can find empowered rural communities developing gm free agro ecological farming systems theyre succeeding the largest overview study looking at farmers transitioning to sustainable practices in 57 countries involving almost 13 million small farmers on almost 100 million acres found after four years that average yields were up 79 percent
7490418 our success as a species did not come about because we imposed our values on nature as a survival strategy domination is doomed our outmoded engineering technologies require us to exert too much command and control over nature in an endless cycle of tyranny genetic engineering has misled us into believing that we have to reformulate nature according to our own designs even if it works its a dead end strategy because it forces us to live within the extremely limited confines of the human imagination
7490419 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil
7490420 will mccains cynical lies destroy the chance for serious energy and climate policy
7490421 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended
7490422 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
7490423 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
7490424 clearly they have chosen the path of arrogance unilateralism thats a serious blow to confidence building in the talks
7490425 we are not going to allow the election to go ahead without our members even a single one we will not allow them to rig this process

7490427 he was a very fit man and it was a blow when he got cancer he was given no time at all particularly for someone who was so fit
7490428 the only time dino went home was when he went to the gym
7490429 dino was instrumental in building one of the sports most successful aerodynamics departments which helped the team win double drivers and constructors titles in 2005 and 2006
7490430 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
7490431 we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently
7490432 from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point will have a great value
7490433 we have to be as competitive as at budapest but we need to raise our reliability we cant repeat certain mistakes we dont have any more excuses

7490455 the ice creams the best and i love the old fashioned theme thats going on
7490456 the longer were in this the more its a lifestyle
7490457 i dont really like the movement were seeing today toward exotic ice cream flavors
7490458 i hearken back to a time when the only flavors were strawberry chocolate and vanilla
7490459 theyd have to roll us out on carts if we each had our own

7490461 i have proven myself against australia in the past and was looking forward to play against them but i have absolutely no clue what could be the reason for not picking me after being in the loop and being called up for the camp in bangalore
7490462 buddhist believers assembly denouncing the lee myung bak administrations destruction of the constitution and religious discrimination
7490463 most of the killing in the world originates in religious conflict
7490464 hears the administration is working to correct the religious discrimination
7490465 the protests will spread to the provinces until the president promises to prevent future discrimination and carries out that promise
7490466 we say its just as important to wash your inside as your outside so weve got to get them enthusiastic and i hope theyre gradually getting a taste for clean water
7490467 some of the mothers were a bit nervous about ooh rainwater pond water is what weve been using you know boiled pond water but a bit murky
7490468 we got a letter from the pasteur institute which said the water is fine so the mothers are feeling pretty relaxed now about this nice clean water
7490469 for me hes a fulfilment of what the buddhist story is all about being satisfied with life being happy you can tell hes happy because hes always laughing and smiling
7490470 thats something that you dont always see in abbots around south east asia and even australia sometimes theyre a bit grumpy
7490471 but hes never grumpy are you youre never grumpy particularly when you get two lots of cement out of me two tonnes
7490472 always cheer me up always cheer me up you do when i think its too hard or too hot you cheer me up
7490473 you see a lot more monks now than you used to there used to be not too many monks around cause a lot of them were killed and now you see monks going out on their dhyana rounds in the morning

7490477 he will be remembered as someone who kept the governor in the game during a period when he could have been shut down by a legislature that was united against him
7490478 it gives whoever is the next senate president an opportunity to really kind of create a different image
7490479 i think this is a once in a decade maybe two decades kind of opportunity
7490480 the main impact of the power is to be able to stop something from happening rather than being able to make it happen
7490481 thats a lot of power in one persons hands maybe too much
7490482 it was a similar process under republicans im not so sure it was quite so top driven as this has been
7490483 i think our issues here are much more clear about where we need to go and i think for the large part most of the people are on the same page
7490484 so youre not going to see that type of division divisiveness thats going to go on
7490485 its still out as to whether its going to be good or bad

7490493 just because we didnt put scriptural addresses with their numbers and colons at every allusion in the story does not mean that the bible isnt the key source in virtually every conversation mack has with god scriptural teachings and references appear on almost every page they are reworded in ways to be relevant to those reading the story but at every point we sought to be true to the way god has revealed himself in the bible except for the literary characterizations that move the story forward at its core the book is one long bible study as mack seeks to resolve his anger at god

7490510 i was surprised to learn how many people had been watching us waiting for us to finish
7490511 it was neat to hear so many were anxious to see us get open
7490512 we wanted to be more than a shopping need but a place where families could drop by in the afternoon and kids could pick out a little treat
7490513 some have already started looking out for us wanting to make sure we succeed
7490514 what was more important to me though was that customers seem to be taking a bit of ownership in this place which is great
7490515 itll be a long process but in order to get people to change their habits of just driving by this intersection well have to make sure we stay consistent with the standards we and the neighborhood want

7490537 one hopes that the prospect of a half naked 54 year old english woman being lashed until she bleeds in a square in downtown khartoum is not something that the british government will tolerate for more than five seconds

7490549 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7490550 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term

7490557 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7490558 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7490559 we will not rest until the prisoners are freed and the jails are empty
7490560 we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7490561 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7490562 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations

7490565 he may drive a ford escape hybrid now but its hard to forget the blingy chrysler 300c was his whip until his media handlers took charge
7490566 like mccain himself its getting a second wind thanks to rising gas prices
7490567 obama has been a vocal supporter of biodiesel and each of the detroit carmakers is planning diesel for their big trucks
7490568 its a new turbo diesel estimated at 50 mpg on the highway
7490569 obamacans will flock to it along with some of the other 300 000 plus buyers who line up for the accord each year
7490570 obama wants 4 billion for detroit to build new small cars and ford is already planning on building it in north america
7490571 they could use the incentives to make a hybrid or diesel version for real 50 mpg capability
7490572 it was perhaps a little too extravagant for a democrat
7490573 now hes driving the politicians stand by a ford escape hybrid but he hasnt been able to shake the 300c image
7490574 throw mitt romney in the back seat have him come up with a way to lop 5000 off the sticker price and its a deal
7490575 the prius is poised for an even stronger second wind under mccain
7490576 you can refill it at home and you can get natural gas from domestic sources
7490577 mccain wants more nuclear power which will help keep the volt charged up and hes in favor of tax credits for zero carbon emission cars
7490578 giving power to the people doesnt have to involve fossil fuels
7490579 and this proves mccain is as green as republicans come

7490581 parents looking for a way to educate their children to be responsible with their money find that prepaid cards provide an excellent teaching method because they give the child the chance to be independent and even purchase goods online but there is a strict budget in place this can be handy for everyday life or perhaps if a child is going on a school trip where they need cash

7490588 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7490589 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7490590 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7490591 recent further price increases in raw materials have been larger than tmcs cost reduction efforts are able to offset
7490592 the case comes down to individual rights versus political correctness
7490593 at heart this is a case involving very base motivations
7490594 max and erla had a dream with respect to the provisions of their will and if you will it it is no dream
7490595 the question arises as to whether the grandchild would be resurrected upon marrying the jewish spouse
7490596 my father let my son aron know he wasnt happy with the idea of diluting the familys jewishness
7490597 credit crunch or not all senior managers need to have visible positive oversight of their organisations it strategy and be able to understand and demonstrate that risks are managed and corporate objectives are supported and achieved
7490598 to make savings by stalling spend on it infrastructure would be short sighted but nonetheless any ways of cutting costs right now are welcome and savings such as these will hopefully provide the spur that company leaders need to fulfil their it governance obligations
7490599 the olympic games attracts many thousands of people to the host country both during and after the event currency retailers offering easy access to yuan and currencies from neighbouring countries will certainly have benefitted from increased sales from the olympic games looking beyond the games foreign currency retailers can expect yuan to remain in demand as china continues to reap the tourism benefits for years to come

7490601 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue

7490608 whosoever acquires any influence here can obtain his share of legal plunder
7490609 the only one back with any experience from last year is ryan viana who was a back up behind george anderson and two years ago jordan dalrymple averaged about four or five snaps a game so other than those two we really have no significant game experience we do have an inexperienced group
7490610 we have had good linebackers in the past and our younger guys have seen how they practiced and how they played and how they prepared themselves and i think that really helps them out
7490611 hes a guy who has been with us for five years and understands the game really well
7490612 he aligns our defense gets us in all the right call and everything like that thats probably his greatest attribute that he is a smart savvy football player
7490613 he just need to continue to understand how he fits into everything and practice every snap he brings a lot of things to the field
7490614 its kind of weird starting all over again with cincinnati
7490615 i played in my first game against cincinnati so hopefully i could do the same as i did or do better
7490616 we moved him and hes been real solid as a backup behind viana
7490617 hes a little bit smaller guy but he runs extremely well
7490618 hes very powerful he has a passion for the game and he is a very physical player he will take on anybody anywhere
7490619 the knee injury has slowed him down and he really hasnt had a chance to show himself
7490620 hes a guy who we think will have a great future especially when he puts on a few pounds
7490621 97 horton 14x70 vinyl shingle siding 3 bdrm 2 bath all electric ready to move into
7490622 chris coy is a starter but all these guys came out and had a great camp
7490623 there are lots of names and lots of possibilities with this group
7490624 it will be interesting to see who out of this group rises up and secures the bulk of the playing time
7490625 ive always had the philosophy that you play as many guys as you can
7490626 one of our biggest things is playing as a unit we have a lot of guys who like playing together and i play a lot of guys so we well never have a year where we dont have guys who arent experienced theyve all been in the wars
7490627 i really dont have to do too much when youve got guys like chris harris chris hall yameen thomas and andrew soucy they play hard everyday its easy when youve got guys like that
7490628 hes a physical kid and hes played a lot of games and hes pretty athletic i expect him to have a big season

7490861 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7490862 this year superdelegates comprised 20 percent of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7490863 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating
7490864 everybody sees a real need for us to reform the way we do this
7490865 its such an emotional issue in those states that its very unlikely thats going to change
7490866 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7490867 this year superdelegates comprised 20 percent of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7490868 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating
7490869 the devil is in the details and thats not something to get into in a national convention
7490870 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7490871 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7490872 we discussed that if the pace was slow then he would go fast because if he ran too slowly then the pack would catch up with him and could be difficult for him to shake them off
7490873 he started the first five and 10 kilometres fast his coach also advised him to assess the opposition its hot and humid in beijing and thats why it was important for wanjiru to run fast in the lead group so that by the time the temperatures rise it would be difficult for the chasing pack to get him
7490874 it was important initially for wanjiru to stay with the lead pack to assess the other runners but he did extremely well by taking over the race early
7490875 there were several attempts to drop me completely but i fought on i wanted to be the first but im the second thats sport and im happy with my result
7490876 i followed my plan at first i was in the lead pack a few metres before the finish line i started to speed up and overtake the leaders in case i lagged behind
7490877 the kenyan athletes sometimes ran fast but sometimes they ran slowly i think that was the tactic they used and that was the main problem for me
7490878 i had a problem with my stomach i started to feel it from the 15th kilometre when i came to beijing i felt a lot better but the stomach was a big problem it also gave me bad headaches
7490879 i was happy to be selected to the kenyan team and thats why i came here and had to forgo the big city marathons
7490880 we identified the need to have a good local partner with whom we can offer our standard of services to our global clients in cambodia and laos
7490881 we did leave for a year to live in greece and rented out the flat while we were away
7490882 we returned from greece on the shared condition we would take out a loan to install some central heating now it feels permanent
7490883 we came back from greece ten years ago and it was then that we decided to make a commitment to edinburgh that was where we wanted to be and the central heating works beautifully
7490884 id be lying in bed writing my journal with a pair of gloves on it was terribly uncomfortable there was no central heating and the washing machine leaked id never been so cold in my life
7490885 it all felt exciting and wonderful though for all the discomfort it felt glamorous being in a damp flat trying to write and getting accustomed to the weather
7490886 a man kicking a mat in frustration on his way into a stadium before a race is quietly re edited to make it look like hes kicking it on the way out after the race the laws of time are bent once again british television industry comes crashing to its knees
7490887 we regret that these pictures were not shown in chronological order
7490888 going green gives tourism businesses advice on environmental impact helping them take the first step to becoming more sustainable we are committed to working with the industry to make scotland one of the most sustainable tourism destinations in europe
7490889 im a small government guy but when it comes to a work ethic i find myself siding with the left humans need work and they need to see that their work has a purpose come to think of it youll hear that from any of americas countless business gurus were all marxists now
7490890 meanwhile atri received a call from a jewellery shop owner who informed that a gold chain was purchased on his credit card this came as a surprise for atri who told the shopkeeper that he had surrendered the card
7490891 we registered a case on the complaint of atri and arrested goyal from the rohini branch of icici bank the other two were arrested at the instance of goyal during interrogation it was revealed that goyal is the manager of i process an outsourcing private company of icici bank dealing with credit card users whereas accused ashish katyan and dev aggarwal were working as recovery agents in another collection agency
7490892 the accused used to contact the customers and introduced themselves using a fake name then they used to send ashish katyan for collecting the card from consumers instead of blocking the cards the three used to go shopping
7490893 whats that i think this phone call is for me
7490894 i am extremely pleased that our actions which were taken in the best interests of local residents have been vindicated
7490895 the council has got to treat all residents in east lothian exactly the same all the properties near the river tyne at haddington and the properties in musselburgh with a history of flooding including commercial properties
7490896 on most days water quality has been good or of the highest excellent quality but clearly conditions can be affected by pollution from rainfall
7490897 i had this notion that childrens hospices are sad places nothing could be further from the truth
7490898 they are vibrant life affirming retreats they are a wonderfully enriching celebration of every child and young persons potential and of life itself however short it may be
7490899 the aim of chas is to enable families to enjoy their time together and share precious memories the emphasis is on the positive and the here and now
7490900 they provide first class care for the child while at the same time giving mums dads brothers sisters and grandparents the opportunity to relax re charge their batteries and have a break
7490901 its been a bad year but i want to get back out there
7490902 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7490903 we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7490904 black youths within this country have been left to die thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7490905 the building were in just now is a beautiful old farm steading but it is not very flexible or conducive to the needs of a modern office
7490906 the new building is much more flexible and meets the needs of an office environment
7490907 we did search in edinburgh for two or two and a half years but could not quite get what we wanted
7490908 we started looking in an area within ten miles of where we are now but when we could not find exactly what we were looking for we extended the search perimeter
7490909 the site was carefully selected we need to be near a main road network
7490910 the new building will be yards from the motorway and access to edinburgh will be very easy
7490911 our job is to explore the dark recesses of our mind and to come up with the best shows we possibly can
7490912 these guys are playing in shifts it can often be four hours of incessant lone piping so i can see how it could get on peoples nerves
7490913 other pipers can take in over 100 a time which is quite a bit of cash so i dont think paying some money for a licence would be out of the question
7490914 the performers are representing the city and representing the image of the highland soldier and as such they have to be smart and presentable but at the moment anyone is allowed to play
7490915 the bagpiper player in full highland dress is one of scotlands most iconic images
7490916 pipe major iain grant was the perfect role model for our new tv advert given his long association with the railway particularly the east coast route
7490917 he is a well known popular character and represents everything that is traditional yet fun about scotland making it such an interesting destination to visit by train
7490918 i submitted planning permission two weeks ago to turn the house into a bed and breakfast for a temporary period of five years
7490919 for the building to remain empty for any length of time just encourages vandals
7490920 to get it open and get some employment in the area would be a good thing
7490921 it will be aimed at the east lothian tourist trade
7490922 i have never run a b amp b before but i have looked after 70 old people its a completely different type of client but its still looking after people
7490923 im obviously very sorry that the home has closed however the owners have got to find some use for this sorry building and i imagine most of the community will be glad to see it being used for something
7490924 this funding is going to projects that will provide education and support for women seeking a route out of street prostitution
7490925 i am glad we have been able to kick start these initiatives and hope that down the line more support will be made available to continue any successful schemes
7490926 prostitution damages lives and corrodes communities and parliament has rightly acted to tackle the kerb crawlers who fuel this pernicious vice
7490927 projects such as those being funded in edinburgh are key to helping provide routes out of prostitution and to preventing others from becoming involved in the first place
7490928 making good buildings is not difficult if the client has the commitment and determination to do so and has a design team similarly committed i have had the privilege of working with a great team at edi
7490929 ian wall was an inspired client throughout his years with edinburgh city council and edi he showed a great determination to ensure quality developments and commitment to raising the profile of good architecture
7490930 were obviously looking to get the most out of edinburgh being busy just now
7490931 the last two years it has coincided with the tartan week in edinburgh but we thought wed take advantage of the city being full
7490932 it means that we can get bands along in the fine weather and make it just a really special event
7490933 there are two reasons its important for us its an important fundraiser but its also a good spectacle to raise awareness of the rock trust and the work that we do
7490934 we saw it advertised and thought we should do it its a good cause i used to work in the shelter shop so i always try and support the homeless
7490935 its something different something special and i work with children and adults with disabilities and people that cant really manage so ive got an interest in just helping with that its quite different from any other charity walk
7490936 the centre is a great place i am given a huge amount of support and it has all of the equipment i need to learn which has built up my confidence my social life has also improved as i have made new friends
7490937 doors open day offers visitors a great opportunity to see inside some buildings which are not normally accessible to the public
7490938 for the first time in a generation edinburgh is considering building new council houses the plans mark a major change in its housing strategy for tackling the shortage of affordable housing
7490939 under these plans homes built in pennywell north sighthill and gracemount would be a major boost to the regeneration of each area affordable housing would be subsidised by the surplus generated from housing for sale
7490940 i have done what you asked and you should have withdrawn the motion
7490941 you think you are the only person who has the interests of young children at heart
7490942 we should send a letter on behalf of all 58 councillors there is one failure in education in the city and thats you cllr maclaren as convener of education
7490943 foodies was very well attended last year and this year were moving to a larger venue in order to provide more visitors with more fantastic scottish food and drink experiences
7490944 australian jews like all other australians have the right to live without being subjected to this kind of vicious defamation the adc condemns all forms of racism including anti semitism and works for a tolerant society that recognizes the right of people of all religions and backgrounds to live free from discrimination and abuse

7490947 we hung in there and battled and definitely deserved to win
7490948 games like this if that doesnt inspire you and get you going and give you a lift i dont think you like to play
7490949 sometimes you have it from the start and sometimes you have to get a feel for it
7490950 i got a guy or two on base and had to find it quick i tried to work out of a jam and was fortunate to get out of it with limited damage
7490951 we thought breakfast would be cheaper but where we were staying it was 50 for the five of us with two of the kids sharing
7490952 the 13 decline in july new car registrations reflects the continued deterioration in consumer confidence being experienced across the economy

7490962 wat kunt u zeggen over de tegenwoordige wijze van boekhouden
7490963 wat je heel duidelijk ziet is dat het boekhouden door de jaren heen steeds vast is blijven houden aan zijn fundamentele waarde namelijk de balans tussen debet en credit en het is grappig om te zien dat waar oosterse filosofie n al veel langer de werkelijkheid indelen in bijvoorbeeld yin en yang de westerse samenleving deze invalshoek lang buiten beschouwing heeft gelaten totdat ons materialisme onszelf dwong in te zien dat het heel belangrijk is dat debet en credit in evenwicht is dan is het gek om te moeten constateren dat ondanks deze balans er toch onvrede is bijvoorbeeld omdat een klant zijn rekening niet betaalt voor de boekhouding maakt het niets uit of een rekening wel of niet betaald is omdat de balans altijd in evenwicht is de onvrede van de niet betaalde rekening moeten we dan ook buiten de boekhouding zoeken in zogenaamde extra comptabele factoren deze factoren zijn bijvoorbeeld onze zucht naar winst maar deze zucht druist regelrecht in met het fundamentele principe van de boekhouding omdat het disbalans suggereert waar geen disbalans is een ander oosters bijna zen element binnen de boekhouding is de aanwezigheid van debiteuren de klant en crediteuren de leverancier van een dienst of goed echter binnen een zakelijk netwerk kunnen deze twee alleen met elkaar verbonden zijn via de onderneming zelf maar deze derde persoon ontbreekt ten enenmale in de financi le administratie we zijn in onze westerse cultuur kennelijk op de vlucht voor zelfreflectie ik pleit dan ook voor het toevoegen van de egoteur de noodzakelijke derde teur om een holistische doorbraak te bewerkstelligen

7490965 to be honest id like to apologise for it because by the end of the day i was quite embarrassed by it
7490966 i think we most probably deserved something out of the first half
7490967 we had two or three chances hit the post the keeper made a great save from wayne wilson but they just didnt go in again we went out second half let a second goal in and from then on heads went down it was a very poor performance
7490968 its just disappointing because they know theyre better than that
7490969 at the end of the day canvey i thought had more desire more passion than we did and if you dont show that in a football game and i think that comes for free then youre going to struggle
7490970 the contents of the letter will be made known this afternoon
7490971 children are pillars of the nation and if the militants keep doing these evil activities they will ruin the childrens life it will not bring any good to the nation
7490972 i really dont like such kind of atmosphere it affects our studies
7490973 the activities of militants have hampered development its because of them the people of manipur are suffering
7490974 in future i would like to see manipur to be very developed
7490975 we go from house to house to ask mothers to send their children and to use the facilities provided by the centre along with the pre school education and supplementary nutrition we also provide health care facility to the children and mothers free medicines and immunization are also provided the local people and the administration help us to achieve our targets
7490976 in tripura the icds is working for the upliftment of the tribal children and women
7490977 we not only send our children to this centre but come here for medical checkup and food which is given free of cost its a great help for poor people like us
7490978 at this centre our children get pre school education along with training and information about health here pregnant women and nursing mothers are provided free services like supplementary nutrition health check up and immunization to improve the nutritional and health status of children up to six years of age
7490979 we started cultivating crops like brinjal and potato but we did not benefit much after getting information about the hybrid seeds we cultivated that when we used to cultivate brinjal and tomato the crop used to get damaged we have now started sowing chillies which does not get damaged
7490980 here the soil has three layers the upper crust is very sandy the middle crust consists of humus and the third layer has rich cultivable soil we are using all the three layers since the introduction of the hybrid seeds
7490981 i go and train farmers in various villages at block and district level the farmers have even understood that worm compost production is necessary for them so that they can have good production and increase their earnings
7490982 earlier we were facing much hardship since we couldnt afford to buy the chemical fertilizers as they were too costly since the time we have been associated with chetna bharti basanti has taught us how to produce manure using earthworms since then we are rearing earthworms and using these as a catalyst in production of rich compost for our fields many villagers even buy the manure from us at rupees six per kilogram so much so we also sell a quintal or two to chetna bharti this way we make a decent earning for our daily bread as well as educate our kids

7490990 uno de los principales problemas al que deber amos enfrentarnos para comprender la transici n de los soportes que ahora est sucediendo es que no dispon amos todav a de las categor as intelectuales necesarias para percibir los nuevos soportes como libros o dicho de otra manera que nuestras categor as perceptivas est n indisolublemente ligadas a un medio concreto el papel y sus diversas manifestaciones y a la forma en que ese medio compone y transmite los significados

7491019 he made a lot of enemies during his criminal career and there is no shortage of suspects who have to be checked out
7491020 he changed sides in gangs several times as he extended his criminal activities mainly involving himself in armed robberies and more recently in the drugs trade
7491021 he had been active on the crime scene since a young age
7491022 and was well known to gardai around the city particularly in relation to robberies and possession of firearms

7491025 berbiete das die spiele von peking endeten so spektakul r wie sie begonnen haben
7491026 die bergabe hat mehr an die zeiten des swinging london als an die kosmopolitische finanzmetropole die sie heute ist erinnert wenn das ein statement der organisatoren war sich nicht mit der gr te und dem spektakel von peking zu messen sondern stattdessen auf flair und witz zu setzen so ist das empfehlenswert
7491027 wir sollten etwas skurril britisches bieten mit einem langanhaltenden erbe und ohne schrecklichen kater als die spiele von peking zu einem spektakul ren ende kamen gab londons b rgermeister boris johnson einen grellen vorgeschmack auf den individuellen stil der in vier jahren erwartet werden kann die schrullige show stand im kontrast zu der perfekt abgestimmten extravaganz der chinesen in gigantischen dimensionen au ergew hnlichen farb effekten einem bombardement von feuerwerk und atemberaubender artistik
7491028 london kann es nur mit einer kollektiven anstrengung schaffen und einem enthusiasmus den viele wom glich f r unzeitgem oder v llig unbritisch halten
7491029 au er den technischen dingen kann london nur sehr wenig von peking lernen nie wieder wird eine nation das geld und den politischen willen aufbringen um olympische spiele diesen ausma es hervorzubringen
7491030 wir m ssen es auf unsere weise tun der traum von london 2012 ist jetzt realit t geworden und in den n chsten vier jahren wird sich die bohrende aufmerksamkeit der welt nach gro britannien richten wenn wir irgendetwas von peking gelernt haben dann ist es nicht noch einmal zu versuchen was hier in china gemacht wurde f r diese spiele waren die kosten unz hlbar
7491031 wenn es irgendwelche zweifel gab dass die spiele 2012 in london anders sein werden als die in peking sind sie mit dem auftritt von londons b rgermeister boris johnson verschwunden ein frecher schuljunge unter erwachsenen
7491032 die ordnung und der pomp der er ffnungsfeier wurde ersetzt durch leichtigkeit frivolit t und spa die schlussfeier erinnerte an eine gigantische party
7491033 die spiele waren ein zweifelhafter triumph f r china die welt bewunderte die organisation und die finanziellen mittel von den sportst tten bis zu den verschwenderischen zeremonien auf der anderen seite war es bei allem zu viel der organisation
7491034 fast perfekte organisation rekordflut legend re leistungen die ersten olympischen spiele in china waren ein gro er jahrgang der dem asiatischen riesen erlaubt hat seine kraft unter beweis zu stellen der aber auch die grenzen seiner toleranz aufgezeigt hat
7491035 china auf der ganzen linie siegreich die organisation war perfekt die opposition wurde erstickt und der sportliche erfolg hat sich eingestellt
7491036 china ein koloss mit 100 medaillen die schlussfeier hebt die sportlichen erfolge des landes hervor sie ist zwar informeller als die er ffnungszeremonie sie ist aber trotzdem magisch gigantisch und perfekt
7491037 die olympischen spiele sind zu ende und china ist ein bisschen n her ger ckt zumindest hoffen wir es der schlafende gigant asiens ist erwacht und verlangt einen platz in der welt
7491038 die gigantische sensations show die sommerspiele 2008 bertrafen alles was organisation ablauf und pr zision betrifft
7491039 bye bye peking eine farbenfrohe und stimmungsvolle abschlussfeier china hat zum abschluss der olympischen spiele noch einmal sein leistungsverm gen demonstriert
7491040 peking schlie t die spiele mit einem sehr britischem akzent ab jetzt sind die engl nder dran die besten spiele der geschichte zu organisieren
7491041 es kann jetzt f r swiss life nur noch darum gehen gesichtswahrend auszusteigen
7491042 very likely we could see some resistance going forward and see another leg down
7491043 investors are likely to shy away from bank stocks in fear of further real estate and construction firm collapses from mid september so bank shares are likely to remain subdued in the near term
7491044 the start has gone very well for me personally but from a captaincy point of view the players have been absolutely brilliant
7491045 all the guys have created such a good environment you never know how people will take the change on but it has been taken on by everybody in such a positive manner
7491046 i have just tried to drum into them the way i want us to play and they have accepted that in the best possible way
7491047 he will bat at six bowl his medium pace and field at backward point and he has 150 games of one day international experience

7491049 well not get carried away because its only two games
7491050 but it was one of those games where paul ince was on a high after the result last weekend it was his first home game hes just signed roque santa cruz on a new contract so there was a little bit of momentum with blackburn and it was important we got something
7491051 we are a family and we are all really happy today
7491052 it is not true that it was just silvio berlusconi who wanted him here i worked on it to and i am happy that in the end we managed to bring him home
7491053 all the players i know personally from other countries have safety and security concerns
7491054 it was good that this decision was taken out of our players hands
7491055 over the last couple of weeks it has been a huge topic of conversation in the dressing room
7491056 and last sundays briefing was a huge talking point this whole week there has been ifs and buts and dos and donts
7491057 what i said to the team was to put it to the back of our minds because the most important thing for us is the one day series with south africa and that means standing up to be counted on tuesday
7491058 it is not the obligation of the ttc to do province wide economic development
7491059 my mind was focused to the start of the league season with golden arrows but god has decided otherwise and wanted to give me this chance of playing in england
7491060 for me robinho is the same player as always he is an important player who should be part of this project
7491061 i think that he knows that he can be successful at real madrid it is a subject that you need to resolve in the best way possible but we are all selfish and the best would be that he stays with us for a long time
7491062 i love the fans the scottish people and the scottish league i love the club i adore the club
7491063 my wish is to sign another two years at celtic but that will be hard if i dont fit into the coachs plans you never know in life things can change
7491064 if they dont need me its up to them to let me know
7491065 i love the fans the scottish people and the scottish league i love the club i adore the club
7491066 my wish is to sign another two years at celtic but that will be hard if i dont fit into the coachs plans you never know in life things can change
7491067 if they dont need me its up to them to let me know
7491068 dickie wants me to meet a hacker who wants to hack into my computer he just wants to see what he can find
7491069 20 20 that featured confidential state farm documents the rigsbys former employer e
7491070 put in wind file do not pay bill do not discuss
7491071 see we already have these documents were just going to see if they state farm actually give us what is written on them and stuck to them and so forth
7491072 that had a sticky note on it and she said well what do you think of the note and i flipped it over and looked at the underside and i said well i dont know who wrote it they didnt sign it i dont think thats unusual for a sticky note like that to be in the file
7491073 intends to try the case in front of u s district judge l t senter jr instead of in the newspapers
7491074 20 20 episode in august 2006 that very bluntly accused state farm of systematically
7491075 obviously state farm put a great deal of pressure on them to deliberately misrepresent the truth under oath
7491076 kerri kept saying that sandra bullock was going to play her
7491077 were going to make a movie were going to be famous
7491078 i let him in the computer and i cant speak after that
7491079 so he either flew a jet flew his jet out there
7491080 hired some guy to meet him at the airport called bloomington and tipped them off and said that dickie is there to meet somebody and pat lobrano kept going he loves all this and i was going what was in the package they were like oh probably nothing they were laughing about it he loves cloak and dagger you know

7491090 its clear that the confidence in maple leaf and our brand has been shaken and i feel very badly about that
7491091 but i do believe that if we fundamentally do the right thing if we act in the interest of public health over time i hope that we can rebuild that confidence
7491092 we had lunch with him yesterday he went to the markets did a bit of shopping and was in great form hes the team captain first into the ring and last out and hell do the business dont you worry

7491096 did you ever ponder the irony that a coke can be bought just about anywhere on earth but we cannot succeed to save the dying children of our own species with inexpensive medications for diarrhea and other illnesses simon berry did he is campaigning to convince the coca cola company to put its mighty and extensive distribution network to use in delivering life saving medications and information in developing countries maybe by dedicating one compartment in every 10 crates as the life saving compartment coca cola is listening

7491178 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool

7491180 our nation wide policy of abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy was neither voted for by our people nor enacted by our legislators not a single state had such unrestricted abortion before the supreme court decreed it to be national policy in 1973 make no mistake abortion on demand is not a right granted by the constitution

7491185 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7491186 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7491187 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7491188 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7491189 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7491190 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7491191 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7491192 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7491193 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7491194 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7491195 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7491196 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7491197 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7491198 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7491199 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7491200 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7491201 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7491202 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7491218 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7491219 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7491220 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7491221 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7491222 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7491223 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7491224 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7491225 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7491226 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7491227 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7491228 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7491229 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7491230 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7491231 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7491232 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7491233 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7491234 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7491235 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7491236 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7491237 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7491238 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7491239 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7491240 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7491241 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7491242 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7491243 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7491244 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7491245 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7491246 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7491247 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7491248 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7491249 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7491250 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7491251 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis

7491254 der er ikke decideret l jet i sagerne men arbejdet har ikke v ret gjort godt nok vi har et bevillings hierarki og alt efter st rrelsen p engagementet bliver beslutningen truffet det sted i organisationen hvor de skal tr ffes

7491272 zum einen wird bei sportlern die haut an den f en extrem beansprucht das f hrt zu winzigen hautrissen an denen sich die pilzsporen einnisten k nnen zum anderen herrschen innerhalb des getragenen sportschuhs wegen des fu schwei es und der temperaturen ideale berlebensbedingungen f r die pilzerreger
7491273 ich rate dazu m glichst luftdurchl ssige und niemals zu enge sportschuhe zu tragen nach dem duschen sollte man die f e gr ndlich abtrocknen und auch die zehenzwischenr ume nicht vergessen ganz wichtig nie barfuss laufen sondern immer badeschuhe tragen das gilt sowohl im schwimmbad als auch in den gemeinschaftsduschen
7491274 heilung braucht zeit ich halte nichts von einer kurztherapie ber eine woche zwar sind die symptome bereits nach wenigen tagen bereits abgeklungen aber die haut braucht zeit sich zu regenerieren und ihre nat rliche schutzbarriere gegen die erreger neu aufzubauen hat sie diese zeit nicht kann es sehr schnell zu einer erneuten infektion kommen

7491296 barack obama and his wife michelle walked into historys arms last
7491297 you obviously are paid to be an objective journalist but some part of you must be excited that barack obama won this nomination
7491298 well certainly i mean as an african american man this is significant i mean look for my entire life ive been able to as a man dream of doing great things but a dream i could never have was being president of the united states now for instance my sons my nephew they can have that dream and i think those kinds of images are important
7491299 im curious about your feelings last night it was an historic moment has it sunk in yet when everybody clears out the staff is gone youre in the hotel room at night and youre alone do you say to yourself son of a gun ive done this
7491300 and this is still on the table the dream ticket i mean and i think one of the things theyre going to be talking about today is how hard does she hillary clinton push with her 17 million votes for that place on the ticket i think its the best ticket for the democrats i think if barack obama picks her they have the best chance of winning
7491301 former white house press secretary scott mcclellan talks about the failure of mainstream media to hold the bush administrations feet to the fire in the run up to the war is that an allegation that feels to you like it has merit or not
7491302 i think its one of the most embarrassing chapters in american journalism and i think there was a sense of pressure from corporations who own where we work and from the government itself to really squash any kinds of dissent or any kind of questioning of it i think it was extremely subtle but very very effective and i think scott mcclellan has a really good point
7491303 mcclellan claims that president bush used propaganda to sell the war lets look at what he says in the book and his advisers confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war he finally articulates what we all came to believe
7491304 in the book you say the bush administration made a decision to turn away from candor and honesty and you point to the war in iraq as the prime example you seem to stop just short of saying that president bush and his administration flat out lied however you word it isnt it lying scott isnt that what they were doing
7491305 do you feel any sense of guilt that the iraq war which you helped sell to the american people has resulted in the loss of life for thousands of american soldiers
7491306 i will directly address myths that have been associated with him some deliberately perpetuated by activist liberals and some created by the media i will look at what is behind the media hostility toward the president and his administration and how much of it is rooted in a liberal bias
7491307 despite his record mr mccain has been obliged to deal with the burden that falls on any republican candidate to deal with the partys conservative wing which demands commitment to its goal of tilting the courts rightward mr mccain has chosen to do everything in his power to demonstrate his fealty to their cause like mr mccain neither mr reagan nor mr bush was a lawyer and adopting the same rhetoric as mr mccain is now using they became enthusiastic instruments of those conservative lawyers who were diligent in choosing conservative judicial nominees
7491308 mr obama on the other hand is a lawyer and has had a long and

7491310 desperate times call for desperate measures some people are doing anything they can to save on gas while others are trying to avoid buying gas altogether then theres jessica busby using her bike to get to a blood donation center two times a week she pumps out her own blood making 40 a pop so she has enough money to pump gas
7491311 something is happening right now that demands attention people struggling to pay for the basic necessities food gas housing seeing savings depleted plans for kids and future threatened now thats a heavy burden and over time that pressure can cause your body to start breaking down the seminal example is the great depression when the suicide rate jumped 14 to 17 for every 100 000 americans and today with the threat of recession looming large the price we pay physically may skyrocket as well

7491315 if mccain gets in its going to be very very dangerous its a critical time but i have faith in the american people if they prove me wrong ill be checking out a move to italy maybe canada i dont know were at an abyss
7491316 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7491317 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7491318 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7491319 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7491320 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7491321 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7491322 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7491323 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7491324 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7491325 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7491326 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7491327 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7491328 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7491329 who are open to doing something on the production side
7491330 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7491331 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7491332 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7491333 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7491334 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7491335 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7491336 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7491337 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

7491346 they just talk about it and dont say its wrong
7491347 ive known people who have done all of that in the song
7491348 really its for all of them the point is if you dont stop soon youre really going to hurt yourself or kill yourself and thats not right
7491349 a lot of these issues need to be talked about in a way people want to listen to
7491350 i dont want to listen to some really boring person lecture me for an hour and a half about teen suicide domestic violence and all that stuff
7491351 i wasnt the only one that other people could relate

7491357 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like

7491413 und jetzt sagen wir wir machen es f r uns wir brauchen die bundesrepublik nicht
7491414 en espa a se habla de todo menos del rey
7491415 hay que tener en cuenta que del total de muertes evitables en menores de cinco a os un 13 se podr a prevenir si la madre le diera el pecho en forma exclusiva hasta los seis meses y junto con otros alimentos hasta los dos a os de edad
7491416 est probado que los chicos amamantados tienen la mitad de episodios de enfermedades que aquellos que tomaron teta de hecho los menores de cuatro meses que tomaron leche materna y no otra cosa tienen cuatro veces menos riesgo de sufrir menigitis por haemophilus influenzae
7491417 podr a aumentar la interacci n verbal entre madre e hijo lo que mejorar a el desarrollo cognitivo de los ni os
7491418 lo ideal ser a contar con siete meses pagos para no perder todos los beneficios que implica amamantar tanto para la madre como para el beb
7491419 respetando el derecho de amamantar y los tiempos indispensables para sacarse leche aun en horarios laborales
7491420 el beb de una mujer que est nerviosa no podr tomar teta como se merece porque la oxitocina que es la hormona que permite que la leche salga del cuerpo se inhibe ante la presencia de adrenalina vale decir el estr s retiene la leche con los consiguientes efectos negativos para el beb y para la madre que suele sufrir de n dulos y mastitis porque si bien produce leche el ni o no la puede extraer
7491421 si luego la madre con vih le da el pecho es m s probable que el virus entre en contacto con la sangre del beb y se contagie
7491422 de este modo protegemos a la mam en el pre y post parto y tambi n al ni o reci n nacido que teniendo a su madre disponible todas las noches en el primer a o de vida puede ser amamantado con todos los beneficios que esto implica
7491423 a partir del s ptimo mes y hasta que el menor cumpla el a o puedan desempe ar seis horas corridas diarias
7491424 este fue un reclamo muy ansiado por las profesionales de la salud nos lo han pedido en la mesa paritaria sectorial y enseguida nos pusimos a trabajar en la resoluci n para hacerlo efectivo porque consideramos que es una iniciativa necesaria para cuidar tanto a la trabajadora como al beb por nacer
7491425 existe un estado asambleario que ir determinando las acciones a seguir en reclamo de respuestas concretas del gobierno para el sector
7491426 este lunes desde las 10 se reunir la mesa de enlace provincial para organizar los detalles de una gran asamblea que se realizar el 30 de agosto en el t nel subfluvial
7491427 existe un estado asambleario que ir determinando las acciones a seguir
7491428 de los vecinos visitados un 10 solicit un plan de facilidades de pago en el instante mismo de la notificaci n
7491429 de ellos depende la decisi n de proyectar el futuro a trav s del presupuesto entendemos que no sirven las palabras que la nica realidad de lo que se proyecta realizar la dir el presupuesto educativo el cual hasta el momento garantiza la situaci n de emergencia de nuestro sistema educativo
7491430 habr que adecuar el presupuesto actual para solucionar el conflicto y habr que planificar un presupuesto educativo futuro que garantice el derecho a la educaci n en entre r os la constituci n establece que el presupuesto educativo debe ser del 25 por ciento establecido en momentos que solo era obligatoria la educaci n primaria hoy deberemos resolver el porcentaje del presupuesto que se destinar a educaci n y fundamentalmente se tendr que cumplir
7491431 el presupuesto actual contiene pobreza en material did ctico insuficiencia en mantenimiento de muebles e inmuebles carencia de higiene y seguridad salario de los trabajadores en negro y sin garantizar subsistencia etc el presupuesto educativo deber cambiar para poder garantizar el derecho a la educaci n
7491432 los legisladores nos deber n informar sobre las medidas de control que garanticen la transparencia del gasto en infraestructura edilicia y nosotros les mostraremos algunos casos donde se presentan irregularidades que se deben investigar
7491433 los legisladores nacionales nos deber n informar respecto a la modificaci n del rol del estado nacional y su compromiso con la escuela p blica hoy a cargo de las provincias
7491434 tambi n nos tendr n que informar los legisladores provinciales y nacionales sobre las modificaciones al sistema econ mico que garanticen la distribuci n de la riqueza y en ese sentido les pedimos la misma disposici n que tuvieron en el conflicto agrario ahora para solucionar un conflicto que involucra a la mayor a de la poblaci n trabajadora
7491435 entre el martes o mi rcoles estaremos reunidos nuevamente con el gobernador en paran
7491436 se habl de la ley de arrendamiento de los cierres de los tambos y del impuesto inmobiliario cosa que preocupa al productor ya que es una cuesti n inoportuna
7491437 en la provincia estamos de paro y el gobierno hizo ofertas y contraofertas que no llegaron a conformar a los docentes y por esa raz n las asambleas de uda decidieron continuar el paro esta semana los d as 27 8 y 29 de agosto
7491438 por el inmediato pago de la deuda del fondo de incentivo docente fonid y la continuidad del mismo ya que vence en diciembre de este a o y vamos a quedar a la deriva y los salarios que ya son magros quedar n peor
7491439 otro tema que preocupa y por el cual estamos reclamando es la movilidad del 82 por ciento para las jubilaciones docentes porque en algunas provincias hay aumentos para los activos pero los pasivos no lo ven reflejado
7491440 ahora se est a la espera de la respuesta porque tienen que analizarlo con un programa de computaci n para ver si es viable con el presupuesto
7491441 hay que tener paciencia y esperar pero es posible que se acepte nuestra propuesta
7491442 se analiz la problem tica de la salud en general en funci n del presupuesto ya que se necesita un presupuesto acorde con la necesidad de salud de la provincia que hoy est bastante deteriorada
7491443 los funcionarios informaron que pueden hacer una ampliaci n presupuestario pero el problema es conseguir los recursos y de alguna forma se contemplaron todas las problem ticas que se vienen ahora en especial desde que se dar rango constitucional al derecho a la salud de los entrerrianos porque nosotros pedimos que no quede en una escritura en el papel sino que efectivamente se lleve a la pr ctica
7491444 se analizaron las org nicas hospitalarias ya que es necesario aumentar algunos presupuestos cargos que cubrir y pagar algunas diferencias de salarios
7491445 hicieron una propuesta de 170 pesos sobre un c digo a crear que el primer mes ser a no bonificable y no remunerativo en el segundo mes ser a s lo el 50 por ciento y as se ampliar a sucesivamente hasta llegar a fin de a o
7491446 nosotros rechazamos de plano la incorporaci n de un nuevo c digo y presentamos una contrapropuesta partiendo del presupuesto que ellos ten an lo que sorprendi a los funcionarios porque nuestra postura es que cualquier aumento de salario que se considere hoy tiene que pasar al b sico y a partir de ah se discutir el incremento
7491447 se est a la espera de la respuesta de la gente de econom a porque tienen que analizarlo con un programa de computaci n para ver si es viable con el presupuesto
7491448 hay que tener paciencia y esperar pero es posible que se acepte nuestra propuesta
7491449 i could go on about the weight i lost all day but honestly getting people in the army i love that
7491450 i wanted them to succeed i told them youve got a guaranteed job guaranteed paycheck guaranteed education if you want it guaranteed benefits everything
7491451 theyre all proud they did it they have no regrets
7491452 he was scared that he would be picked on during basic combat training that he would be called names
7491453 they saw that i had money i had a nice car and that i was always going places with my wife and my kid
7491454 in basic training they pretty much starved me for breakfast i had two boiled eggs sausage patty for lunch and dinner i had a tuna fish or a ham and turkey sandwich i did physical training every chance i got i got smoked for nothing
7491455 i just got real lazy and gained all my weight back
7491456 i couldnt pass my pt test i couldnt pass my tape test
7491457 i just couldnt take it no more i was tired of being big i had to make a lot of sacrifices go to the gym do pt three times a day
7491458 working with the ias can be hard because very few of them speak english
7491459 even when talking to americans now we find ourselves talking with gestures
7491460 everything we do they want to do a big part of our job is training but they came to us very well trained in vehicle and personnel searches
7491461 each day they impress us with something when we try to teach them and it turns out they already know the task
7491462 a lot of them have quite a bit of combat experience
7491463 well have been out here for two weeks on saturday
7491464 its all about teamwork working hand in hand a partnership to learn each others medical culture and to better facilitate and train the iraqis
7491465 the focus for this particular clinic was sharing with the doctors the advancements in medicine that they didnt have access to over the last several years
7491466 we look at the building the infrastructure development equipment supplies and mentoring with the iraqi doctors to improve their experience and capabilities
7491467 its a great way for people to relieve stress and get a workout at the same time
7491468 its something i really enjoy a lot so now i teach it six days a week
7491469 in american style kickboxing you are only allowed to use your fists and feet to kick above the hip
7491470 kickboxing is good for cardiovascular fitness but a lot of people also gain self confidence from the classes because they are doing a lot of things most people dont get to do said sgt
7491471 they come into the class and as time goes on you see them progress and you can tell by their reactions when theyre around other people their attitude has completely changed they have that self esteem built up from something theyve never done
7491472 it is incredibly rewarding to be able to have had such noticeable positive impact
7491473 melanie was an excellent chemistry student in my group with a passion for public service
7491474 we kick off in london so its like its a two parter so to speak and find bones and booth in london
7491475 we shot at the guild which is an old kind of church where they tried people i mean back in the 15th century an old pub henry viiis shooting grounds his old pub i mean the thames big ben in the background obviously were doing the double decker bus thing were doing the mini were doing the city of london with the turnaround i cant get right stuck in the turnaround you know all those things i think whats beautiful about shooting here is that you really have put these two characters in just a historical place everywhere you look theres just something amazing to look at or very old so its great
7491476 wexler obviously is the forensics guy over here and hes you know moving in on her which you know thats fine but at the same time its going to drive me a bit crazy obviously
7491477 you are going to have to watch the show because booth does a lot of he attempts an accent which makes it even better that im not even going to tell you what happens but its happening in this scene its really good
7491478 booth and bones are already in bed so to speak metaphorically speaking theyre like an old couple theyre like you know hepburn and tracy kind of romance old film i like to look at them as the bickering couple that continues to grow with each other
7491479 in this show particularly its the type of episode that you really see these two work together abroad and its just different its different for booth its different for her s and that just creates just some really funny moments whether its with the royalty or whether its with the common people or whether its just with the way that scotland yard operates and the fbi operates its just its great to be a part of you know this type of an episode
7491480 they are very respectful fans i mean i think that theyre they come right up and be very close to you while youre doing a close up and you dont even hear or see them so its just a different type of atmosphere and a different feeling so its more of i guess more of a respect level here than they would if you were shooting in different other places
7491481 coffee they really dont have much good coffee here i mean it was good cup of coffee good cheeseburger really good cheeseburger nice steak on the grill you know american stuff cant really beat
7491482 well its very different to shoot in london you know i mean the crew is different the way they break up the divisions of every department is different ive been enjoying it just because of the scenery is just you know a lot more impressive than what we have in los angeles just any corner you go to is pretty interesting architecturally and historically in london so thats been a treat
7491483 i think the most challenging thing weve shot was the tower bridge we had to do a shot we had one minute to get a shot and no other chance to to get the shot we needed the tower bridge opening in the background and we knew it opened at a specific time i think it was 10 00 p m and i think we got it
7491484 depict ing and expos ing both literally and figuratively the extreme misery pathos and dehumanisation of poverty
7491485 sasol has not in the past nor plans in the future to offer any form of censure or controls within the new signatures judging process but we do believe we have a right to express a view on any decision by the judges both to the judges and to the public
7491486 we will naturally accept the decision of the judges we also recognise that some members of the sasol staff as well as some members of the public may be challenged or even offended by the piece and we feel it is both responsible and appropriate that we distance sasol from the artwork
7491487 however if companies want to sponsor such competitions they need to accept all art and not just beautiful indoor art
7491488 kingship is hereditary but for mumbere whom did he succeed
7491489 fighting cannot be used to determine the fate of someone becoming a cultural leader these people should know that culture is an agreement between god and the rwenzori people
7491490 they dont belong to the rwenzori region because their origin is in congo their help during the struggle for independence cannot be repaid with the kingdoms top position
7491491 selon les rapports elle sest approch e des policiers irakiens en disant quelle portait cette ceinture dexplosifs et quelle ne voulait pas sen servir
7491492 a d clar lundi un porte parole militaire am ricain
7491493 reste d terminer si elle a t forc e de se charger dexplosifs ou si elle la fait volontairement
7491494 la reddition de cette kamikaze montre que les irakiens continuent de rejeter
7491495 forgive your enemies always thats the thing trouble him the most
7491496 we believe the visit will be a turning point in the two countries relationship which has been primarily an economic one to expand into all areas including politics defence and culture
7491497 its true in london and in the big cities of the north it is connected to the new poverty
7491498 england is one of the richest countries in the world the people im talking about have enormous televisions a lot bigger than my own the latest in mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend
7491499 european electorates are aging must faster than americas making europeans more risk averse
7491500 some of the most despicable in politics today its why i love to call them the club for greed because they wont tell you who gave their money
7491501 a guy with a thin skin a nasty vindictive streak
7491502 people who have been there all their careers dont begin to have the freedom of movement and the capacity to change washington theyve got lobbyists at every elbow the deals have been worked out in the senate cloakrooms are just so overwhelming the scores that have to be settled all of the favors that have to honored you just cant get the job done in washington with people that have been in washington all their lives so people are saying you know what we need change
7491503 the damascus highway links hezbollah strongholds in the central and northern bekaa valley with beiruts southern suburbs while the coastal highway between beirut and sidon connects hezbollah bases in the south with beiruts southern suburbs
7491504 is probably the worlds most effective terrorist organization and that includes al qaeda
7491505 hezbollah has said it would take action if the lebanese parliament elects a new free president
7491506 the group would seize ministries cut off main highways and paralyze the country the question would be what would the lebanese army do and what would the international community do hezbollah has thousands of missiles and rockets but would it really use them in a domestic conflict it also has suicide bombers but would it use them against neighbors and joint economic interests
7491507 the resistance hezbollah was formed before the unification of the army they were here first they fight israel and if any group fights israel we should respect it
7491508 support of the rights and the power of the people
7491509 direct democratic elections in no case later than 31 january 2005
7491510 the moslem media is less and less willing to be an apologist for al qaida at least when it comes to killing moslem civilians
7491511 dead iraqis were killing al qaida westerners unless they observe arab media closely and have contacts inside the arab world will not have noted this sharp drop in fortunes
7491512 the governmental political participation and structure building information intel media and political perception and economic economic development infrastructure creation lines of operation
7491513 caffeine and alcohol is a dangerous mix whether it is red bull and vodka or the new sparks red drink by millercoors
7491514 the caffeine makes drinkers think they are not impaired but they are actually supercharged drunks who think they are bulletproof
7491515 youth who combine caffeine and alcohol are more likely to drive fight and have unsafe sex this is a new threat to our young people so i urge parents to learn more about the dangers these drinks pose to children and talk to their kids about those dangers
7491516 it is amazing to me that in spite of being under investigation by the attorneys general millercoors intends to introduce sparks red with an even higher alcohol content in october consequently today i have sent a letter to leo kiely the chief executive officer of millercoors asking for copies of documents regarding the marketing strategy for sparks red i just wish the company would respond more responsibly as did anheuser busch i guess millercoors lust for the corporate annual profits of 114 million off of the caffeinated drinks overrides their concern for our young people
7491517 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7491518 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7491519 s una reuni n formal donde queremos continuar el di logo
7491520 nuestra idea es reconstruir un espacio en donde podamos pensar juntos el futuro con necesidades de los docentes y posibilidades de la provincia con buena voluntad de todos
7491521 intensamente con el ministro de gobierno y el ministro de econom a porque el gobernador y todo su gabinete queremos llegar con la mejor propuesta a la reuni n
7491522 es responsabilidad de todos llegar a un acuerdo porque no podemos estar en una pulseada forzando mientras los chicos no tienen clases
7491523 no es cuesti n de ganarles a los gremios o que los gremios le ganen al gobierno sino que haya clases
7491524 los conflictos no se pueden extender infinitamente todos tenemos que estar pensando en el bien com n y no en una puja entre gobierno y sindicatos ambos tenemos la obligaci n de ser responsables y de llegar a un acuerdo
7491525 we have a significant amount of working going on and we hope to have more work in the future
7491526 we are very pleased to offer numerous types of classes for our employees to improve their job skills and job search skills while helping them find new employment
7491527 helping all of our employees find new employers is our main priority and focus in northern indiana
7491528 our hope is that the vast majority of our employees will be able to find employment through the contacts that they make at one of our job fairs or through the ongoing support that we will be providing at our job and resource centers
7491529 when it sought to transfer the question of security arrangements from the african union as stipulated in the abuja agreement to the international community
7491530 the international community has so far failed to organize any meetings between the government and the darfur rebel movements despite the continued declarations by the government that it was ready for talks anywhere any time
7491531 u s out of iraq now money for human needs not for war say no to the republican agenda demand peace justice and equality
7491532 whether you are building the labor movement in peoria ill building solidarity with palestine or are speaking out against the many injustices that face people at home and abroad
7491533 no to war against oppressed peoples no to war against the immigrant community no to state terrorism against latin america
7491534 nationally known speakers will participate in panels and discussions relating to their fields of expertise
7491535 all ideologies welcome intended to create a positive and welcoming space to organize for progressive change a nonpartisan event featuring anti flag wookie foot the sustainable living roadshow and more free and open to all
7491536 march to the xcel center where people will utilize a diversity of tactics to confront the rnc creatively and directly
7491537 american liberalism is a totalitarian political religion but not necessarily an orwellian one it is nice not brutal nannying not bullying but it is definitely totalitarian or holistic if you prefer and that liberalism today sees no realm of human life that is beyond political significance from what you eat to what you smoke to what you say sex is political food is political sports entertainment your inner motives and your outer appearances all have political salience for liberal fascists
7491538 what hitler got from italian fascism was the importance of an idea that would arouse the masses
7491539 for decades the left has cherry picked the facts to form a caricature of what the third reich was about the very large and substantial leftist and socialist aspects of nazism were shrunk to the status of trivia the obsession of cranks and hitler apologists the nazis
7491540 rose to power exploiting anti capitalist rhetoric they indisputably believed and for these reasons hitler deserves to be placed firmly on the left because first and foremost he was a revolutionary broadly speaking the left is the party of change the right is the party of the status quo on this score hitler was in so sense way shape or form a man of the right
7491541 if we could only rekindle the hope and ambition of those early radicals what might have been will turn into what still could be
7491542 unions will grow by 1 5 million members a year not just for five years but for 10 to 15 straight years
7491543 give a man a fish and hell eat for a day teach a man to fish and hell eat for a lifetime
7491544 23 sales tax on all final consumption expenditures on new purchases
7491545 good news less news on iraq war mrc study as surge succeeds and casualty rates fall abc cbs and nbc lose interest in iraq war
7491546 insurgent attacks are down from 170 in january to 120 in august
7491547 but that is still four attacks a day on average iraq remains a very violent place life in central iraq is still deadly dangerous
7491548 this is really an exception that civil war as again as you get out of the capital of baghdad it is truly brewing so this is really just a partial success for this surge so far
7491549 not only is there a huge increase in iraqi citizens groups who are coming forward to help the americans but overall levels of violence have gone way down
7491550 you took a lot of doubting and rather skeptical questions about the surge ill give you a chance to crow do you want to say i told you so
7491551 much worse than the picture the image we even have of iraq
7491552 the hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax
7491553 the truth is he did implement two modest tax cuts which the club for growth gives him credit for
7491554 but the majority of his tax cuts were little tweaks and changes to the tax code like exempting purchases of the arkansas symphony orchestra tickets from the sales tax that doesnt really count as a massive tax cut
7491555 others have suggested a hybrid that would collect some monies from any one or a combination of those various ideas and if thats the plan that the house and senate agree upon then you will have nothing but my profound thanks
7491556 if you play that whole speech what you would see is that the context was we were days away from a budget showdown that would have closed the government in arkansas
7491557 and the context of the speech was you want a surcharge you want a sales tax okay but weve got to have a budget people
7491558 weve got to come up with a way to keep state government working
7491559 the club for growth thinks that an executives first resort should be cutting spending not lets raise any tax we can think of that clip is emblematic of mike huckabees entire 10 year tenure in which his first resort was raise taxes
7491560 lots of states go through tough times but its especially during those tough times when governors need to cut spending cut government waste and mike huckabee was more inclined to raise taxes than he was to cut the size of government
7491561 the club for growth welcomes what people call converts the more the merrier
7491562 the problem is that mike huckabee while even though he signed the no tax pledge and he talks about the fair tax isnt really demonstrating that hes changed
7491563 he embraces and defends all of his tax hikes and he continues to promote besides the issue of taxes large big government programs
7491564 has a troubled history of tolerating tax increases and spending increases in the past but we are very much in favor of people learning from the past and moving forward
7491565 on the other hand i dont think one should raise taxes
7491566 it would have been better to have said heres a list of assets the state can sell heres a list of things we could do and if the democrats want to shut down the government because we wont raise taxes have that fight
7491567 we did raise taxes and we did raise spending and i wish we hadnt and in the future we wont
7491568 huckabee did not make that commitment when he was running for governor and so he didnt break it
7491569 so looking forward the governor has said and committed that he will veto and vote against any tax increase and thats very important
7491570 if romney can make the case that he has become pro life and that thats a credible shift then hes stronger
7491571 if huckabee can make the case that his days of tax and spending increases are behind him then hell be a strong candidate
7491572 it is great news when the price of energy food transportation health care and consumer electronics drops but for some reason it is bad news when the price of shelter drops shouldnt we be seeing stories filled with anecdotes about formerly priced out middle income families finally getting their chance at the american dream
7491573 for every house sold because the buyer couldnt make the payments
7491574 there is a buyer on the other end of that transaction who got a good deal and for every foreclosure there are probably 10 buyers of nearby homes who benefited from the general easing of house price pressure
7491575 ia tidak ada mana mana rujukan hanya berdasarkan pendapat peribadi dan ini salah besar bercakap hal hukum berasaskan fikiran sendiri adalah kesalahan yang besar dalam islam
7491576 hukum ini bersumpah adalah hukum allah yang terdapat dalam al quran dan as sunah dan dihurai serta ditafsir dalam pelbagai kitab
7491577 a couple of other robert forrest statues have gone up for sale over the years but this is the most significant by some way its very dynamic and very robustly carved its a really impressive carving and it has big commercial appeal
7491578 i think a better place could be found for it than its existing location
7491579 for example possibly a financial institution could buy it there are obviously lots of developments in the fountainbridge area of the city and that might be a solution or perhaps a private buyer who would be prepared to offer access where the public can go along on certain days of the year to view it
7491580 at the time it was released in the us there were a few screenings where it had subtitles
7491581 i thought that was a bit unfair i last saw the film 15 years ago and i still think its a great movie
7491582 it was shot in black and white so you can have half your money back
7491583 i took the part really to do something different from bond and it was a very complicated film
7491584 the only reservation i had was whether an american director would be able to handle the disciplines of the british in the army i was delighted to find that sidney lumet the director could and i have made five films with him which is the longest relationship ive ever had with a director
7491585 taking orders from someone you genuinely feel is an idiot is very difficult
7491586 we are getting so many mixed messages from iraq and afghanistan and it seems to be the exact same situation as when britain fought there in the 1800s
7491587 we have recently met up with director of education gillian tee and education leader marilyne maclaren and both meetings have been successful
7491588 im excited about our plans and want to put people in tune with what we are thinking and hopefully they will join in im still very confident that we will not close
7491589 i will be going along to the meetings but everyone is expecting the school to close
7491590 this means many of our pupils are being taught in buildings which are expensive to run as they are too big for the number of pupils
7491591 it is important that we use our resources wisely to allow us to give all pupils a quality education in schools fit for the 21st century
7491592 no decisions have been made and we are now consulting with parents and stakeholders to listen to their views on the proposals
7491593 potentially significant implications for schools and services to vulnerable children
7491594 edinburgh has unique problems it has a drug culture deeply embedded in society and there are currently around 6000 drug addicts registered in the city
7491595 social workers and health visitors report a growing number of parents involved in some form of substance misuse and this partly accounts for the dramatic increase in child protection referrals over the last four years
7491596 this february when we were setting the budget the councils administration told us that everything was now under control
7491597 three months into the financial year we find out this is not the case
7491598 it is deeply worrying that they have this projected overspend
7491599 vulnerable children requiring care is not a new issue and the department has to get better at predicting what levels are going to be required to meet these pressures
7491600 the department still faces enormous budget pressures in many areas the largest of these is due to the increasing demand for frontline services particularly those related to vulnerable children
7491601 it is crucial that we find more local foster carers to deal with this increase in demand the only alternative is to place children with other authorities or the independent sector which is very costly
7491602 the area around salamander street has in the recent past been the subject of a great deal of debate on the issue of prostitution
7491603 surely there is an opportunity here for the city to revisit this issue with consideration given to the creation of a tolerance zone this would demonstrate an enlightened approach and would address important issues before they inevitably arise
7491604 i think that as an act of generosity the director of the cockburn association moira tasker should propose a tolerance zone outside her own house
7491605 the people of leith are sick and tired of people belonging to organisations like this who invariably live in places like stockbridge and morningside proposing once again that we dump all the social problems on leithers
7491606 we have almost eradicated this problem it seems this organisation hasnt looked at the history and the battle the community has fought to liberate the streets for local women they should stick to what they do best and not engage in matters they know nothing whatsoever about
7491607 this is the law and we have to work within it whatever its limitations most laws could always do with some fine tuning to improve upon them
7491608 from a legal and enforcement perspective a tolerance zone is not possible theres also a community safety partnership approach we have adopted to encourage routes out of prostitution
7491609 we felt these posters were the ideal way to advertise the exhibit as they give people an idea of what they can expect at the dungeon and we wouldnt want anyone who was maybe a bit squeamish to be shocked or upset when they visited the dungeon
7491610 we can appreciate that some people may have found the images too strong however and when we were contacted by the asa it said we should either edit the posters or take them down
7491611 we decided to alter them and hopefully this is an acceptable compromise although it is a bit of a shame for william wallace as he has lost his limbs again
7491612 the general nature of the complaints was that some people had found the posters to be disturbing offensive and unsuitable particularly when they had been put up in an area where they would be seen by the general public

7491615 my work specially the illustrations are inspired by the dreams that i have and also by a good music that i hear or some interesting book that i read normally i draw listening to music i think this way i can have a more satisfactory result in my work
7491616 i like to hear everything to always discover different rhythms it helps me to create my illustrations currently im hearing ternipe mika asian dub foundation and james brown but i also like very much na o zumbi
7491617 i view the wind proposal in almost a neutral fashion
7491618 we should not be doing things driven by popular very superficial thinking
7491619 does not satisfy the public interest requirement of public service law
7491620 in the end the benefits have to outweigh the risks
7491621 this is a new discussion they havent heard in a long long time
7491622 the coventry plant basically was our long term replacement for vermont yankee and then some
7491623 development of renewable technologies such as solar wind and wood could contribute to the states energy goals with fewer environmental costs but would be more expensive to develop
7491624 when we first started cow power people were rolling their eyes at us
7491625 our goal at cv is to maintain to the greatest extent possible those two advantages
7491626 theres a strong desire in vermont to have more of our power produced in the state
7491627 the kinds of projects we are talking about here are not going to dominate our portfolio
7491628 i have written to the planners expressing my opposition on those grounds if carlisle is to expand that is the logical place for such development to take place a windfarm would detract from that
7491629 if you fly above the m6 motorway then it becomes obvious how little development there is to the east of it around carlisle the area close to junction 42 is an obvious place for industry to want to locate and that is important for the future prosperity of the city
7491630 concerned about someone googling someones name and being able to access it later
7491631 i think parents students and citizens across this land should find out if their local college president belongs to this
7491632 our philosophy has to be not how many protectionist measures can we put in place but how do we invent new things to sell
7491633 thats the view of the future what protectionists are trying to do is lock in the inadequacies of the past
7491634 if somebody in the presidency doesnt begin to understand that we cant have free trade if its not fair trade were going to continually see people who have worked for 20 and 30 years for companies one day walk in and get the pink slip and told im sorry but everything you spent your life working for is no longer here
7491635 correct ricardian theory does imply that worldwide real income per capita does gain so that winners winnings will suffice worldwide to more than compensate losers losings
7491636 huckabee says he would like to eliminate the internal revenue service and replace the income tax with the so called fair tax which would impose a national sales tax on virtually everything we buy but such a tax would be a disaster for this country especially for low and middle income americans who spend a disproportionate portion of their earnings in many cases all of it on the necessities of life
7491637 i think there are several tax deductions that are vital to our economy this would not be a good time i dont know if there would ever be a good time to do this to advocate ending the home mortgage deduction the home mortgage deduction is considered by many critical to the ability of people to buy a home and keep their home
7491638 again let me state what ive said privately as well as publicly but i want to get it on the record again
7491639 some have suggested the retail level of tobacco if that ends up being your preference i will accept that others have suggested a surcharge on the income tax thats acceptable im fine with that others have suggested perhaps a sales tax thats fine
7491640 yet others have suggested a hybrid that will collect some monies from any one or a combination of those various ideas and if thats the plan that the house and senate agree upon then you will have nothing but my profound thanks
7491641 irans refusal to conform to iaea demands to halt enrichment justifies a new u n resolution reinforcing sanctions
7491642 there are three key elements to a nuclear weapon the fissile material the missile itself and the process of weaponizing the fissile material
7491643 iran has put work on the last of these elements on hold
7491644 if so good but iran is still pursuing the other two elements in particular an enrichment program
7491645 doesnt do anything to change my opinion about the danger iran poses to the world
7491646 as long as they continue with their enrichment activities then the opportunity to resume that nuclear weapons program is always present
7491647 this nie takes the nuclear weapons program label off iranian activities but uranium enrichment and plutonium production pose potential threats no matter how they are labeled
7491648 critics of the bush administration might celebrate the nies findings but this would be shortsighted
7491649 leverage is still needed to persuade iran to take measures necessary to reassure its neighbors and the world that it is not gaming the inadequate nuclear rules in ways that could enable it to change its mind break the rules and very quickly build nuclear weapons
7491650 irans progress towards nuclear weapon capability will continue as long as its enrichment work does
7491651 if one reads the full nie text available there are clearly still serious concerns about enrichment activities and an absence of good intelligence on irans strategic intentions
7491652 the nuclear story is not over and the policy challenge of convincing iran to be a responsible player that openly accepts global governance mechanisms remains as acute as ever
7491653 irans leaders are still pushing ahead with their uranium enrichment and heavy water reactor projects
7491654 we are not going to allow iran to become a nuclear power because the regime not just particular individuals but the regime has been too irresponsible for that to happen the worst nightmare of the cold war was that nuclear weapons would be in the hands of irresponsible individuals they qualify as irresponsible both as individuals and as a regime
7491655 only if i felt we were in a position of sufficient strength that we had the leverage i would not do it the way the democrats are suggesting we do it which is without preconditions its very naive to think you can have negotiations with people who are dictators tyrants and supporters of terrorism without preconditions
7491656 moderate and sensible as opposed to regulating businesses out of your state or country
7491657 forty two percent of civilian federal workers are going to retire in the next 8 to 10 years
7491658 my view of a strict constructionist or originalist judge who sticks with the plain meaning of the constitution comes from my judicial philosophy its not that i want one particular decision changed
7491659 the electoral map is roughly the same for hillary clinton and barack obama
7491660 i dont know how the rose law firm records got into my bedroom i dont know how those fbi files ended up in the white house i dont know who hired the guy i hired
7491661 serbia will not let an inch of its territory be taken away

7491663 there could be a new crisis in the balkans by christmas
7491664 we do not work in the service of a party or an industry or even a country
7491665 whatever you think of its policies the current administration has been more secretive more mistrustful of an inquisitive press than any since the nixon administration it has treated freedom of information requests with contempt asserted sweeping claims of executive privilege even reclassified material that had been declassified the administration has subsidized propaganda at home and abroad refined the art of spin discouraged dissent and sought to limit traditional congressional oversight and court review the war in iraq alone is a case study of the administrations determination to dominate the flow of information from the original cherry picking of intelligence to the deliberate refusal to hear senior military officers when they warned of the potential for chaos to the continually inflated claims about the progress in building up an indigenous iraqi army
7491666 for one thing i strongly suspect that these attempts to enforce a single authorized version of the truth have backfired
7491667 the distaste for debate and dissent has another higher cost fighting terrorists whatever method you choose depends on making alliances at home and abroad it depends on a consensus of the civilized world and i wonder whether the discrediting of honest critics the unwillingness to trust anyone except a cohort of diehard loyalists has undermined the unity of purpose essential to such a struggle
7491668 besides a decided preference for operating in the dark the bush administration has contributed to the woes of the press in another way it has helped create a toxic climate for the press by inflaming the polarization of our public at least since the election of 2000 with its attendant questions of legitimacy some of the wide reasonable middle of the american electorate has gravitated to angry and intolerant fringes right and left there are many reasons for this including the proliferation of partisan blogs hate mongering radio broadcasts and intemperate television shout shows but a president plays a considerable role in setting the tone of public discourse and the tone of public discourse in my country has been nasty it has been nasty by design dividing the electorate into mistrustful camps and pandering to their fears was an explicit strategy of the presidents political wizard karl rove
7491669 too often though the critics are shrill personal and humorless neo bolsheviks and after our decision to report on the governments warrantless wiretapping program some members of the administrations amen chorus proposed that the times be charged with treason under the espionage act a right wing radio pundit suggested that i be put to death and another defender of the national interest posted maps to my apartment and my publishers on the internet for the benefit of any lunatics who wanted to drop by and set us straight those of you who are acquainted with new york apartment life can imagine how that went over with my co op board
7491670 and i would argue that in this clattering interconnected dangerous world journalism that cuts through the noise has never been needed more we have a war going very badly in iraq and another one in afghanistan where our declaration of victory looks very premature
7491671 third we are agnostic as to where a story may lead we do not go into a story with an agenda or a pre conceived notion we do not manipulate or hide facts to advance an agenda we strive to preserve our independence from political and economic interests including our own advertisers we do not work in the service of a party or an industry or even a country when there are competing views of a situation we aim to reflect them as clearly and fairly as we can
7491672 when the fairtax becomes law it will be like waving a magic wand releasing us from pain and unfairness
7491673 done solely to make revenues under the fairtax seem larger than they really are
7491674 i supported the president george w bush when he asked the congress for authority to stand up against weapons of mass destruction in iraq
7491675 taxpayers who have been filing electronically to revert to paper filing
7491676 i would hope he could be trusted to secure the borders but given his track record in arkansas i dont see the conservative he has portrayed himself to be in iowa
7491677 we are a better country than to punish children for what their parents did
7491678 aside from the scholarships if a child of an illegal immigrant went through high school in arkansas he would get the same in state benefits as other arkansas residents do yet if a student was coming in from colorado they would pay higher tuition
7491679 the difference is if a student comes in from colorado he hasnt been educated in our high schools
7491680 he hasnt had our courses but if youve had a child thats been there since he was five or six years old or even since he was 13 and hes had his entire high school experience sitting along side arkansas students the point is is he better off going to college and becoming a taxpayer as opposed to not going to college and potentially becoming a tax taker
7491681 it was a proposal for merit based scholarships based on meeting academic requirements and applying for citizenship and remaining drug and alcohol free
7491682 there was no question in arkansas that he supported in state tuition
7491683 to say you shouldnt punish the kids for their parents mistake is wrong because its not necessarily the kids the requirement was three years residence in arkansas a lot of non traditional students get their geds and get in state tuition
7491684 how is our government benefiting from an abandoned 1 year old im thinking as a parent if i was in that position and my only crime was plucking a chicken to feed my family i didnt hurt anyone it would be different if the crime was robbing a bank with a gun or making methamphetamine
7491685 it was wrong to criticize the agents they dont make the laws they enforce them
7491686 huckabees concerns surrounded the fact that federal authorities didnt contact the state and local authorities about the raid
7491687 once they went in and made the raid the parents were hauled off to jail and the kids were left to fend for themselves and taken into state custody
7491688 the governor felt as if there should have been federal state and local coordination prior to the raid so that the children could have been taken care of once again he does not feel that children should be penalized or punished for the actions of their parents
7491689 it wasnt something he huckabee walked the halls of the capitol touting
7491690 but bob trevino was actively in support of it and he was one of the governors main guys he wouldnt have been that active if the bill didnt have the governors support
7491691 in 2005 i signed a bill that didnt allow illegals to get drivers licenses so i dont support the idea of illegals driving or voting
7491692 in motor voter 2001 there would be in essence making the front line dmv worker the entry level state employee responsible for being an immigration agent and checking the documentation
7491693 i think the most important thing to do is to make sure that is done at the federal level so that if youre going to check for authentic identification you do it with people who arent at the entry level of a state office
7491694 the 376th air expeditionary wing provided two large fire trucks an ambulance and nearly two dozen medical and fire and crash support personnel to the scene of the accident

7491728 the traditional approach to financial planning in which the interaction between the taxable and tax deferred accounts is largely ignored

7491811 one of the funnest games ive been a part of in a long time
7491812 weve got a day to regroup and we probably need to
7491813 a few of us were talking that its probably a lot bigger than just a regular win given the way the blue jays are playing and that theyre trying to catch up to us

7491815 hes stepped in and been a valuable member of our ballclub

7491817 looked like he just got done with a 15 round fight
7491818 the fact that ellsbury stayed in and played that game it might be a little over dramatic but i thought he grew up a little bit today
7491819 he understood where we were physically with the rest of our team and what he can do by staying in the game i thought that was huge
7491820 i got up on the wall there and got up as high as i could and made the catch

7491824 these are people i would never ever ever talk to even in a social situation
7491825 but you have to go up to them and ask do you want chicken or the vegetarian option and when you start talking to them that way when youre getting them their coffee and their dessert a natural sort of conversation starts happening

7491937 ich habe im fl ming schon lange nicht mehr aufgelegt das finde ich schon sehr schade
7491938 hip hop veranstaltungen und techno feten f r jugendliche rentieren sich nicht mehr
7491939 meist stehen viele leute drau en w hrend nur wenige drinnen feiern
7491940 da waren die jugendschutzgesetze noch nicht so streng und man durfte in ffentlichen geb uden noch rauchen heute muss drau en geraucht werden und jugendlichen ist der alkohol und tabakkonsum verboten
7491941 manche m gen den einen dj nicht der rest den anderen nicht
7491942 ich w rde eher klubs mit gemischter musik bevorzugen an stelle der standardisierten technomusik
7491943 no es normal que estemos alegres y contentos y nos felicitemos porque nos llevamos un cad ver en una caja
7491944 i see a solid gold lampstand witha bowl at the top and seven lights on it with seven channels to the lights 3 also there ware two olive trees by it one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left
7491945 this is the word of the lord to zerubbabel not by might nor by power but by my spirit says the lord almighty
7491946 violated the law as they crossed the line of giving instructions putting an excessive psychological burden on him judge koji maki said
7491947 inappropriate words but said that such treatment by supervisors was unavoidable
7491948 more officers of the self defence forces are committing suicide the officers mother told a meeting of supporters after the verdict as quoted by
7491949 if the self defence forces had given consideration to what the problem was without trying to cover things up this lawsuit would have ended sooner she said
7491950 the disadvantage of that is that we have nothing to go off of
7491951 but the advantage is that we really get to set the direction for agriculture in ghazni province
7491952 the commanders on the ground want as many of these teams as they can get
7491953 they see the good in what the teams can do long term to turn the tide and create stability in the farming regions
7491954 there has been some but not enough to meet the needs of afghanistan revitalizing agriculture is one of the key priorities for our government to the extent that we get technical assistance in military form or civilian form it helps us a great deal
7491955 ive been an infantry officer my entire career 25 years
7491956 this is very different i always thought my command would be in a combat mission but this is a good mission you really get to see the effects youre having
7491957 the challenges weve had getting states on board is because the guard is so busy with missions throughout the theater
7491958 we compete with resources with the entire national guard but having said that the local farm boys of the army guard have come out of the woodwork
7491959 it looks like barren wasteland until you drop water on it
7491960 i dont know what kind of magic stuff is in the soil
7491961 we have not seen any in ghazni but if we did we would not do anything about it thats another units job
7491962 whatever they can sell their harvest for at that time is what they get the rest of it goes to waste they have no means to store it or preserve it
7491963 whatever they can capture and collect at their spot is what they have available water management is the largest issue and it cannot be resolved in one year it will be handed off to future teams
7491964 just in the small amount of time our boys have been on the ground theyve gone after some quick hit infrastructure support projects to start making a turn for the local farmers
7491965 we need technical expertise to use in that secure environment
7491966 thats part of an effective counterinsurgency strategy if we dont help the people with their livelihoods and create jobs it will be really hard to win their hearts and minds
7491967 i read the other day that canada throwed that guy out
7491968 good for them the day jimmy carter became president he welcomed all the draft dodgers home i didnt like that oh no i had no time for him after that
7491969 what they should have done is extradited him directly to the u s because hes being deported hes still free
7491970 its way past time for this guy to face the music
7491971 canada was wrong to rule against jeremy and his family all they seek is to live in peace
7491972 i think he should lose a lot of privileges that red blooded americans have
7491973 he shouldnt be able to hold any state or federal jobs
7491974 ive had the opportunity to speak out against the war no offense to the soldiers over there i have respect for them as soldiers but it was a bogus war based on false pretenses and im happy to have not taken part in it
7491975 they should round him up and have him executed all deserters should be executed on the spot in times of war deserters should be executed
7491976 ill tell them i went through basic training served in the 82nd for three years also i applied for conscientious objectors status and was denied i tried to work within the provisions of the army just because youre a soldier doesnt mean you abdicate your responsibility to be a moral being
7491977 ill end up with whatever they want to give me
7491978 he knew what he was getting into i just thought it was wrong
7491979 maybe if he had a chance and fulfilled his obligation if thats even possible
7491980 then you wonder if he had the kids to avoid going to jail but still
7491981 most of those guys got drafted in if they were a conscientious objector it wasnt their choice when you go to a recruiting station and sign a contract you need to honor the contract read the fine print no i do not have any compassion for this guy
7491982 i feel it is every persons duty to serve if theyre able to i felt like i had to do it as a citizen of the freest nation
7491983 theres no draft anymore he didnt get drafted into the army
7491984 he chose it as a career thats just like me choosing to come to certified brake no matter how tough it gets i have to stick with it these guys choose it for a career he turned his back on the united states the way i see it
7491985 they ought to give him a double dose because he volunteered for it
7491986 i hope there are lots of people in fayetteville even though they feel differently about the war than he does who would be able to respect the kind of integrity and courage he has shown
7491987 it was a tough time almost 36 hours it was very hard for many of us
7491988 they are very brave they are very strong i am proud of them
7491989 in this media war it was impossible for them israel to win because they have no case for what they are doing to your port and to your borders
7491990 we call for more activities to break the unfair siege imposed on our people
7491991 this decision was about these boats we will see what happens with any future boats
7491992 if you are going to be retrospective it has to be immediately useful
7491993 any information about the future what went wrong in the beginning and how we can fix it im open ears
7491994 we are soldiers still a journey back to the battlefields of vietnam
7491995 the last book didnt finish the story and we thought especially after our trip back to the battlefield there was another story of interest to tell and so we decided to tell it
7491996 its a different book its not just a continuation of the war its post war
7491997 general an sat with general moore on the bus and they talked about their careers for having been worlds apart were remarkably similar
7491998 i had called everyone all together on the field and we formed a circle
7491999 we had our arms around each other and we had a moment of silence for the soldiers who died on both sides and when that circle broke up general an walked over to me and stuck out his hand and we shook hands and very surprising he reached over and kissed me on both cheeks it was totally an unexpected event
7492000 i had a compulsion to go back there in peacetime and walk that ground on which i lost so many men and on which the first major battle of the vietnam war was fought
7492001 and i had a compulsion to not only walk the battlefield in the daytime but to spend the night there and read the feelings that came into my head during the night
7492002 do you hate someone forever when the war is over the battle happened 43 years ago you cant live on hate and what we found is that the veterans of a war even from opposing sides have more in common than any veteran has with any civilian whos never known war

7492037 a good will gesture aimed at reinvigorating the faltering peace process
7492038 there will be no peace without the release of all palestinians imprisoned in israel
7492039 we will not rest until the prisoners are freed and the jails are empty
7492040 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7492041 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7492042 we hope this process will succeed and well get to peace security an stability in the region we are working energetically toward this
7492043 you will try to explain the reasoning behind this so that we will understand
7492044 we as a coaching staff are extremely pleased and proud of the effort today by the whole team
7492045 hopefully we can build on these past three games here and continue adding points in trying to achieve our main goal which is to make the playoffs
7492046 the guys who got the chance today took it with both hands and made the best of it
7492047 i think jimenez deserves to be praised because of the way he played today
7492048 we can attack we have some threat on the flanks defensively i think were doing a better job
7492049 i think individually and collectively we didnt meet the standard that we set in the last couple of games and to go down a goal and not play well is tough no matter where youre at
7492050 its just great that we have more competition for places more options and hopefully i can decide what is best for the club
7492051 why are we more likely to discuss a gossipy rumor at a party than a policy error that can actually make a material difference to our own lives
7492052 after consultation of the entire board may i submit the name for approval of the name of giovanni also known as bunny sgabmelluri as the next superintendent of education

7492059 i bumped into him sheva at sandy lane and we arranged a game not knowing what a demon he is i saw stephen hunt of reading there too and told him wed got a match against shev and his mate
7492060 we got an absolute battering it was all over after nine holes never mind 18 shevchenko plays off a four handicap and he looks even better than that he normally plays left handed but i think he was prepared to play right handed on the second nine to give us a chance
7492061 we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the
7492062 it turns out that we dont feel or see any advantages from wto membership if they exist at all but we are carrying the burden we need to make this clear to our partners

7492077 flash floods following heavy rains for nearly a week have caused major rivers in gambella to burst their banks submerging residential areas and farmlands and forcing 18 000 people to be displaced
7492078 so far we have reports of the deaths of three people including one child
7492079 we are taking precautions but the vast number of crocodiles swarming the gilo river may harm unsuspecting people
7492080 indications are there will be continued heavy rains in the coming weeks to hit gambella
7492081 but there is great need for shelter blankets and cooking utensils for the displaced people who are living in open air and under trees
7492082 wolfe island is a very small municipality with only 1 100 full time residents and about 3 000 in the summer
7492083 weve seen significant changes over the years and now have very little employment on the island we have become a community of commuters but we are still in denial i think its safe to say we are yearning for the good old days with economic opportunities for our youth
7492084 i want to make sure that if they go up they are put up in a responsible manner
7492085 we have built a 100 million tourism industry and that will plummet if they are put up just anywhere i have a lot of friends who visit from places like toronto and montreal and i can tell you they dont want to come here to look at wind turbines
7492086 i can tell you this if you go ahead with projects here you will be changing council during the course of them
7492087 its a really difficult process and i wish we had spent more time training our council and staff about the different aspects
7492088 we also learned that you have to be very sensitive and flexible throughout the process to address the concerns of your community

7492117 i think he needs to focus on some more pressing priorities
7492118 before there are any discussions of scotland going it alone at the olympics he would have to look at the facilities and the resources which have been put into scotland in the first place
7492119 we dont have an international facility for cycling and we dont have the coaching structures in place in fact we dont have anything in place so the whole idea is ridiculous ive not lived in scotland for nine years because there is nowhere for me to train im a scottish athlete but im proud to perform in a british team
7492120 its a non starter and he should consult athletes first before he comments scotland would have to build a new slalom course first and they would have to build a velodrome
7492121 i am very proud to be scottish to have been born in aberdeen and have edinburgh as my home town but i am also very proud to represent great britain and everything that stands for which is not just scotland
7492122 im as proud to wear the union jack as i am the saltire i dont have a problem separating my pride in being a scot from being british at the same time
7492123 if you look at jamaica a small island nation they won gold silver and bronze in the womens sprint theyve got world records theyve won the mens the womens 100 and 200 metres and the relay
7492124 this is an exceptionally brilliant nation at the same time a small nation scotland can compete on the world stage we proved that in the olympics and a scottish team at the olympics is the future
7492125 what i would say to them do irish athletes want to rejoin the uk and be part of the uk team
7492126 do we want to get rid of the gb team and have a european team because a european team would sweep the board
7492127 so i think you have to think about whether or not its appropriate in the level you represent your own country in i think its quite right you represent your own country

7492221 dal comune di modena lesempio giusto per tutte le altre pubbliche amministrazioni ditalia
7492222 lassociazione matrimonialisti italiani saluta con soddisfazione la stretta al dilagante fenomeno tutto nostrano dei matrimoni di convenienza
7492223 senza adeguati controlli caso per caso non si potr mai arginare questo fenomeno che nulla centra con lamore e lintegrazione purtroppo in italia un clandestino anche con precedenti penali pu contrarre matrimonio esibendo semplicemente il suo documento di identit il matrimonio una volta celebrato sana ogni posizione del clandestino e nulla rileva se esso stesso si dimostra una autentica farsa
7492224 in italia il matrimonio istituzione oramai in crisi come indica listat oggi addirittura utilizzato quale strumento per scavalcare le leggi dello stato
7492225 il comune di modena citt da sempre civile e tollerante con la sua denuncia alla questura ha fornito lesempio giusto per tutte le pubbliche amministrazioni italiane
7492226 al riguardo esiste gi un protocollo dintesa sottoscritto il 10 agosto 2007 dal clacs cisl arte dallugl creativi dalluil unsa e dal nilsa noleggiatori associati di libri scolastici in italia che consentirebbe di noleggiare i libri nuovi o usati al 55 del prezzo di copertina con un risparmio quindi di quasi la met vedi al sito http www
7492227 nellaccordo prevista tra laltro anche la possibilit di riscattare i libri a fine anno continua capodanno
7492228 un progetto che stato gi sperimentato negli ultimi anni scolastici in alcune scuole superiori consentendo un risparmio del 45 sulla dotazione libraria prosegue capodanno
7492229 quali sono i motivi per i quali limpegno sottoscritto che doveva partire dallanno scolastico 2008 2009 ed aveva validit per 3 anni sembra totalmente ignorato in campania si domanda capodanno
7492230 se proprio nonostante la petizione con oltre diecimila firme per trasferirla altrove deve rimanere in sede stabile in via scarlatti afferma capodanno almeno abbiate cura
7492231 sse has concluded that the best route to the site will still be via the turning at the old school house and strath brora an application for listed building consent will therefore be lodged shortly
7492232 the old school house building will be renovated as part of the works this will enable it to be returned to a beneficial use at the end of the project and to improve its overall appearance
7492233 it remains my view that an extension to the kilbraur wind farm road offered an ideal access solution for the gordonbush wind farm and i had hoped there could be a successful conclusion to the engineering site assessment and the negotiation of access agreements with the relevant land owners for this route any proposal to use the a9 through golspie and brora is a cause of great concern and can only result in nuisance extreme disturbance and potential structural damage to the road and to neighbouring properties
7492234 in the past i have made written representations to the scottish government and highland council on this matter and urged them to secure an access using the established kilbraur wind farm route with a comparatively short extension to strath brora
7492235 this route would leave the a9 south of golspie at drummuie travel up to dunrobin glen and on through the existing kilbraur wind farm development
7492236 this would result in no significant traffic movement through a built up area this is a clear transport solution which avoids the two settlements of golspie and brora
7492237 i will now be in contact with sse to seek clarification of the situation and if the intended route is via the old school house i will seek a full explanation of the reasons the kilbraur route is not to be used
7492238 dismay was expressed at the prospect of these components travelling through golspie and brora and the chairman will discuss the matter with local authority planners

7492241 im having a ball its the perfect piece for me because theres poetry and monologue and character
7492242 its not like a musical where the pieces are set so my challenge has been to make the music and dance organic just like its part of our culture
7492243 i really wanted a multi generational cast i didnt want everybody under 30 as i explained to them we interpret pain differently yes some of us are hardened and bitter and callous but some of us are hurt and open and vulnerable and some of us are wounded and do not heal we are broken and some of us heal to the love of other people so i have to be sure that these ways of being in pain come through
7492244 she is a professional translator and im familiar with the sci fi tech jargon so thats how we work summing up our knowledges
7492245 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7492246 if i were in the obama camp i would lock
7492247 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7492248 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7492249 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7492250 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7492251 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7492252 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7492253 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7492254 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7492255 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot
7492256 the new policy would let agents open preliminary terrorism investigations after mining public records and intelligence to build a profile of traits that taken together were deemed suspicious
7492257 travel to regions of the world known for terrorist activity and access to weapons or military training along with the persons race or ethnicity
7492258 long term surveillance interviewing neighbors and work mates recruiting informants and searching commercial databases for information on people
7492259 race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
7492260 pretext interviews in which agents do not honestly represent themselves while questioning a subjects neighbors and work colleagues

7492263 theres a whole new second generation elite of the revolutionary guard irgc who indoctrinate their troops with the belief in the need to hasten the advent of the imam this has also spread to hizballah in lebanon
7492264 he represents a larger elite and wider trend hence he is more dangerous since even if he were to disappear through elections or other means the trend he represents would remain strong this is in contrast to hitler who had he disappeared even as late as 1939 there is great doubt that wwii would have occurred
7492265 balance between the supreme leader and the president is no longer clearly in the favor of the former as it was with ahmadinejads predecessors now the president has the direct support of the revolutionary guard the regimes mainstay

7492283 this musical is coming from the mind of dana marschz the teacher and he doesnt think its funny and hes not trying to be offensive

7492313 its made an impact already in terms of their presence on the street they way they talk to our young maori the way they connect with a lot of kaumatua so they are having a significant impact in terms of their communications skills but i think already in the shore term their productivity levels thjat have come back in terms of reducing crime in key areas has made a huge impact
7492314 they need to go home to their wa kainga and learn their own dialect here you can perform you can practice you can learn the linguistics but you can never learn your dialect in a whare wananga they need to go home to their own wharekura their own marae

7492327 another one of our members of parliament eliah jembere has been arrested at parliament
7492328 its clearly a strategy to eliminate our members and reverse our majority in parliament
7492329 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7492330 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet

7492339 it is like a wedding celebration for the palestinian people but our joy will not be complete until all palestinian prisoners are released

7492360 i was never worried or afraid on kilimanjaro on mount elbrus i was scared to death on summit day i had to trust my guides completely as there was low visibility and i had no idea where we were at any time for me to completely trust and give control to someone else is a big stretch but it was enlightening and i learned a lot from it

7492381 ive played all my cricket at middlesex i grew up here since i was 15
7492382 theres a lot of potential i think its exciting times for middlesex and were on the way up
7492383 all one wants to see is progress as a team and i think our twenty20 victory this summer made my decision easier
7492384 ive grown up watching middlesex reach the heights of winning trophies with mike gatting and mark ramprakash angus fraser and phil tufnell
7492385 we won our first game against a very tough south african side
7492386 im sure south africa will hit us hard on tuesday sami patel was outstanding with the ball on his international debut the way he took to the big stage was very good

7492388 such a combined fund would satisfy the requirements of the european fisheries fund that seek other public sector grants to match those from the european fund the support of the fishing sector is key to the local economy the lack of financial support may effect the sustainability of some businesses leading to the demise of the fishing sector effecting the number of jobs and businesses in place
7492389 this would enable a consistent approach for the businesses in the local fishing sector as occurred with the former fund the association would act as the first point of advice and information for the fund eligibility criteria for the financial support will be established and suitability for funding will determined at this stage
7492390 it should be recognised that the local fishing sector is unlikely to create any new jobs in the short term but the fund can enable fishing businesses to become more sustainable thus helping safeguard local jobs
7492391 officials said if it had gone into the air without federal aviation administration approval it could have been considered a crime

7492403 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7492404 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7492405 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7492406 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7492407 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7492408 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good

7492440 when nicolas sarkozy the french president rushed to moscow earlier this month to mediate the crisis over georgia he found the new russian president dmitri a medvedev to be calm even sanguine about prospects for a solution
7492441 but the tone was wildly different when mr sarkozy heard from vladimir v putin mr putin was virulent in denouncing georgian actions as atrocities and he expressed such deep antipathy toward georgian leaders that it made the war seem personal
7492442 mr sarkozys report has added to a sense of bewilderment in washington about how to deal with what is now a two headed government in moscow with mr putin still the dominant partner occupying what is technically the subservient role
7492443 american and european officials say there is no doubt that it is mr

7492707 saya baru saja selesai penggambaran program raya af6 yang akan disiarkan pada musim raya nanti di astro ria kami menjalani penggambaran program itu sejak 5 hingga 12 ogos lalu saya juga akan terbabit dengan rakaman uniknya ramadan bersama bintang af6 yang lain selain itu saya juga terpilih untuk mengalih suara drama di saluran disney iaitu camp rock bagi watak utamanya shane grey selain saya amylea farah shawal dan adifashla pun terbabit
7492708 saat ini memang saya tiada hasrat untuk berlakon biarlah saya membina nama terlebih dulu sebagai penyanyi biarlah saya melakukan setapak demi setapak dan andai suatu hari nanti saya sudah bersedia pastinya saya juga ingin mengembangkan bakat sebagai pelakon
7492709 sebelum ini saya pernah berlakon beberapa buah drama termasuk kasih suci tapi semuanya sekadar pelakon pembantu dan ekstra dalam drama ampang medikal saya dapat merasai pengalaman menjadi doktor tak dapat jadi doktor betul betul berlakon jadi doktor pun kira oklah saya masih baru dan hijau dalam dunia ini harapnya kehadiran saya akan disedari dan saya ingin berkongsi sedikit bakat yang ada
7492710 saya yang mula memperkenalkan linda ke dalam beberapa produksi dan alhamdulillah semakin hari dia mula mendapat tempat membikin drama dan telefilem untuk drama ini saya percaya kepada cita rasa linda dan pengarah
7492711 mengenai soal cinta saya seboleh bolehnya tidak mahu terjebak dengan sebarang perhubungan lagi saya sedang membaikpulih hati yang pernah retak rentetan cinta sebelum ini saya tidak mahu hati saya yang sudah kecewa kembali retak kalau saya mahu bercinta sekalipun biarlah saya mulakan dengan hati yang baru
7492712 saya tidak menonton apa apa drama atau filem yang menjurus kepada genre yang sama dengan ampang medikal kerana saya bimbang akan terikut ikut dengan watak yang sedia ada
7492713 sebenarnya saya buka klinik itu untuk tujuan penggambaran bagi mana mana produksi yang berminat ia ada set atau studio khas yang boleh digunakan untuk drama atau filem yang membabitkan babak atau suasana di pusat perubatan
7492714 klinik dengan keluasan 1200 kaki persegi ini dimuatkan dengan ruang menunggu bilik doktor wad kaunter pertanyaan dan beberapa lagi ruang berkaitan alhamdulillah perniagaan klinik saya ini semakin mendapat sambutan saya hanya mengenakan caj rm400 sehari

7492724 we do not believe that any of the lost laptops contained sensitive or classified information
7492725 this is another example of this governments woeful failure when it comes to data security
7492726 given the sensitivity of the home offices work including its lead role in the fight against terrorism this is all the more worrying
7492727 this is of course also the government department with responsibility for id cards there now needs to be an urgent review of what data was lost on these laptops its sensitivity and possible impact on any work as well as a wider review of the home offices security policy
7492728 if the home office cannot safeguard such basic equipment how can they be trusted to deliver id cards containing the personal data of millions
7492729 the home office is determined to learn from earlier security breaches in government and is committed to ensuring that our systems and processes to protect personal data are as good as they can be

7492746 its a new turbo diesel estimated at 50 mpg on the highway
7492747 obamacans will flock to it along with some of the other 300 000 plus buyers who line up for the accord each year
7492748 obama wants 4 billion for detroit to build new small cars and ford is already planning on building it in north america
7492749 they could use the incentives to make a hybrid or diesel version for real 50 mpg capability
7492750 it was perhaps a little too extravagant for a democrat
7492751 now hes driving the politicians stand by a ford escape hybrid but he hasnt been able to shake the 300c image

7492854 for me robinho is the same player as always he is an important player who should be part of this project
7492855 i think that he knows that he can be successful at real madrid it is a subject that you need to resolve in the best way possible but we are all selfish and the best would be that he stays with us for a long time
7492856 anthony would benefit from going out and getting 20 games hes good enough to go and play in the championship

7492923 it had got to the stage when my mum was expecting me to get arrested that at any time there would be a phone call from the police saying that i was in big trouble
7492924 it was when i was half way through year 10 when i went off the rails i was about 14 and it was just because i was hanging round with the wrong people you just did the same things as your mates
7492925 the norm would be to go round to peoples houses and watch telly or hanging out in the streets id gone to monton green primary school and was at moor side in swinton
7492926 we would just smoke a load of weed thats all we did mum knows about it now but she didnt at the time what they do say to me now though is that they were constantly expecting a phone call every week someone would be getting arrested there would always be a fight or someone getting caught
7492927 one day at school one of my mates got arrested outside school with 1 000 worth of weed on him school wasnt about study for us
7492928 id save up the money from my paper round to buy more drugs
7492929 at that time i was smoking about 60 worth at the weekends between a small group of us during the week id just save up the money i got from a paper round to buy more
7492930 its all a blur but they called for back up and moved us across the road a scuffle broke out and then bottles got thrown in the end it was more like a riot and i was chared with violent disorder
7492931 for a while i totally didnt understand what was going on my dad turned up he wasnt mad he was just so disappointed eleven people were arrested and charged
7492932 the case first went through salford magistrates court and then manchester crown court the trial lasted three weeks and we had to be there every day i was aquitted and the judge agreed that there was no evidence to link me and that i shouldnt have a record
7492933 it was a close shave and was enough to make me realise it was time to change my life dad had been such a rock and he had come with me every day to court and even had to take loads of time off work
7492934 now i am training to be a strucural engineer and am a trainee building scientist
7492935 i started mountain biking a year after id got arrested in 2004 my first bike was a trails bike i got it just for messing about on the streets with
7492936 then i met some friends through riding at rivington and through my work i love the pigeon tower ride and around the howgills as well as jacobs ladder
7492937 mountain biking is a pure buzz its just such good fun and you make great mates better than anyone i ever knew with drugs
7492938 i would totally say to other young people not to be put off by the image that it is uncool to be out on a bike that is just so not true cost is not a big problem it doesnt have to be expensive and you get so much out of it you have so much more confidence in your ability and have to develop determination
7492939 life is like a snowball the really important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill

7492966 flash floods following heavy rains for nearly a week have caused major rivers in gambella to burst their banks submerging residential areas and farmlands and forcing 18 000 people to be displaced

7492971 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
7492972 without research i fail to see how making alcohol available to younger people is a good idea
7492973 im not convinced theres research that validates a movement toward that and i dont think we should be making rules that would put alcohol in young peoples hands easier especially without knowing all the facts
7492974 starting next month nonstop flights between new york and 25 domestic and international cities will disappear and service to another 55 cities will be sharply curtailed according to an airline ticket research site that analyzed fall flight schedules at the request of crains
7492975 if its mostly seniors flying to florida expecting 200 fares those flights are going to get cut
7492976 we have to keep a close eye on the situation

7492982 hes healthy he has a great attitude hes ready to resume his career
7492983 we had him working out and were running him through some drills
7492984 he actually tried to go through some practices for a day or so he could do that and then he had to take a couple days off

7492988 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7492989 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7492990 we believe jo and his agent are coming down on tuesday or wednesday to hopefully tie things up
7492991 theyve both signed for another year so have two years left
7492992 both have played huge parts in the last few years and i think aaron was part of a group of players who kept us in the football league
7492993 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7492994 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7492995 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority
7492996 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7492997 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation
7492998 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused
7492999 im not trying to teach men how to be a pick up artist or a stud i want to show men how to build self esteem build a life for themselves which in turn will attract women
7493000 aussie guys have fallen through the cracks we like to think of australian men as bold and confident and a lot of them arent
7493001 the biggest thing is not to look cool but to have a life with lots of interests become involved in your life look after yourself and youre primed to meet someone
7493002 be a gentleman respect yourself even if youre funny and charming youre not going to get far with a woman if you smell
7493003 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7493004 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7493005 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7493006 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7493007 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7493008 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

7493015 precisely what would a prudent party member general belief as respects immigration undoubtedly occur
7493016 overall violence is down at least 80 percent since the surge began and ethno sectarian violence the kind that seemed to be sucking iraq into all out civil war in 2006 is down by over 90 percent
7493017 by and large whats left of the insurgency is just trying to hang on
7493018 as we have surged into neighborhoods to protect the iraqi people earning their trust and benefiting from their help violence has dropped and locals have turned against the jihadists
7493019 the iraqi people are going about their business and business is thriving it is so more and more i see it in places i could not go even six months ago
7493020 the simple fact is that sending in over 20 000 additional troops isnt the answer in fact its a tragic mistake
7493021 it wont end the violence it wont provide security it wont turn back the clock and avoid the civil war that is already underway it wont deter terrorists who have a completely different agenda it wont rein in the militias
7493022 the group will focus on education religion and social justice
7493023 el cinisme del pp respecte al finan ament auton mic no t l mits
7493024 el pp viu en un m n dil lusi i dengany als valencians al veure la palla en ull ali i no la biga en el propi tots els valencians sadonen que les reivindicacions al govern zapatero s n un pur teatre partidista i electoral una cortina de fum per a intentar desviar latenci dels problemes financers que el propi pp ha creat en la nostra comunitat i que llasten la nostra economia i les nostres possibilitats mentres reivindica 1 000 milions de transfer ncia per a atendre la poblaci dilapida m s de 2 000 milions en fastos en mala gesti i en crear una administraci paral lela al servici del pp

7493026 no s n cre bles les cr tiques del ppcv a un model de finan ament implantat per jos mar a aznar quan a m s es van negar a discutir en els debats de la reforma de lestatut la inclusi de sistema que ens permetera parlar ara amb for a i incl s amb lacord de les corts en la confer ncia sectorial sobre finan ament auton mic
7493027 estem encantats que el pp es puge al carro de les reivindicacions hist riques de lesquerra en este pa s inclosa la petici de la publicaci de les balances fiscals quan plantegem que el model de finan ament ja estava obsolet a i que a m s no permetia ajustar ho als canvis per ens temem que el que en realitat vol este partit s disposar de m s diners per a continuar gastant en publicitar se i creant empreses p bliques que perden diners a cabassades que sescapen al control de les corts i daltres institucions de control i per a mantindre el to reivindicatiu quan el pp parla que els valencians es beneficien dels pressupostos de la generalitat ens temem que estos valencians tenen nom cognoms i direcci postal

7493036 todos vivimos bajo el cielo pero algunos levantamos los ojos hacia las estrellas
7493037 on voit ici ce quoi paris a chapper avec sa lib ration
7493038 until recently in hindi films the terrorist was a guy with a beard but nobody tried to find out why he was a terrorist roja and bombay were all politically pliant
7493039 it is the ideology of power that rules it determines the way the wind blows in bollywood when right wing parties ruled then the movies articulated their world view in a shrill manner there was demonising of muslims under the cover of attacking pakistan actually it reflected on to muslims of india too who had nothing to do with pakistan
7493040 i had made zakhm which held a mirror to the hideousness of the right wing
7493041 cinema projects the time and society in the 1960s and early 70s we used to have war films because we had wars why just us even hollywood used to have war films then now we are living in times of harmony so we show that why talk of muslim psyche in films we have projected human psyche in our film there are hindu fundamentalists christian and sikh fundamentalists too the fight today is between fundamentalists and modernists bollywood cannot afford to show muslims in poor light any more as there has been an internet explosion over the past 10 years people have come together
7493042 i was fed up of doing the same kind of cinema it was important for me to reinvent myself without caring about the box office
7493043 in my film there are points which touch you in the film a hindu boy converts to islam with all his heart because he knows only the truth will come out in the truth serum he quotes from the quran too it is the first of its kind conversion on screen from a majority to a minority community with no coming back i found nothing untoward in having a central character as muslim because i believe your story has to grip the audience i am putting a wedge between terror and islam with this film mukhbir is a fight between a radical muslim and a moderate one and an attempt to show there is no sanction to terror in islam
7493044 i looked at it from the point of a common man co existing in a society when i was writing this film my inspiration was the times we live in any act of terror affects everybody i never looked at the story from a sectarian point of view now i am glad the critics as well as the audiences have accepted the film it is a rare confluence
7493045 in dhokha i looked into that ideology which clamours for militant expression my films gave a voice to the muslim moderate usually ignored in films as in life i showed a moderate muslims story because in real life also many moderate muslims are forced to be mute they feel that whatever they do theyd find themselves in trouble if some had radical views that went against their own community they were dubbed kafir if they spoke for the community they were accused of treason the film did not sell tickets at the box office window but i would call it a document of courage
7493046 with glorious exceptions filmmakers have always had to play the handmaiden of politics even mani ratnam many years ago faced something similar to what i experienced with zakhm things have changed now films reflect the secular ethos of the country people are more open about the minorities and it is easier to make such films because of the colour of the government in power
7493047 after baazi and manno bhabhi i am used to it but the fact that i had two costumes in one was a little tricky it was a little tough with the wig
7493048 its a wacky idea but very challenging from make up to costume there was a lot of minute detailing
7493049 i had to focus a lot on my body and its movements because i had to quickly switch over this required constant attention
7493050 aamir is already so fair but we gave him a fairer skin tone to clearly distinguish between the male and female sides and pink lipstick since the colour suits him best
7493051 i remember we had a tough time giving him the look of a cabaret dancer for baazi because it was the role of dancer we had to enhance artificial assets wax his chest hands and legs manno bhabhi was more of a make up and hair thing
7493052 for this ad we created the difference by giving him two skin tones while the female part is given a lighter shade for the male character we chose to stick to his natural tone
7493053 det r helt och h llet till tet att spela fel och fult men aldrig utan k nslor
7493054 stories about the fall out between me and vipul are absolute hogwash why would that happen
7493055 i have always maintained that i love my work the most and that was the case with singh is kinng as well soon after the film was declared a superhit within 3 days of its release i was busy working on its my life when did i actually have time to get into any sort of quarrels or unpleasant situation with vipul
7493056 we were partying day in and night out throughout the first weekend of the films release then aneesji got busy with his next project while i too came to london tell me when could we have actually got into verbal duel as has been claimed in the interim it is irresponsible reporting at its worst
7493057 in fact all through my conversation i continued to maintain that i would love to work with aneesji in future as well even when i was asked about directing the sequel to singh is kinng i acknowledged that there was no one better equipped to do the job than aneesji himself i also stated that even if he was busy i would continue to pursue him to take on the project and even in the worst case scenario i would want him to be associated with the project in the capacity of a creative advisor now what can one do when in spite of such positive statements being made about a fellow director some random angle is highlighted to make it sound like a bitter war in the happening it is disgusting to see something like this being done just in order to come up with a spicy story
7493058 there are people in the industry who would love to create a rift between two people if they are successful there are feeds from these so called sources which make matters ugly in our case too there was certain negativity in place ever since work began on singh is kinng a year back people used to challenge the very aspect of two established directors coming together for a project they said yeh project nahi ban sakta kyonki vipul aur anees ki sensibilities different hai
7493059 there were many who would tell me that films directed by aneesji take time to be completed and hence be very sure before he comes on the project but see after initially announcing 15th august 2008 as the release date for the film we not just came a week earlier but also did record business at the box office no wonder the same people are now trying to create a rift between the two of us
7493060 there have been good reviews and terrific word of mouth with everyone acknowledging the fact that singh is kinng has given audience a paisa vasool entertainment but guess what is the biggest compliment that i got it was just two simple words thank you from shefali shah vipuls wife that touched my heart the most i guess nothing else can ever take away this heartfelt gesture from her
7493061 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7493062 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7493063 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7493064 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7493065 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7493066 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7493067 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7493068 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7493069 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7493070 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7493071 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7493072 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7493073 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7493074 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7493075 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7493076 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7493077 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7493078 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7493079 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7493080 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7493081 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7493082 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7493083 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7493084 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7493085 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7493086 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7493087 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7493088 precisely what would a prudent party member general belief as respects immigration undoubtedly occur
7493089 you can take the hardest rock band on the earth and they sound like a bunch of girls next to the dubliners
7493090 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character
7493091 however jacqueline doesnt want to offend her readers or her readers parents so when the book comes to be reprinted the word will be replaced with twit

7493100 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7493101 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7493102 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7493103 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7493104 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7493105 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

7493107 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7493108 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7493109 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7493110 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

7493115 pan asian dialogue on a cooperation mechanism on security issues
7493116 we need to concentrate on simple and uncomplicated issues for cooperation and focus on cbms that are practical and achievable and at a pace comfortable to all
7493117 cooperative and pluralistic security order in asia based on mutual understanding trust and sovereign equality
7493118 rooted in the realities of asia adding that only by evolving reliable ground rules could cica
7493119 deeper and broader asian cooperation with an emphasis on dialogue holds the key to understanding the full potential of asia for peace and development both in our continent and around the world
7493120 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7493121 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7493122 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7493123 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7493124 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7493125 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7493126 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7493127 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7493128 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7493129 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7493130 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7493131 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7493132 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7493133 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7493134 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7493135 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7493136 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7493137 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7493138 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7493139 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7493140 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7493141 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7493142 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7493143 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7493144 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7493145 following meetings between trafford council and gmpte the council has agreed to postpone business forum meetings that were originally scheduled to begin the first week in september key information relating to how the tif proposals will work in trafford is not currently available and the council wants to ensure businesses who are prepared to give up time to attend the meetings are given relevant and sufficient information discussions about the tif proposals at neighbourhood forums will also be postponed although the meetings themselves will still go ahead as scheduled
7493146 we want to be able to share all the key information about the tif proposals with local people and businesses in trafford before we ask them to make their decision on whether to support the bid
7493147 weve called upon gmpte to provide this information as soon as possible in order to allow them to do this and to make sure we can achieve the best transport system for the borough

7493178 it was a beautiful feeling to score but it did not win us the points
7493179 i would definitely be happier if we had won or if my goal had meant a point for us
7493180 when we played like this in the second division it was mostly us who scored kept the ball and passed it around and we did not lose games like this
7493181 now against everton we played well also kept the ball and it did not seem that they might harm us but then two chances came and two goals from them
7493182 so far nothing has been intense but we know we have to make some points in the next games
7493183 i think we did not play bad in the first games however we did not win any points
7493184 the first game with arsenal okay that does not count but we are sorry for the defeat by everton
7493185 the coach has been relying on a one striker formation but maybe he will be willing to know that we have lost two games with that tactic

7493270 what is more important is to find means by which we can redistribute our economic gains to the benefit of all
7493271 there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
7493272 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development
7493273 certainly there is no limit to taxation if the benefits derived from public services by society measure up to the cost in taxation which they have to pay
7493274 it is a fallacy to say that there is this limit and it is a fallacy to rely mainly on individual free enterprise to get the savings
7493275 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
7493276 we can only compete if our government makes the investments that give us a fighting chance
7493277 and if we know that our families have some net beneath which they cannot fall
7493278 if left to the individual consolidation will take a long time to come we have to look at priorities in terms of what is good for society and on this basis we may find it necessary to force people to do things they would not do otherwise

7493299 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission

7493324 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7493325 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7493326 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7493327 it was obviously due to a circumstance within that country which was certainly out of the control of the local cricket board and i think the whole of the icc really feels for pakistan cricket at the moment
7493328 you couldnt hold a good world event in pakistan at the moment
7493329 it was considered but dismissed very rapidly quite simply because there was no longer sufficient lead time to relocate the event in the same time frame

7493349 the number of white babes interested in at least one meeting with a negro male has been far more than i can handle

7493357 the fight in permatang pauh is no longer about anwar and umno it is no longer about anwar the person but about what he represents a hope that finally raced based policies can be done away with a hope that there would be a better check and balance the lack of which has been the main reasons why corruption and abuses have become so rampant a hope that society would become more open racial polarisation would be less and there would be more accountability and transparency
7493358 it has become the fight for the survival of the still fragile two party system many in civil society believe that everything must be done to nurture it so it will grow stronger and can play the role of an effective watchdog and be a counterbalance to the bn

7493527 because of the expenses involved we came up with the idea of putting one online
7493528 when i did both films they became kind of connected in my mind
7493529 ive always been in love with both stories theyre both about women who come from china to the united states
7493530 it was important to wayne to put them out at the same time but i think its problematic to put two films on the same platform at the same time
7493531 theyre both very avant garde in their thinking in terms of putting things on the internet and making it work
7493532 at the very beginning we intended to go into some other yet to be defined strategy
7493533 the movie was made for not a lot of money truly in the indie spirit
7493534 it was shot with a consumer camera i think its correct for the film to be distributed on the internet for free we can still have a market to make our money back later on television and elsewhere but i like the idea that its readily available for free in the beginning
7493535 ive actually started to look at different things on youtube it opens a whole other world
7493536 part of the point of this is that were trying to work out a paradigm that is filmmaker friendly
7493537 crouch is very tall and very good in the air while defoe is very quick around the area and can cause you lots of problems
7493538 we know what quality they possess but were confident we can deal with it
7493539 we started badly and dropped points at home which isnt what we wanted
7493540 but the season is long and we hope we can get the result we want at portsmouth
7493541 itll be a hard game particularly as portsmouth lost 4 0 to chelsea in their first game and will want to prove something against us to the fans
7493542 we need to get this matter resolved before the transfer deadline
7493543 if berbatov goes we will need time to sign a replacement we want to have the best centre forward we can possibly get

7493549 well see as much as the subprime losses again on the other side at the very least
7493550 the first stage is done were at the second stage the real issue is how much is how much the prime mortgage portfolio is going to be affected that is going to depend on how far house prices will fall
7493551 this is something we dont have a really good handle on i dont think anyone really knows
7493552 the imf figures seem most credible but if you believe others it could be a lot worse
7493553 thus it is still possible to envision a scenario under which the financial system avoids a sharp contraction in the supply of credit although this is significantly less likely now that it was as recently as may
7493554 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they will take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers preserve price stability while supporting growth and continue injecting liquidity as needed by an industry that is still far from having resolved its problems at a time of strong inflationary pressures and tightening credit conditions

7493561 i intend on coming back here someday and living the rest of my days whether its as a player or just somehow maybe involved with the blackhawks
7493562 theyve got a great young nucleus with this team and the management with what theyve done is just tremendous for the fans its been a long time coming since you felt that buzz i cant say i wish i was a part of it right now because im a red wing but its great to see the fans excited about blackhawks hockey

7493570 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7493571 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7493572 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7493573 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7493574 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7493575 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7493576 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself

7493621 i would like to appeal for calm in the sense that a life has been wasted and if there is tension within the community then people need to talk to the police
7493622 we are aware of gang rivalries when there is a shooting in birmingham tensions between gangs do arise and as part of keeping an open mind if this does end up being part of a gang dispute then we would appeal for calm
7493623 we are very much alive to the intelligence that comes from the community itself and we have put extra resources on the ground we have put on high visibility patrols and that does include armed patrols
7493624 this type of crime does remain rare in terms of gun crime in birmingham one murder is one murder too many and we will pull out all the stops to bring this case to a satisfactory conclusion
7493625 our thoughts have to be with his family he was a son a brother and dear friend

7493627 he was lovely funny and gentle i have no idea why somebody would want to do something like this
7493628 he was caring and laid back and he had a very close family he was a family boy the people who have done this can run but they cant hide and hopefully justice will be done

7493656 i dont want to tell people whats right or whats wrong id rather them make their own decision
7493657 i do want to give them the other side of the story first off we dont know what to eat if you do know its really hard to find the right food when you do its costly
7493658 i got really sick i was addicted to food i had diabetes then a friend gave me nutrition and physical degeneration by weston a price and i started getting better i think i would have died if i hadnt picked up that book
7493659 that and to live in the present those are lessons we could all benefit from
7493660 home care is usually best for people with alzheimers but youve got to get outside help a strong support system or youll just burn out
7493661 this is a disease where the more information you have the better equipped you are to deal with it you cant wait until you get to a crisis point
7493662 i guess i was destined to be a helper person or a healer
7493663 ive always enjoyed working with and on behalf of elderly people
7493664 they always have a good story and they have a lot to teach us if were willing to learn
7493665 most doctors dont start people on medications because they like to start medicines
7493666 they have specific reasons and goals for the patient usually when you decide on the medicine it is because you think that is the best for them you always want to give the best to every patient whether they are off the street or a millionaire
7493667 employers are looking for ways to provide their employees with the drugs they need while also keeping an eye on making sure its affordable
7493668 therefore the prescription benefit management services we provide do not interfere with the clinical decisions that may be made by physicians and prescribers
7493669 what happens is you order a drug you feel is best for the patients for multiple reasons and then you get a letter back saying not approved
7493670 many times theres very good reasons why you would stay with the more expensive drugs
7493671 its against the public health and it is crippling office care medicine
7493672 however if the doctor does not then the defendant will simply refuse to fill the patients prescription not much choice to a physician sworn to assist his patients
7493673 the program was voluntary and it really is something that helps address the facts that there are many businesses out there that are telling us they cant afford prescription drugs for their employees
7493674 it comes down to either taking the medicine or not taking the medicine so if i can get it less costly ill get them the 4 generics
7493675 if there are drugs that cant be gotten that way then those are the ones they submit to medicare
7493676 doctors get so beat down that they convince themselves that they arent hurting the patients
7493677 they arent fighting the fight because they feel theyve done all they can do they feel defeated
7493678 thats what makes me lie awake at night the fact that i cant help these people but i can
7493679 every day that i cant get them their medication im hurting them

7493695 micah was a little bit groggy obviously but the paramedics did their job there are always concerns when you see incidents like this they stabilised him and got him off the pitch
7493696 they did all the correct things and by all accounts he was lucid in the tunnel i do not think there is any concern regarding a neck injury it is more he has a bang on his head
7493697 it is always nice to play well in front of the owner of the club it does help i spoke to him earlier in the week and i was really excited by what he had to say i am sure he enjoyed the game
7493698 this was a big win for us irrespective of west ham going down to ten men so early i felt we were in control there was a real determination in our play and a willingness to ask questions of the opposition
7493699 it was a good all round performance and once we got our noses in front there was only going to be one winner
7493700 i do not think any one of my players can hold their hands up and say they performed given the personnel we have available i do not think we were equipped to play with ten men
7493701 we needed to defend in the second half with our lives and the first goal is always important it was a poor clearance and the boy sturridge has finished it well and it was back to the wall after that

7493714 seeking damages for harm she allegedly sustained as a result of her consumption of methylmercury and other harmful compounds contained in tuna fish products
7493715 failure to warn of the risks incurred in consuming its products
7493716 failure to warn consumers that their tuna products contain dangerous mercury compounds
7493717 are preempted by the fdas regulatory approach to the risks posed by mercury compounds in tuna fish
7493718 t he sole question presented in this appeal is whether plaintiffs state claim for damages is preempted by federal law
7493719 1 that the fda has adopted a pervasive regulatory approach embodied in the fdas advisory backgrounder and internal enforcement guideline with which fellners state lawsuit actually conflicts 2 that the fda has reject ed the use of warning labels in favor of a more nuanced approach that is that the fda has reached a decision that warnings should not be regulated a decision which preempts the state from entertaining a claim based on a duty to warn theory and 3 that the fda would have rejected any warning as misbranding a determination which preempts fellners failure to warn claim
7493720 i f preemption exists in this case it must be conflict preemption
7493721 it is hard to imagine a field more squarely within the realm of traditional state regulation than a state tort like action seeking damages for an alleged failure to warn consumers of dangers arising from the use of a product
7493722 the fda has regulated neither the risk of mercury in tuna nor the permissible warnings regarding that risk in a manner that conflicts with the class action lawsuit

7493914 i was very surprised at the pace in this heat it was unreal that they ran the first 10km in under 30 minutes
7493915 the pace was too hot i tried to stick with the front guys but i couldnt
7493916 the effect of the judgment is to exclude an entire industry from the protections of the machinery of the labour act and the constitution
7493917 on a practical level should applicant be correct that the sex workers are entitled to approach the labour court machinery for protection this will serve immediately to ameliorate at least to some extent the harsh circumstances in which many sex workers find themselves and deter employers from acting with impunity
7493918 sex workers have a constitutional and statutory right to protection against unfair labour practices generally and unfair dismissals in particular it is not open to the courts to deprive them of the protection which the constitution and parliament intended them to have
7493919 it is perfectly possible to uphold both statutes alongside one another where the sexual offences act seeks to eradicate or limit the prevalence of prostitution by criminal sanction the labour relations act on the other hand recognises that sex workers are also employees and for as long as they are they are entitled to the constitutional and statutory protection afforded to all employees regardless of the work they do
7493920 yes it is the second time from the last two races so we have to understand and analyse and solve the problem for sure

7493923 ive been in discussions with the rfu aimed at growing the game not just at regional level but at premiership level too for a number of months

7493925 these proposals will create exciting competition which the game needs and will also bring additional money to replace the edf energy cup
7493926 i am very happy because we got an agreement with the people from the club
7493927 i was also trying to push it so we could get the deal done because people were talking too much about situations which werent really there
7493928 so i think that starting this week we can have an easy week now in training and just concentrate on each game
7493929 i also think that the people at the club can now relax they are making jokes already
7493930 it is going to be very positive to the mentality of the team and that is why it is important
7493931 i think it is great news for the fans but also for the players the gaffer and for me it wasnt a good thing to get phone calls every day asking me what is happening
7493932 so for me it is very important that it is all done and now i can just focus now on blackburn and football im 100 percent a blackburn player and i will keep working hard

7493951 there is an urgent need to mobilise people who can help and work out simple solutions for those who need them
7493952 the only way to achieve this is to get real commitment from government a commitment that is above politics and above party lines
7493953 the most necessary message of all and one that needs to go out to every single settlement every municipality and every person rich and poor is that certain things in life are beyond politics environmental and health rights are common to all of humanity
7493954 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7493955 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7493956 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7493957 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7493958 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7493959 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7493960 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7493961 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal

7493963 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community

7493966 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7493967 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7493968 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7493969 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7493970 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7493971 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7493972 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

7493974 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7493975 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7493976 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

7493978 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7493979 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7493980 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7493981 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7493982 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7493983 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7493984 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7493985 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7493986 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7493987 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7493988 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7493989 violated the law as they crossed the line of giving instructions putting an excessive psychological burden on him judge koji maki said
7493990 inappropriate words but said that such treatment by supervisors was unavoidable
7493991 more officers of the self defence forces are committing suicide the officers mother told a meeting of supporters after the verdict as quoted by
7493992 if the self defence forces had given consideration to what the problem was without trying to cover things up this lawsuit would have ended sooner she said
7493993 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7493994 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7493995 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7493996 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7493997 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7493998 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7493999 this is a planning took where all things are going

7494002 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7494003 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7494004 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7494005 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

7494008 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7494009 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7494010 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7494011 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7494012 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7494013 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7494014 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7494015 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7494016 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7494017 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

7494043 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7494044 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons

7494066 he who does not know how to put his thoughts on ice ought not to enter into the heat of battle
7494067 if we live together with another person too closely what happens is similar to when we repeatedly handle a good engraving with our bare hands one day all we have left is a piece of dirty paper the soul of a human being too can finally become tattered by being handled continually and that is how it finally appears to us we never see the beauty of its original design again

7494069 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7494070 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7494071 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7494072 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7494073 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7494074 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7494075 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7494076 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7494077 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7494078 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7494079 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7494080 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7494081 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7494082 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7494083 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7494084 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7494085 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7494086 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7494087 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7494088 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7494089 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7494090 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7494091 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

7494358 superstar david beckham kicked off the countdown to the london olympics and revealed he could be a coach for team gb in 2012 becks sent 91 000 spectators into a frenzy at beijings national stadium when he appeared from within a red london bus at yesterdays closing ceremony
7494359 rania wannous spokeswoman for visit london said the issue has been
7494360 this is a three minute film that is a few years old it has been used at many events before and we have never had any complaints
7494361 reinforcing what everyone thinks they know about the place this was brand marketing at its most effective
7494362 johnson amp johnson has been waiting until after the beijing games close today before making a statement when it is expected to say that it is cutting its involvement lenovo the chinese computer company like manulife sees no gain from a link with the london games kodak has been involved with the olympics since their revival in 1896 but its chief executive antonio perez said its sponsorship was no longer the best use of the companys money
7494363 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7494364 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7494365 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7494366 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7494367 the criminal cases review commission recommended that his case go back to the court of appeal which this summer cleared him
7494368 aided and abetted by secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
7494369 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7494370 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7494371 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7494372 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7494373 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too
7494374 the psni as a political statement and thus they judge the psnis success not by its effectiveness but by its existence and that sad to say makes the psni the latest in a long line of political police forces here
7494375 i talked to mr blatter about how we could find a solution to this and i am confident fifa will give the assurances that the scottish welsh and irish associations want
7494376 i am also confident that when the people of scotland wales and
7494377 we all want to see a great britain football team its the right thing to do to have a successful olympics
7494378 gordon smith the sfas chief executive has spoken to the prime minister about team gb but we are unlikely to alter our position and remain opposed to the concept of a great britain football team
7494379 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk
7494380 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
7494381 all we can hope is that wherever he ends up he will be locked away until he ceases to be a threat to children
7494382 you might think if you were attempting to define public service broadcasting for this modern competitive age that your very starting point would be what can we do to help ensure the continuing breadth of tvs appeal
7494383 with no money to spend they see tv as the primary form of entertainment
7494384 the research found one group of 12 people sharing a house who all congregate around the tv
7494385 london still has to deliver as well as china with regard to the quality of the olympic village venues and transport the games are for the athletes the games are not for london the games are not for great britain
7494386 as the beijing mayor guo jinlong passes the flag to boris johnson the greenwich pips will herald the start of the london section of the show followed quickly by a rendition of the national anthem including unusually its second verse performed by 25 children from the national youth theatre
7494387 no plot was in place but there were calls for the death of gordon brown on an extremist jihad website in january
7494388 senior irish and british officials currently sound like prophets of doom
7494389 the bottomless pit of enmity and the cavernous morass of malice that i bear towards our wee pravince has not by this time articulated itself to everyone who knows me

7494391 under the new pension credit scheme the department for work and pensions dwp admits that low earners will see their retirement income increased by only 1 per cent of their salary or 2 a week after 10 years saving in the governments flagship new pension scheme to be launched in 2012 because their savings are eaten away by means testing even someone earning 25 000 a year who contributes to the new personal accounts for 20 years will only see their income in retirement increased from 31 per cent of salary to 34 per cent experts say the figures highlight the way pension credit the means tested benefit paid to pensioners with small pensions reduces the incentive for many people to save
7494392 the imaginary time bomb why an ageing population is not a social problem
7494393 historically modern societies double their wealth about every twenty five years this kind of growth projected across the next half century would dwarf the extra pension and other costs to society of more elderly dependents moreover it is far from certain that extra years of life mean extra years of ill health and dependency serious disease tends to be concentrated towards the end of life so living longer may simply postpone the point of onset without increasing the costs
7494394 well be asking two dublin legends where it all went wrong
7494395 west belfasts paddy barnes guaranteed himself a bronze medal after his quarter final triumph in the light flyweight division he now faces chinas zou shiming a home grown favourite and a man who beat paddy in the world championships last year so no surprise to see paddy power offering 9 1 about barnes taking gold and 7 2 to clinch a silver

7494398 i just happen to be an associate superintendent over 20 years in education and i still get excited about the first day of school i dont think ill ever get over that
7494399 coming to dayton felt like coming home i was raised in rural maryland in a similar culture close community
7494400 i feel fortunate and blessed to work with such a great team with richard stokes at the helm
7494401 former superintendent mary pierczynski has been a great mentor along with fellow associate superintendent sue keema were able to collaborate and figure out whats best for kids
7494402 its a great lifestyle with tahoe a half hour away

7494408 we expect that the points that have been agreed to but not yet met will be fulfilled in the next few days
7494409 there has been less rain less water standing and less heat so the mosquitoes have not found a conducive atmosphere to breed
7494410 the numbers may increase as this is just the start of the season
7494411 the chances of infection spreading are more because of this
7494412 ramadan will provide an opportunity for the spread of the disease if we do not take measures now
7494413 because many will use the mosque pond for ablutions and those fasting will also be drinking more water the message that water needs to be covered has to be repeated often
7494414 when they brought him here his platelet count had gone down to 26 000
7494415 but after supportive therapy that included injecting fluids intravenously to prevent dehydration and a lot of rest his platelet count increased to 70 000 and his fever has also gone down
7494416 dengue is a self limiting disease in 80 percent of cases people do not develop any symptoms even for those who develop haemorrhagic fever it is curable if people come for treatment at an early stage and dont wait till they are on their death bed
7494417 if the platelet count is monitored and the patient transfused in very dire cases then there is little to worry about
7494418 because of pre existing problems especially if a person is suffering from other chronic or debilitating diseases
7494419 apart from four general wards that can accommodate dengue patients we have 250 medicated mosquito nets and a ward exclusively for dengue patients if there is an outbreak
7494420 we never think of earthquakes like we do floods or cyclones whenever a jolt occurs in the country we panic and after a while we forget the most disastrous calamity
7494421 unplanned urbanisation overpopulation poorly constructed structures lack of coordination between institutions concerned inadequacy of recovery tools and lack of awareness among the people place the country at high risk
7494422 a relatively long period of rest from any major seismic activity and high attention paid to other disasters such as cyclones and floods have led to a neglect of disaster preparedness for earthquakes the most destructive of all natural disasters
7494423 most of the buildings in major cities are built without following the building codes
7494424 we want to make the fire service more alert more able to respond we are equipping them in a modern way
7494425 so mr wensley im afraid theres nothing i can do i do have this letter for you of course
7494426 apparently you father built on land that didnt belong to him and the city is claiming possession of the estate
7494427 this doesnt make any sense how would he have been allowed to build there in the first place
7494428 no one is allowed onto the property youll have to take it up with the housing authority downtown
7494429 i am very happy because we got an agreement with the people from the club
7494430 i was also trying to push it so we could get the deal done because people were talking too much about situations which werent really there
7494431 so i think that starting this week we can have an easy week now in training and just concentrate on each game
7494432 i also think that the people at the club can now relax they are making jokes already
7494433 it is going to be very positive to the mentality of the team and that is why it is important
7494434 i think it is great news for the fans but also for the players the gaffer and for me it wasnt a good thing to get phone calls every day asking me what is happening
7494435 so for me it is very important that it is all done and now i can just focus now on blackburn and football im 100 percent a blackburn player and i will keep working hard
7494436 ive been in discussions with the rfu aimed at growing the game not just at regional level but at premiership level too for a number of months
7494437 there are clear implications for the premiership and i will be holding discussions with those clubs in a couple of weeks time
7494438 these proposals will create exciting competition which the game needs and will also bring additional money to replace the edf energy cup
7494439 yes it is the second time from the last two races so we have to understand and analyse and solve the problem for sure
7494440 he did everything perfect no mistake at all the car pace was very good it was fantastic really
7494441 in qualifying kimi didnt make the perfect lap so he lost two tenths during the race his target was to jump heikki kovalainen and he was close to doing that but then he had a problem with the pit stop
7494442 as far as were concerned the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia cannot be called into question and the resolution of the federation council contradicts the principle of territorial integrity
7494443 in this sense it is a decision that is not aimed at calming the situation or reducing tensions therefore we expect that neither the russian government nor the president will follow the advice of the federation council
7494444 this is a message of defiance to the international community we call on the unamid peacekeepers to do their job and defend the idps internally displaced persons
7494445 i am inside the camp kalma now there is still shooting

7494456 i was called to the post with a short notice and i would like to discuss the matter with the mayor chairman of the city council the ceo of or and the board before i say anything about which policy and what emphasis i prefer
7494457 i am extremely proud this achievement was no coincidence we have shown it in many games what we are made of we didnt get the gold but we won silver at the olympics and to achieve that many things have to work out
7494458 we appear to have practiced the right things in the time that we had for practicing the team was in a great physical condition and the mental condition was in order
7494459 like the game developed we did not play well enough in the final we blew too many good chances the latter half was even but we let them get too far ahead in the first half the french defense is strong but despite that we created many chances that we unfortunately didnt take advantage of
7494460 we realized that the first 15 minutes of the final would be the most important if we would not manage to keep the icelanders at bay during the first quarter they might get the lead in the game and then we would have been in serious trouble
7494461 i shed a tear it was the biggest moment in icelandic handball history
7494462 we feel the support which we have received from all directions and especially from iceland it is invaluable to sense that and i dont know how to describe how i feel amazingly and at the same time i am grateful for the support we have enjoyed
7494463 it is the largest sports event that has ever been held and the greatest olympic games to date no question about it but i did not have a chance to enjoy these games it has been work non stop
7494464 i have always had the opinion that the area where the airport is currently located is the best construction area in
7494465 this idea that the airport is not supposed to be there definitely requires more support
7494466 we will continue development near vatnsm rin based on the winning idea of the architecture competition which we organized earlier this term
7494467 i want to see the school at that place on laugavegur as originally planned
7494468 no me sorprende que lo hayan hecho ya hemos visto a los espa oles antes ser muy agresivos en ese sentido
7494469 les hemos dado una paliza en el agua y ahora hacen todo lo que pueden para encontrar una formalidad que les permita ganar una medalla o subir un puesto
7494470 era f sicamente imposible recurrir a la t ctica los espa oles disparan con p lvora mojada hacen una monta a de una estupidez esto no tiene nada que ver con lo estrictamente deportivo pero ahora estoy mucho m s seguro que hace dos d as de que el oro es nuestro lo contrario me sorprender a
7494471 da igual lo que hagan y digan nos hemos permitido el lujo de llegar tarde a la salida y hemos entrado en el puesto exacto para ser medalla de oro

7494477 mr rich now has a legal hammer to use in the event a certain line is crossed by those individuals who are attacking him
7494478 the law says what hes doing is legal and now the individual responsible for enforcing the law says what hes doing is legal without question this makes it a lot riskier for people to try to criminalize his contributions to different candidates

7494480 i originally produced the work for my own needs as a personal attempt to unravel what had become an ontological knot due to the many symbolic layers that had mixed themselves in with an extremely violent act

7494484 yah this has obviously become more about the artist and the wtc than space invaders way to steal the thunder from the game itself jerk

7494497 a certain discount is justified given the more favourable emerging market profile of other brewers
7494498 a 10 per cent discount to the sector seems more justified than the current 20 per cent
7494499 the key strength for heineken is the well known premium status of its global brand
7494500 the success of imported beer stems from consumer attraction to new products but also from immigration and foreign travel however imported beer does not seem to be attracting new consumers to the market rather it is cannibalizing domestic brands
7494501 the consumer compensation program established in this program is unworkable unfair and unacceptable to consumers
7494502 it provides only a fraction of the funds needed to compensate consumers for the costs of a digital transition they never asked for
7494503 it comprises frequencies that lend themselves to next generation broadband services such as wimax a lot of people are going to be affected by this including the average consumer who does not have a clue that this is going on
7494504 consumers will have no idea whats coming and what they need to do to prepare for it making it likely that tens of millions of televisions sets will go black on february 17 2009
7494505 and by requiring consumers to jump through restrictive hoops to request vouchers those who most need compensation will be the least likely to receive it

7494512 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
7494513 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7494514 i dont think you would find anybody in the who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7494515 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him

7494541 today we must fulfill what is i think our historic mission to defend small countries from aggressors
7494542 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7494543 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7494544 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7494545 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7494546 and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7494547 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7494548 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations
7494549 the government is committed to tackling gun gang and knife crime and getting weapons off our streets
7494550 in july we launched the 100m youth crime action plan which sets out a comprehensive package of tough enforcement and intensive prevention measures as well as more support for parents to tackle offending and reduce reoffending
7494551 as a result of the shooting the home office was jumping up and down last august
7494552 the question was asked at the time of the home secretary why it was we didnt see the same frenetic activity from the government and the media when the black youths were murdered and yet when the white youngster was killed everybody stood to attention
7494553 frankly what derrick says is an insult to black groups and other community groups up and down the country who are being funded by local and central government and work in this area on a daily and regular basis
7494554 i do need to knock down the notion that somehow there is a national conspiracy of at best indifference and at worst active policy that says somehow the death of young black men on our streets doesnt matter
7494555 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7494556 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens

7494565 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7494566 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7494567 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7494568 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7494569 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7494570 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7494571 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out
7494572 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7494573 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7494574 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7494575 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7494576 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7494577 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7494578 i dont see the same kind of life we have had and we better get it back
7494579 i dont know if they are just playing out the string or what but we have to play better before the playoffs begin
7494580 they may not look like a good team in the standings but they play us well
7494581 our pitchers need to do a better job the rest of the way for most of these guys it is their first full season and we are keeping an eye on it but we need to have them do well going into the playoffs
7494582 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities

7494604 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7494605 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7494606 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7494607 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7494608 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox

7494614 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7494615 the mayor is deeply concerned by the realisation that a shot of myra hindley was shown in a short video at london house and asked that it not be shown again
7494616 british art definitely represents some of the best of british but of all the many masterpieces that could have been used this was the most regrettable and the least inspired choice
7494617 it is a total disgrace this proud night for britain has been sullied by this grotesque representation of london clearly whoever was responsible must be found and fired immediately
7494618 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7494619 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect harveys portrait called myra has caused controversy since he unveiled it in 1995
7494620 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7494621 and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7494622 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7494623 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations
7494624 the government is committed to tackling gun gang and knife crime and getting weapons off our streets
7494625 in july we launched the 100m youth crime action plan which sets out a comprehensive package of tough enforcement and intensive prevention measures as well as more support for parents to tackle offending and reduce reoffending
7494626 as a result of the shooting the home office was jumping up and down last august
7494627 the question was asked at the time of the home secretary why it was we didnt see the same frenetic activity from the government and the media when the black youths were murdered and yet when the white youngster was killed everybody stood to attention
7494628 frankly what derrick says is an insult to black groups and other community groups up and down the country who are being funded by local and central government and work in this area on a daily and regular basis
7494629 i do need to knock down the notion that somehow there is a national conspiracy of at best indifference and at worst active policy that says somehow the death of young black men on our streets doesnt matter

7494741 we felt these posters were the ideal way to advertise the exhibit as they give people an idea of what they can expect at the dungeon and we wouldnt want anyone who was maybe a bit squeamish to be shocked or upset when they visited the dungeon
7494742 we can appreciate that some people may have found the images too strong however and when we were contacted by the asa it said we should either edit the posters or take them down
7494743 we decided to alter them and hopefully this is an acceptable compromise although it is a bit of a shame for william wallace as he has lost his limbs again
7494744 the general nature of the complaints was that some people had found the posters to be disturbing offensive and unsuitable particularly when they had been put up in an area where they would be seen by the general public
7494745 potentially significant implications for schools and services to vulnerable children
7494746 edinburgh has unique problems it has a drug culture deeply embedded in society and there are currently around 6000 drug addicts registered in the city
7494747 social workers and health visitors report a growing number of parents involved in some form of substance misuse and this partly accounts for the dramatic increase in child protection referrals over the last four years
7494748 this february when we were setting the budget the councils administration told us that everything was now under control
7494749 three months into the financial year we find out this is not the case
7494750 it is deeply worrying that they have this projected overspend
7494751 vulnerable children requiring care is not a new issue and the department has to get better at predicting what levels are going to be required to meet these pressures
7494752 the department still faces enormous budget pressures in many areas the largest of these is due to the increasing demand for frontline services particularly those related to vulnerable children
7494753 it is crucial that we find more local foster carers to deal with this increase in demand the only alternative is to place children with other authorities or the independent sector which is very costly
7494754 a couple of other robert forrest statues have gone up for sale over the years but this is the most significant by some way its very dynamic and very robustly carved its a really impressive carving and it has big commercial appeal
7494755 i think a better place could be found for it than its existing location
7494756 for example possibly a financial institution could buy it there are obviously lots of developments in the fountainbridge area of the city and that might be a solution or perhaps a private buyer who would be prepared to offer access where the public can go along on certain days of the year to view it
7494757 the building were in just now is a beautiful old farm steading but it is not very flexible or conducive to the needs of a modern office
7494758 the new building is much more flexible and meets the needs of an office environment
7494759 we did search in edinburgh for two or two and a half years but could not quite get what we wanted
7494760 we started looking in an area within ten miles of where we are now but when we could not find exactly what we were looking for we extended the search perimeter
7494761 the site was carefully selected we need to be near a main road network
7494762 the new building will be yards from the motorway and access to edinburgh will be very easy
7494763 were obviously looking to get the most out of edinburgh being busy just now
7494764 the last two years it has coincided with the tartan week in edinburgh but we thought wed take advantage of the city being full
7494765 it means that we can get bands along in the fine weather and make it just a really special event
7494766 there are two reasons its important for us its an important fundraiser but its also a good spectacle to raise awareness of the rock trust and the work that we do
7494767 we saw it advertised and thought we should do it its a good cause i used to work in the shelter shop so i always try and support the homeless
7494768 its something different something special and i work with children and adults with disabilities and people that cant really manage so ive got an interest in just helping with that its quite different from any other charity walk
7494769 at the time it was released in the us there were a few screenings where it had subtitles
7494770 i thought that was a bit unfair i last saw the film 15 years ago and i still think its a great movie
7494771 it was shot in black and white so you can have half your money back
7494772 i took the part really to do something different from bond and it was a very complicated film
7494773 the only reservation i had was whether an american director would be able to handle the disciplines of the british in the army i was delighted to find that sidney lumet the director could and i have made five films with him which is the longest relationship ive ever had with a director
7494774 taking orders from someone you genuinely feel is an idiot is very difficult
7494775 we are getting so many mixed messages from iraq and afghanistan and it seems to be the exact same situation as when britain fought there in the 1800s
7494776 i submitted planning permission two weeks ago to turn the house into a bed and breakfast for a temporary period of five years
7494777 for the building to remain empty for any length of time just encourages vandals
7494778 to get it open and get some employment in the area would be a good thing
7494779 it will be aimed at the east lothian tourist trade
7494780 i have never run a b amp b before but i have looked after 70 old people its a completely different type of client but its still looking after people
7494781 im obviously very sorry that the home has closed however the owners have got to find some use for this sorry building and i imagine most of the community will be glad to see it being used for something
7494782 these guys are playing in shifts it can often be four hours of incessant lone piping so i can see how it could get on peoples nerves
7494783 other pipers can take in over 100 a time which is quite a bit of cash so i dont think paying some money for a licence would be out of the question
7494784 the performers are representing the city and representing the image of the highland soldier and as such they have to be smart and presentable but at the moment anyone is allowed to play
7494785 the bagpiper player in full highland dress is one of scotlands most iconic images
7494786 pipe major iain grant was the perfect role model for our new tv advert given his long association with the railway particularly the east coast route
7494787 he is a well known popular character and represents everything that is traditional yet fun about scotland making it such an interesting destination to visit by train
7494788 we have recently met up with director of education gillian tee and education leader marilyne maclaren and both meetings have been successful
7494789 im excited about our plans and want to put people in tune with what we are thinking and hopefully they will join in im still very confident that we will not close
7494790 i will be going along to the meetings but everyone is expecting the school to close
7494791 this means many of our pupils are being taught in buildings which are expensive to run as they are too big for the number of pupils
7494792 it is important that we use our resources wisely to allow us to give all pupils a quality education in schools fit for the 21st century
7494793 no decisions have been made and we are now consulting with parents and stakeholders to listen to their views on the proposals
7494794 the area around salamander street has in the recent past been the subject of a great deal of debate on the issue of prostitution
7494795 surely there is an opportunity here for the city to revisit this issue with consideration given to the creation of a tolerance zone this would demonstrate an enlightened approach and would address important issues before they inevitably arise
7494796 i think that as an act of generosity the director of the cockburn association moira tasker should propose a tolerance zone outside her own house
7494797 the people of leith are sick and tired of people belonging to organisations like this who invariably live in places like stockbridge and morningside proposing once again that we dump all the social problems on leithers
7494798 we have almost eradicated this problem it seems this organisation hasnt looked at the history and the battle the community has fought to liberate the streets for local women they should stick to what they do best and not engage in matters they know nothing whatsoever about
7494799 this is the law and we have to work within it whatever its limitations most laws could always do with some fine tuning to improve upon them
7494800 from a legal and enforcement perspective a tolerance zone is not possible theres also a community safety partnership approach we have adopted to encourage routes out of prostitution

7494818 but i will live just to see my daughter have a good future
7494819 everyone said that i was involved with the love affair
7494820 it has not been easy with this life to live until today i attempted to kill my self several times as my beauty was gone
7494821 since acid burned my face i went out covering my face and head no one could see my face
7494822 i lost my beauty and carried aids at the same time
7494823 i am afraid of death now but i must survive
7494824 it is a cruel act to take revenge with acid
7494825 my mother died after an acid attack in 2002 when a lady got jealous about her husband
7494826 my mother did not love this other ladys husband she was just a good neighbour
7494827 now i have a new life at casc and i have to struggle and forget the past
7494828 im not depressed at all right now ive gained confidence and continue to live
7494829 many survivors are anxious depressed scared they feel revenge of other people they hate themselves because it affects them physically their sense of self is gone it is a long journey for them to get self esteem and confidence back
7494830 we cant get a figure on the number of acid attack each year as there is no report from hospitals or other clinics

7494839 so are the opportunities for electronics makers content providers and consumers to get connected
7494840 consumers really arent driving the trend toward networked devices the device makers are
7494841 the companies are pushing this to try to build a new business to offer new services it is really a matter of getting the infrastructure in place
7494842 what this means for consumers is that some people may bring products home and discover that they cant communicate with others on their networks
7494843 we are just starting to see the first networked products roll out and a shakeout in standards is inevitable

7494853 cao is a good sensitive and energetic student in class shes also good at writing and singing and has a good relationship with her classmates shes a role model with her eagerness to learn and overcome difficulties not just for ethnic minority students but everyone in the class
7494854 we highly appreciate the great effort it must take for cao to not just attend school but also excel
7494855 about 90 per cent of our students in the mountainous school are members of ethnic minorities around here working to prevent hunger and poverty is often considered far more important than an education the rainy season which lasts one or two months always results in many students dropping out even though textbooks and school fees are free

7494967 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7494968 if i were in the obama camp i would lock
7494969 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7494970 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7494971 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7494972 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7494973 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year

7494975 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us

7495011 the concept of national sovereignty has been an immutable indeed sacred principle of international relations it is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation it is simply not feasible for sovereignty to be exercised unilaterally by individual nation states however powerful the global community must be assured of environmental security
7495012 it is the responsibility of each human being today to choose between the force of darkness and the force of light we must therefore transform our attitudes and adopt a renewed respect for the
7495013 current lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent middle class involving high meat intake use of fossil fuels appliances air conditioning and suburban housing are not sustainable a shift is necessary which will require a vast strengthening of the multilateral system including the united nations

7495041 as a country were still looking at relatively small numbers but the incubation period the time from when you are exposed to when you get sick can vary from as small as three days to over two months
7495042 being able to recognize it and then do things to limit that impact thats really where the system can kick in
7495043 these products have been distributed nationally to retail stores and food service institutions such as restaurants hospitals nursing homes and other institutional cafeterias or kitchens

7495045 results of genetic testing from three samples of the products recalled by maple leaf foods show that two tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria

7495055 there is no other way for abkhazia and south ossetia we will never go back to the past
7495056 we need to get this matter resolved before the transfer deadline
7495057 if berbatov goes we will need time to sign a replacement we want to have the best centre forward we can possibly get
7495058 we have started badly but it is a long season and we have plenty of time to put it right
7495059 it will not be easy tonight portsmouth will want to show they are not as bad as they looked last week but we will be ready

7495063 beim h ndewaschen muss die waschlotion bis zu den ellenbogen zwei minuten einwirken
7495064 we asked the players at the start of the season was the hunger still there because until st patricks weekend last year you could argue we were the best team in the league
7495065 from march until the end of the season we couldnt buy a win so weve asked them if the hunger and desire is still there and i think that showed today
7495066 we have barry and mark holland declan ohara and barry johnston to come back in vincent sweeneys on his way back so we have a lot of options
7495067 but with big squads comes big decisions and you have to try and keep everybody happy but if youre winning every week they will be
7495068 normally we have to score precise and exciting goals but i think all five were goalscorers goals where we normally dont get a lot of people into the box to score those type of goals
7495069 chris is an honest as the day is long hell run all day and do a lot of donkey work outside the box to create space for others but he got three goals and fully deserved them and long may it continue
7495070 it showed up a lot of deficiencies with individuals in a particular area where i felt we were fairly solid in
7495071 i had a good word with them nice and quietly behind closed doors and asked them to go and have an introspective look at themselves and then come back and tell me how much better they could have done
7495072 we missed him last week when he had a little injury and i think he was only really playing at 70
7495073 he gave a class performance in there we knew what we were getting when we brought him here he got 16 goals last year and hes up and running with two already
7495074 he has fitted in really well hes a good lad as well which is important and i was very pleased with his performance i thought he was excellent
7495075 we targeted those players we looked at areas where i felt we needed to strengthen
7495076 if you are going to compete in the top half dozen teams in this league you need to have some quality players in your team to try to stay there
7495077 in black gareth mckeown and mark dickson we have three top quality irish league footballers mark dickson was outstanding his work rate was immense he held the ball up well laid the ball off well and was unlucky not to have a couple of goals himself
7495078 i needed to win this game to get off to a good start ive got my first round points and hopefully i can get some more to help push me up the rankings rather than the wrong way down
7495079 i want to do well in every tournament but the main aim is to get back into the top 16 again so i dont have to go to the qualifiers
7495080 i initially thought he might be ready but he said to me that the prognosis is different and that he will not return for the northern ireland game
7495081 he might possibly play for the international team in october
7495082 three minutes into the second half nobody would have predicted that result
7495083 the first goal gave us a bit of heart and then we showed a lot of character and fight to get two more goals to win the game which i think in the end we deserved
7495084 i am very proud of the players for what they achieved weve had a couple of games now and we are starting to defend better and get a bit of shape about ourselves which is good
7495085 i said from day one that we needed to show character this season and i like that in my teams anyway
7495086 if we can display that quality throughout the season then staying out of the bottom two which is our ultimate aim shouldnt be a problem
7495087 glenavon will be looking for their first points and we know that we have to be on our game for that one
7495088 marks worked hard to come back and his arrival in the second half made a huge difference for us
7495089 he is well behind the rest of the squad in terms of fitness but he has worked hard and having him around again is a massive plus for us
7495090 the bottom line is that goals win matches its that simple we created enough chances to have been comfortable winners but the fact is we didnt put even one of them away
7495091 we were caught by an early sucker punch and got stronger as the game went on but for all the work we put in we came away with nothing we must learn from that
7495092 we needed a second goal to kill off the game but it didnt come in the end one goal was enough and now we move on
7495093 we have to build on this result and try to get something at the riverside institute will be hurting after throwing away a two goal lead and losing at bangor
7495094 i scored with my second touch i might as well have come off after that i was totally knackered after my celebration
7495095 six years ago linfield came in for me i was about 26 and thought i was heading for windsor but it ended up that the blues signed wee mark picking instead
7495096 back then mark was at coleraine who were in the premier league and i was at distillery in the first division that was probably the only difference
7495097 i thought it would happen back then but it didnt but it is never too late as the saying goes
7495098 the lads have been brilliant they have made me feel great it hasnt been hard settling in at all
7495099 the standards are still there even though they have won so many trophies every season the hunger is there match after match trophy after trophy there is no other team i have been at who can do that who can keep winning silverware and still have the desire
7495100 you come into the team and you see the desire form the word go thats good to see and it runs right through the staff to the kit manager to the players
7495101 ive admired john as a person and as a player for many years and we almost signed him a few years back
7495102 but when the opportunity arose this time i was determined to make sure he would finally become a linfield player
7495103 he never gave up hope of moving here but when we spoke to him in the summer i put it to him that for all his ability hed never won major honours in the game and challenged him to come here and do that
7495104 we continue to look and if a loan deal was right for a player across the water then we would look at it but they would have to really want to come to the club i wont even think about a loan deal for a player in the irish league but if we had to go to january with what i have id still be happy with that

7495157 zanu pf are in a desperate attempt to try and stop or abort our victory
7495158 its true in london and in the big cities of the north it is connected to the new poverty
7495159 england is one of the richest countries in the world the people im talking about have enormous televisions a lot bigger than my own the latest in mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend
7495160 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
7495161 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male if i come across any that say they want to enter tv i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7495162 he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bloody day
7495163 he talks about middle class white men being a beleaguered species on tv well excuse me but look at jonathan ross jeremy on newsnight the today programme have i got news for you
7495164 theres a jeremy paxman esque malaise among male viewers who feel they havent anywhere else to go
7495165 we have to think about the patient and not be dogmatic about it
7495166 and thats the problem in canada were very dogmatic about public and private and you know this public and private system exists everywhere in the world except three countries canada cuba and north korea
7495167 for example a surgeon could do 90 per cent of his surgery in the public system but if theres no operating room available then he could do maybe five or 10 per cent of his practice in the private sector
7495168 but then you dont need to lose that surgeon in the public sector because hes doing a small part of his practice in the private sector
7495169 as a country were still looking at relatively small numbers but the incubation period the time from when you are exposed to when you get sick can vary from as small as three days to over two months
7495170 being able to recognize it and then do things to limit that impact thats really where the system can kick in
7495171 these products have been distributed nationally to retail stores and food service institutions such as restaurants hospitals nursing homes and other institutional cafeterias or kitchens
7495172 these products may also be sold at deli counters if the original product identity and best before code is not evident consumers are advised to check with their retailer to determine if the product is included in the list of recalled products

7495176 yes he will have to fear that clinton voters will refuse to go to the polls for him but it is more important not to be seen as a candidate who is being led around by the nose by the clintons joe biden is a good vice presidential choice unlike obama he brings foreign policy experience to the ticket raised in a working class family he speaks to voter constituencies which tend to be critical of obama who is seen as elite

7495182 this is not something colorado needs its not worker driven
7495183 it creates a business and living environment that appreciates different points of view and has a degree of tolerance that makes for a good business climate
7495184 it just should have all gone away we have too many more important issues to deal with in society than fight a national battle on the plains on colorado
7495185 we feel there is a racial component for some union members
7495186 there has never been an african american candidate for president and many folks around this country have never voted for an african american candidate for any office
7495187 weve had a lot of discussions about how to talk to union voters to identify closely what issue is preventing some union voters
7495188 our goal is not just to elect barack obama but to build a progressive movement
7495189 our goal is to have the same number of people on the ground and the same level of activity
7495190 were not going to be a lapdog but a watchdog
7495191 this race is still too tight and many of our members are for this guy mccain
7495192 its too close weve got to fight like hell we even have to fight with some of our own members
7495193 people want change and we are going to do everything within our power to make that happen
7495194 brothers and sisters we have to turn around america if we have four more years of george bush and john mccain america wont have a prayer
7495195 my father is waiting to go back to work this fall to continue to be the voice of americas workers in the united states senate
7495196 we were already fired up but it was nice to hear our leaders articulate our matters in a serious way
7495197 if we dont elect obama the labor movement is in a whole lot of trouble
7495198 in a discussion of abortion itself obama wrote that government has more important business than
7495199 well i was 29 years old when i came to the us senate
7495200 joe biden has represented the state of delaware in the united states senate since 1972 when he was elected at the age of twenty nine
7495201 no person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years
7495202 when franklin roosevelt died during the closing days of wwii it fell to truman to end the war and formulate policies for the new world order
7495203 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome the real enemy then is humanity itself
7495204 weve got to ride the global warming issue even if the theory of global warming is wrong we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy
7495205 a black man born of a white mother could lift america
7495206 he obama cherishes every cause for complaint he can discern against white folks
7495207 ceased to advertise my mothers race at the age of twelve or thirteen when i began to suspect that by doing so i was ingratiating myself to whites
7495208 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7495209 i dont think that much is accomplished by hosting parties in terms of the legislative agenda so were not trying to compete on that basis
7495210 frankly im pretty confident about the level of support working families get from the democratic party businesses may be less secure and may be looking for ways to get attention
7495211 a lot of our events are about calling attention to what we think needs to be the priorities in the obama administration all of our events are really substantive
7495212 close loopholes that allow rampant unregulated oil speculation and to support giving the commodities futures trading commission cftc greater regulatory and enforcement authority
7495213 the governor had an obligation to raise funds for the convention and the financial obligation is tremendous
7495214 this is about civic pride for the state of colorado from our unions perspective we are supporting the democratic candidate and party and it needs to have the money to run a good convention program you cant do it in a pup tent
7495215 its not some secretive soft money slush fund because its really going to a convention
7495216 we ended the role of federal officeholders seeking huge unlimited contributions for the federal electoral process
7495217 a package of in kind commitments designed to help the city and state promote themselves it has nothing to do with politics it has nothing to do with the party
7495218 the presidential conventions give at amp t a unique opportunity to present and display the many leading edge technologies and products that we offer to tens of thousands of consumers
7495219 frank marshall davis alleged communist was early influence on barack obama
7495220 although identified only as frank in mr obamas memoir dreams from my father it has now been established that he was frank marshall davis a radical activist and journalist who had been suspected of being a member of the communist party in the 1950s
7495221 my reporting conclusion was the role of frank had been hyped out of all proportion both by obama himself in his book and some others later he did not play a role in really shaping obama
7495222 was chatting with him davis that late autumn afternoon as dunham and barry obama approached
7495223 its possible he briefly went back to indonesia before actually starting at the school
7495224 frank never really did drugs though he and stan would smoke pot together
7495225 bridges of course always denied party membership and attempts were made to deport him because he was a communist he was born in australia but he was able to fight back because he had very very sharp shyster lawyers and a lot of friends in the u s government that helped him and they prevented his deportation but he had been a major force promoting communism
7495226 the book which closely tracks mr daviss life in chicago and hawaii and the fact that his first wife was black and his second white describes in lurid detail a series of shockingly sordid sexual encounters often involving group sex one chapter concerns the seduction by mr davis and his first wife of a 13 year old girl called anne mr davis wrote that it was the girl who had suggested he had sex with her
7495227 he then described how he and his wife would have sex with the girl
7495228 mr davis would cruise in hawaii parks looking for couples or female tourists to have sex with he derived sexual gratification from bondage simulated rape and being flogged and urinated on
7495229 left himself some wiggle room not least i suppose because of the possibility of prosecution
7495230 questi braccialetti della sicurezza vogliono parlare un linguaggio sussurrato da un bambino ai genitori da un partner allaltro tramite un messaggio quasi intimo che ricordi a chi lavora che la sicurezza anche un dovere verso se stessi e verso gli altri e che i nostri cari vogliono che venga rispettato perch il futuro dipende da questo
7495231 lobiettivo promuovere una cultura della sicurezza da indossare una sorta di pret porter della sicurezza l dove il bello e pronto non un prodotto commerciale ma un oggetto testimonianza di valore affettivo che vuole indurre chi lo indossa a metabolizzare i significati di cui si fa portatore
7495232 esatto noi invece vogliamo dare loro un significato nuovo chi indossa uno di questi braccialetti diventa veicolo attivo del messaggio che vi inciso sopra e di fatto come se si facesse carico anche fisicamente del problema oggi esiste indubbiamente un buon livello di sensibilizzazione nei confronti delle tematiche legate alla sicurezza sul lavoro il passaggio faticoso che si tratta adesso di realizzare promuovere la consapevolezza del ruolo che ciascuno pu avere nella prevenzione ecco perch abbiamo scelto di incidere su tre dei cinque braccialetti prodotti degli espliciti messaggi di tipo affettivo che risuonano come lesortazione a stare attenti che un figlio pu rivolgere genitori o un partner allaltro

7495239 carry their belongings with you so that they dont lose them
7495240 i am very happy because we got an agreement with the people from the club
7495241 i was also trying to push it so we could get the deal done because people were talking too much about situations which werent really there
7495242 so i think that starting this week we can have an easy week now in training and just concentrate on each game
7495243 i also think that the people at the club can now relax they are making jokes already
7495244 it is going to be very positive to the mentality of the team and that is why it is important
7495245 i think it is great news for the fans but also for the players the gaffer and for me it wasnt a good thing to get phone calls every day asking me what is happening
7495246 so for me it is very important that it is all done and now i can just focus now on blackburn and football im 100 percent a blackburn player and i will keep working hard
7495247 ive been in discussions with the rfu aimed at growing the game not just at regional level but at premiership level too for a number of months
7495248 there are clear implications for the premiership and i will be holding discussions with those clubs in a couple of weeks time
7495249 these proposals will create exciting competition which the game needs and will also bring additional money to replace the edf energy cup
7495250 yes it is the second time from the last two races so we have to understand and analyse and solve the problem for sure
7495251 he did everything perfect no mistake at all the car pace was very good it was fantastic really
7495252 in qualifying kimi didnt make the perfect lap so he lost two tenths during the race his target was to jump heikki kovalainen and he was close to doing that but then he had a problem with the pit stop
7495253 stavo talmente male che faticavo ad alzarmi in piedi ad un certo punto ho pensato di non correre
7495254 non mi lamento del secondo posto perch qui difficile superare ho dimostrato che potevo tenere il passo della ferrari per cui le nostre prestazioni non sono in discussione anche sul fronte dei costruttori ci siamo ulteriormente avvicinati
7495255 chi meglio di me in formula 1 solo alonso e raikkonen
7495256 if the germ theory of disease were true wed all be dead
7495257 everyone has from 100 10 000 cancer cells floating in their body at all times
7495258 sniffles sneezes and fever are good for you they clear the airways of harmful irritants and allergy causing substances fevers actually fight virus and bacteria if a fever isnt over 104 degrees diseases are shortened by letting the fever run its course coughing rids the body of bacteria and virus by way of the lungs if you take fever reducing drugs or cough suppressants that can lead to pneumonia or more serious respiratory infection
7495259 je hoeft niet naar de kliniek van jef hoeyberghs te gaan om een total make over te ondergaan
7495260 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7495261 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7495262 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7495263 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7495264 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7495265 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7495266 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7495267 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7495268 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7495269 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7495270 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
7495271 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7495272 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7495273 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7495274 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
7495275 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
7495276 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
7495277 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7495278 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7495279 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7495280 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7495281 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7495282 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7495283 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7495284 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7495285 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7495286 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7495287 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7495288 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7495289 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7495290 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7495291 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
7495292 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7495293 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7495294 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7495295 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7495296 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7495297 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7495298 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7495299 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7495300 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7495301 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7495302 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7495303 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7495304 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7495305 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7495306 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7495307 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7495308 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7495309 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7495310 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7495311 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7495312 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7495313 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7495314 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7495315 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7495316 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7495317 honey if you think youre gonna puke i think thats what those clearance bags are setting there for
7495318 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7495319 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7495320 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7495321 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7495322 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7495323 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7495324 most people have been conditioned their entire lives to find what they lose and thats why over 60 of dieters put their weight back on
7495325 the work is on the mind and the body picturing yourself at your perfect weight with this visualization and learning how to use the power of the mind to release weight anyone can and will achieve their perfect weight for a lifetime
7495326 we provide people with what has been eluding them with all of the other programs and fad diets they have tried their perfect weight we want to help change the global obesity epidemic in the world by changing one mind one body at a time
7495327 the starting point of all achievement is desire keep this constantly in mind strengthen your desire weak desire brings weak results just as a small amount of fire makes a small amount of heat

7495381 making clothes together in our studio makes us feel complete

7495383 when you are a big band and everyone is taking shots at you the more things you can do together the better
7495384 and if youre wearing uniforms made by your own hands it helps
7495385 there is almost a contempt for success in the national character a lampooning of celebrity a tradition of putting it down
7495386 but just when you think theyre ignoring you to the point of disdain the government and the queen suddenly say actually we rather like you and give you a knighthood its the most delicious and wonderful balance which happens nowhere else in the world
7495387 che luomo sia lacerato dal cielo e dalla terra pazienza ma il peggio che

7495394 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7495395 none of us are accomplished sailors and a few have only had experience with small dinghies its not going to be easy and it definitely wont be a case of setting up the sails and then sitting down with a gin and tonic
7495396 itll take us about 12 hours and in that time were going to have to battle against changing winds from different angles and we might have to deal with sea sickness too
7495397 this is the first match of the final round and it is very important i chose these 20 players who are able to fight in hot weather and understand the concept of the team very well

7495406 but there is no doubt this would be the icing on the cake
7495407 at what age can we really start using the jogging stroller for jogging the folks who work at the running store are well kinda macho about it we started when she was 2 months old and the books literature online sometimes say as late as 8 months
7495408 at that point the head will not bounce around and there will be minimal danger of the kinds of acceleration deceleration that might cause injury

7495413 its more of the fueling you need during the event
7495414 as a walker were not race walkers we dont usually like the power gels that runners use were able to eat gummi bears some people have even done peanut butter and honey sandwiches
7495415 it takes a lot of determination for someone who wants to walk a full marathon
7495416 we definitely see the walkers as an area thats growing
7495417 a lot of people register as runners for some reason theres a stigma attached to walking so they dont want to register as a walker
7495418 weve gotten some feedback from the runners that there are definitely more walkers out there
7495419 we enjoy having the walkers there we understand theyre a big part of the race
7495420 the patients do feel a tingle in their scalp which is not at all unpleasant that is really our only side effect and it is not at all a problem it merely indicates to the patient that there has been a treatment medications are somewhat effective but they all have side effects our treatment has zero side effects
7495421 those with the placebo device the headache eventually went away by itself
7495422 the headaches in all the subjects went away but it went away much faster for those using the device than those not using the device
7495423 shows that tms is a safe and effective treatment for the 7 million americans who have migraine with aura
7495424 every summer a few of my associates and i have what we call an innovation retreat
7495425 we get together and say what does the world need to be invented and we try to invent it
7495426 migraine is a mechanism that is built into the human brain we all possess it and it becomes active by an efficient build up of its triggers
7495427 but once those triggers rise above the threshold migraine becomes activated and symptoms occur
7495428 the degree of symptoms depends on how high above the threshold your triggers are
7495429 i used to have migraines and some medicines made me sicker than the headache
7495430 this is a nondrug treatment for bad headaches thats why its important
7495431 the bottom line from my perspective is that its best to prevent it rather than to walk around with some expensive hardware to zap yourself every time you get an aura
7495432 we want to make sure people know exactly who sen obama is and where he wants to take the country and two that voters know their choice in this election between barack obama who wants to fundamentally change the way business is done in washington and john mccain who is just more of the same of what we have had over the course of the last eight years
7495433 hes got to be focused simple and clear rather than elegiac this is not a great novel this is a short clear focused discussion unless it is clear and real simple he has failed
7495434 obama certainly hasnt opened up any huge lead over john mccain in a year that should be an easy year for a democratic candidate
7495435 i think the country still wants to know who barack obama is and where he wants to take the country in a more specific direction than he has given
7495436 you cant lose the change mantra but youve got to continue to indict mccain
7495437 the bottom line is do you want four more years when they leave the convention they need to have fairly vetted that and answered that question
7495438 the guys got a great story and people dont know it
7495439 the whole kennedy family will be in a special section it should be quite a moment
7495440 my hunch is that this is going to end up being one of the worst moments in the entire campaign for one of the candidates but its barack obama
7495441 dont you think that was going to come up anyway
7495442 the deferral of tax cuts would reduce household incomes in the near term the advice from treasury said

7495446 the parent is justified in using force by way of correction towards a child if that force is reasonable in the circumstances
7495447 crimes abolition of force as a justification for child discipline amendment bill
7495448 the offence is considered to be so inconsequential that there is no public interest in proceeding with a prosecution
7495449 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand
7495450 nothing justifies the use of force for the purpose of correction
7495451 the police have the discretion not to prosecute complaints against a parent of a child or person in the place of a parent of a child in relation to an offence involving the use of force against a child where the offence is considered to be so inconsequential that there is no public interest in proceeding with a prosecution

7495640 today we are faced with im not afraid to say a historic decision to call upon the president of the russian federation to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
7495641 this is a consequence of the recognition of kosovo by the west and western policy in the balkans
7495642 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7495643 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7495644 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility
7495645 its going faster in some places than others because you have different cultures and different ways that universities do things
7495646 try to imagine the sheer horror of having both democrat and republican parties under the control of the liberal left itll be the downfall of the united states and will open the door to the internationalists who believe america is simply a cash cow for the world

7495651 lorsquelle se trouve confront e la barbarie la plus totale
7495652 je pense notamment au sacrifice de nos dix jeunes soldats face ces barbares moyen geux terroristes que nous combattons en afghanistan
7495653 en se souvenant d v nements comme ceux qui se sont produits
7495654 que nos enfants sauront quil ne faut jamais transiger avec le totalitarisme quil ne faut jamais transiger avec le fanatisme quil ne faut jamais transiger avec les id ologies de mort
7495655 i invite anyone who has not been to a valley of the sun chapter astd event in some time to look again this is not the astd you think you know
7495656 thank you for the opportunity to speak to your astd chapter everyone i spoke to had glowing things to say about the chapter i definitely would be interested in speaking your fall conference thank you again for the opportunity i had a blast
7495657 excellent choice in having lunch meeting best food ive had for an astd meeting speaker was very enthusiastic
7495658 it was my great pleasure to join astd vos and to attend my first meeting meagan was fantastic and i heard from other attendees that all your speakers are great looking forward to joining you for many more
7495659 megan johnson was the best speaker presentation ive attended since joining the vos astd group in october 2006 as a member coming from orange county ca it has been a welcome boost to know that i can continue my association with astd now that i am residing in phoenix thank you for your extraordinary efforts on behalf of our valley of the sun members it is truly making a positive difference
7495660 as a long time member since 1991 and someone who has not been at a meeting for a long time it seems like youre doing all the right things to rebuild the chapter and get people involved
7495661 as of right now weve got two of the at least top five teams in the u s
7495662 i hope to go to worlds and also the olympics which is in two years
7495663 in pairs skating if you guys stick together just like a marriage then you know you will see success in the end
7495664 this is a unique application its no risk or cost to island customers said maritime electric spokeswoman kim griffin
7495665 this line is paid for by suez energy north america and the government of p e i so it has no effect on the customers of p e i in terms of cost or risk
7495666 i can understand where it may be confusing for people griffin said
7495667 its a fairly detailed process when you undergo any project of this magnitude and were at the stage now where were working to comply with all the regulations and stipulations she said
7495668 the company cant really go forward until they get an amendment to the capital budget approved from us as well as get an environmental permit for the full line he said
7495669 i think theyd be reluctant to start not knowing if they could finish it and i certainly think the commission wouldnt be prepared to approve the capital budget if they didnt have environmental approval
7495670 unlike the fashionista elite who dictate style from on high ryz invites anyone to design the perfect pair of shoes well produce the most popular designs sell them around the world and share the profits with the designer everybody wins
7495671 today we must fulfill what is i think our historic mission to defend small countries from aggressors
7495672 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7495673 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7495674 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7495675 im very fond of abhishek whatever happened between ash and me is over im really fond of the bachchans abhishek is a buddy and i really like him i wont have anyone speak badly about his wife

7495678 ahora rafa sentir lo que yo sent durante mucho tiempo
7495679 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
7495680 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7495681 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility
7495682 its going faster in some places than others because you have different cultures and different ways that universities do things
7495683 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7495684 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication
7495685 its easy and somebody could learn an entirely different language
7495686 left up could be turning lights on right down could be turning off the tv
7495687 you know the path of least resistance it can lead through a minefield
7495688 dat heeft te maken met contracten die hiervoor worden afgesloten
7495689 t mobile wil al doende kijken waar er behoefte aan is en het eventueel uitbreiden
7495690 deze dienst sluit aan bij de vraag in de markt er was ook vraag naar videoconferencing maar dat komt nog niet echt van de grond ik denk dat mobiele tv daarentegen beter zal aanslaan
7495691 i will lie to you to make as much money as possible
7495692 even at the same location the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 feet 1 52m above the ground and different again from 10 feet or 50 feet above the ground
7495693 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7495694 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted
7495695 taking profits in his china holdings just before that market lost half its value all were brilliant moves and will more than compensate for any mistakes he made in timing the u

7495707 estamos convencidos que estas medidas injustificadas responden a las pretensiones de sometimiento del inpec y de las autoridades del establecimiento las cuales se inventan falsos planes de fuga para afectar nuestros derechos fundamentales
7495708 nos sorprende que se pretenda justificar las agresiones contra los presos pol ticos y prisioneros de guerra que nos encontr bamos recluidos en la torre tres de este establecimiento carcelario cuando en diversas oportunidades se nos reconoci por parte del cuerpo de custodia y vigilancia nuestro comportamiento y nivel de convivencia ejemplar en el mismo
7495709 llamamos a las personas y organizaciones solidarias y defensoras de los derechos humanos nacionales e internacionales a exigir de las autoridades colombianas el respeto de nuestros derechos y que cesen inmediatamente las agresiones contra nosotros

7495745 il mio cinema fatto di universi sfilacciati e inafferrabili dove la ricerca della verit di una ragione o di un motivo sembra arrivare a conclusioni vittoriose che poi per si attorcigliano sempre si espandono verso confini che non si possono misurare trasformando lavori che partono come storie di genere in abissi dellincomprensibilit delle ragioni delluomo e delle sue azioni

7495753 lamore fa schifo a volte ti fa sentire bene talvolta solo un altro modo per sanguinare

7495759 langston had a bad bruise we took him in for x rays and the x rays were negative so were optimistic he got wacked by something and it was either one of them or one of us that hit him i think it might have been one of us which is nobodys fault it happens
7495760 i want to remember him in his days of just undiluted glory
7495761 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7495762 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7495763 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7495764 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7495765 began to be realized when civil rights act of 1964
7495766 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7495767 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7495768 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7495769 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7495770 the sense of that seems to be very much lost
7495771 all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others
7495772 xtend medical is pleased to announce that we have secured the global distribution rights to ddis patented vibration technology device now in its fourth generation once the fda has cleared the device for sale we will immediately begin marketing the product to our managed care companies and the various physicians and patients here in the u s were also in negotiations to market the product in south korea and europe based on their separate criteria needs for final approval once these are received then well target these markets heavily although the device can pre screen people that may have diabetic neuropathy the first signs that diabetes may be present it also assists the current diabetic patient with monitoring their neuropathy levels so their disease is managed correctly we anticipate this device to bring in additional sales upwards of 5 million per year in the u s and possibly three times that amount globally

7495779 too often vehicles branded due to some form of severe damage are reconstructed and re titled without their damage related brand and then sold to unsuspecting consumers
7495780 with such a large number of title washed vehicles on the road today consumers shopping for a reliable used car or truck need to get an autocheck vehicle history report for all vehicles they consider buying
7495781 consumers need to arm themselves with as much information as possible when shopping for a used vehicle
7495782 an autocheck vehicle history report will show past title brands and designations of prior damage providing used vehicle shoppers with the peace of mind they need to know that the vehicle they are buying is reliable and most importantly safe
7495783 data replication projects can be complicated and require administrative expertise our objective is to have dbmoto reduce that complexity so that any it manager or user can easily implement important projects with our ibm and net standards based connectivity technology we provide reliability and peace of mind to it managers who need to bridge legacy production data with business applications the result is a huge benefit in focusing time on business critical objectives rather than fine tuning data replication and synchronization procedures
7495784 dbmoto 6 5 streamlines the process to manage large scale data integration projects and yet requires only a small footprint at a reasonable investment

7495791 he may drive a ford escape hybrid now but its hard to forget the blingy chrysler 300c was his whip until his media handlers took charge
7495792 like mccain himself its getting a second wind thanks to rising gas prices
7495793 obama has been a vocal supporter of biodiesel and each of the detroit carmakers is planning diesel for their big trucks
7495794 its a new turbo diesel estimated at 50 mpg on the highway
7495795 obamacans will flock to it along with some of the other 300 000 plus buyers who line up for the accord each year
7495796 obama wants 4 billion for detroit to build new small cars and ford is already planning on building it in north america
7495797 they could use the incentives to make a hybrid or diesel version for real 50 mpg capability
7495798 it was perhaps a little too extravagant for a democrat
7495799 now hes driving the politicians stand by a ford escape hybrid but he hasnt been able to shake the 300c image
7495800 throw mitt romney in the back seat have him come up with a way to lop 5000 off the sticker price and its a deal
7495801 the prius is poised for an even stronger second wind under mccain
7495802 you can refill it at home and you can get natural gas from domestic sources
7495803 mccain wants more nuclear power which will help keep the volt charged up and hes in favor of tax credits for zero carbon emission cars
7495804 giving power to the people doesnt have to involve fossil fuels
7495805 and this proves mccain is as green as republicans come
7495806 chronic low back pain can have a significant impact on a persons ability to do the things they enjoy
7495807 this research may offer hope to those dealing with this debilitating condition
7495808 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7495809 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7495810 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7495811 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees
7495812 we took the bacon down to one day a week
7495813 its just something everyone loves you walk in schools and smell that bacon frying and the kids go crazy

7495815 it was an open match and the league looks as if it is going to be that way there are more dangerous players up front in this division there will be more threat from the opposition and we have to be more diligent with what we do defensively we cannot allow goals to happen that have happened in the last two games games like this will be on a knife edge when we were good we were excellent but there were also one or two juvenile mistakes that cost us
7495816 we have a great foundation we have a great work ethic and we have shown that we have people with talent and ability i have always believed that but we have a platform for them to go and show that we are going to get better we will be a stronger unit as players come back and i said it would be nice if we had some points by the time we got to the stage where we had everyone fit and available
7495817 it was an entertaining spectacle we have won one drawn one and lost one now we had a similar lesson at this stage of last season against leicester and this is a lesson for us again we were slow out the blocks we clawed our way back into it forest kept coming and they scored again but we came back into it again then we got done by a set piece that hit the post and they followed up on the loose ball quicker than we did
7495818 i wouldnt want to take anything away from forest they played really well and the game was an entertaining spectacle i am all for that as long as we win more than we lose we got in a situation where we allowed forest to get into the game because we did not make good decisions with the ball
7495819 forest have spent some money it is a big club you can smell it in the air around the place there is history here

7495821 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there every night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much youre worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry that john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7495822 yes pirates floors open what are you cheering and jeering about today
7495823 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7495824 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7495825 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7495826 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7495827 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7495828 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7495829 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7495830 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself

7495833 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7495834 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7495835 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7495836 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7495837 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7495838 sometimes i have so much sex to try to calm myself down i get bored of it and men i sleep with dont seem to make as much effort because i climax so easily
7495839 within a few weeks i just began to get more and more aroused more and more of the time and i just kept having endless orgasms it started off in bed where sex sessions would last for hours and my boyfriend would be stunned at how many times i would orgasm then it would happen after sex id be thinking about what wed done in bed and id start feeling a bit flushed then id become aroused and climax in six months i was having 150 orgasms a day and it has been as many as 200
7495840 often ill want to wear myself out by having as many orgasms as i can so they stop and i can get some peace
7495841 the brain literally is squeezed into the spinal column what happens is you get compression squeezing strangulating of the brain stem which has all the vital functions that control sleep speech our cranial nerves our circulatory system even our breathing system

7495845 graham arnold is one of two very strong candidates we have spoken to about the job and its a 50 50 thing at the moment
7495846 he has a contract with the ffa but well talk to him this week and see where it goes there is also another very strong candidate and well make a decision hopefully by the end of next week because appointing a top coach is a huge priority for us
7495847 we believe he is highly capable and feel some of criticism he has copped is unfair
7495848 people can say what they like opinions are like backsides everybody has one but it doesnt make them all great i feel he did well coaching australia in a very difficult group in china
7495849 they played really well against eventual champions argentina a 1 0 loss and i think that reflected very well on arnold at that level it was no disgrace for australia to lose
7495850 whoever gets the job we want somebody who can come in with a clean slate and build their own team
7495851 its all about player development here were going to have a high performance centre and we want a coach who can oversee that and help bring kids through to our top squad
7495852 i have a lot of time and respect for graham and also the other front runner and we just have to make sure we make the right decision
7495853 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7495854 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7495855 we had lost hope that my brother would be released because hes been in prison for 32 years
7495856 we may be on the verge of a turning point in the battle against abortion
7495857 response to our call for communities to participate in this falls 40 days for life campaign has exceeded our wildest expectations
7495858 were especially pleased to see three canadian cities joining 40 days for life this fall
7495859 as there will also be a campaign in washington d c this means that 40 days for life will have a presence in the capitals of two nations we firmly believe that this campaign of prayer and fasting will have a profound impact
7495860 the growth of this outreach is a reflection of the excitement that people are expressing about the many ways 40 days for life impacts a community this program is being embraced by cities conducting their first 40 days for life and those who are planning their second third or in the case of bryan college station texas fourth campaign
7495861 planned parenthood is a special concern because it is the nations largest abortion provider
7495862 this fall marks a critical time for our country and our culture and this heartfelt effort to pray and fast for an end to abortion is crucial with regards to our future and what sort of nation we wish to become
7495863 we hope to share the truth about what abortion does to every community where it is practiced and to make this fall the beginning of the end of abortion in america

7495871 the electrical sector seems to have entered a dead end street and far from considering a rational solution to the tragedy the problem acquires an increasingly greater magnitude
7495872 everyone said let her go let her go and i was embarrassed because im not that type of person
7495873 standard operating procedure is to not notify the fire department immediately because often times the train is able to regain power and go to the station
7495874 we attempted to do that in this case but when those attempts failed the fire department was notified
7495875 just kind of stopped everybody thought it was a temporary thing we didnt realize it would take so long
7495876 i was relieved to not go up the space needle because im afraid of heights
7495877 its a beautiful city and in spite of this ill be back
7495878 i got afraid when i got on the ladder because i looked down
7495879 the last one we chased the guy from out here through the neighborhood in the back and we ended up catching him
7495880 its all working class people that are just trying to make ends meet
7495881 its very scary very scary because i had no idea this was going on
7495882 you couldnt see the body of the fire with the heavy black smoke
7495883 but being an upholstering company theyre in the right business to fix the damage
7495884 a three storey house number 33 in nikitinskaya street and the roof of the paired house number 35 were on fire the fire covered the area of 300 square meters six dead bodies including one childs body were found on the scene
7495885 the childs body had minor burns the other four were not burnt at all most likely they and the child choked on smoke
7495886 our environmental team is there along with our hazmat hazardous materials guys
7495887 we actually let this fire burn out yesterday we didnt use any foam in the morning there were still some very small smoldering fires we treated those with foam
7495888 the cars may not immediately be removed from the scene
7495889 but they will be in a place where they pose no threat to the community no threat to our employees
7495890 the price of steel to automotive applications in the u s and abroad has most probably increased by some 100 to 150 per car produced since 2007
7495891 one of the reasons tata has been able to price the nano so aggressively is because they signed contracts for five to seven years with suppliers
7495892 what theyll probably do is churn out the first few at that price and then quietly raise the price
7495893 with a car like the nano and the sort of project where you announce a certain price point it represents a huge challenge
7495894 most any child can have the mumps or even german measles so heres a record of my health from chicken pox to sneezles
7495895 my staff said when you get out there your goal you cannot go to sleep at night until you collect 25 viable cards from people to be able to call in the next few weeks
7495896 its particularly exciting for those of us who were there from the beginning who believed in the potential of this man
7495897 it was the greatest investment that i could do in my whole political career that i ever made is to wrap my arms around a very intelligent bright young man and help push him forward
7495898 nel sud alcune scuole abbassano la qualit dellascuola italiana in sicilia puglia calabria e basilicataorganizzeremo corsi intensivi per gli insegnanti
7495899 spero davvero che il ministrogelmini si riferisse alle condizioni di arretratezza delledilizia scolastica del sud perch la preparazione degliinsegnanti di primissimo livello
7495900 luso del grembiule lobbligo di alzarsi in piedi allarrivo dellinsegnante il ritorno della valutazione dellacondotta servono a reimpostare quei concetti sani di disciplina e autorit che smatellati dalla cultura disinistra proveniente dal 68 hanno impoverito la scuola italiana
7495901 non ho mai detto chegli insegnanti del sud abbassano la qualit della scuola italiana chi riporta il mio pensiero in questo modo in grave malafede e vuole creare una polemica che chi conosce il mio pensiero sa che non ha fondamento
7495902 ho sempre ritenuto che esistono bravi professori sia al nord che alil sud ha oggi un deficit strutturale e di progettualit che non certo imputabile al corpo docente

7495904 thats devastating when i should be phoning and asking her how shes doing instead shes phoning us and asking us how were doing
7495905 i thought that everything was after letting go and that the house was gone
7495906 it doesnt feel comfortable here every little sound like when someone knocks on the door i jump and i think i got to get out im on pins and needles all the time
7495907 its not one hundred per cent that the house is going to be safe theyre telling me i should have a suitcase ready in case it happens again
7495908 every time now when it starts to rain theres that uneasiness that something else is going to happen i never had any flooding and when i see a lot of rain in the forecast i get that uneasy feeling we got a good scare
7495909 it could have happened but i dont think it will happen now
7495910 theyre going to put in larger culverts and i think theres going to have to be some larger changes made down in the community
7495911 he said he wouldnt let us stay here if he didnt know it was safe
7495912 he was telling us what they were doing up there on the roads so i was able to lie down for a few hours
7495913 they need not be nervous we wouldnt open that road if it wasnt safe we found a crevice there when we were on site and that has been repaired
7495914 if they could get up and say i wont have to be living in fear or worry about that that would be an awful nice thing too but i dont think anyone can guarantee that

7495931 you look at the intersection of airport and memorial you see a lot of people change lanes there
7495932 they dont realize its a right hand turning lane until they get right up on it they think its going straight and then all of a sudden they see a lane change and its a quick lane change so any time we can get paint visible on the road all year round its a benefit at least as far as safety goes
7495933 our crews can only cover so much ground the first couple of weeks of spring
7495934 and if you dont have to paint it right off the bat obviously its going to be better for the driving public
7495935 in the wintertime we scrape all the paint off the danger zones are the intersections trying to see where the lanes are where the stop bars are and so forth so we would concentrate on intersections only at this point
7495936 we have an intersection at roe and cooper where the traffic lights are activated from sensors
7495937 if people dont pull to the right place in the intersection the sensor isnt activated
7495938 that is one intersection in particular that wed pay attention to because thats an issue for us once we paint that line the issue seems to go away so were pretty sure that its the fact that the car isnt moving up to the proper stop bar and isnt activating the lights
7495939 where i can see it being a benefit would be with people from out of town
7495940 so often you see them change lanes last minute or theyre not really aware youre coming down airport and we all know its two lanes but when the paint is really faint there you see people driving straight down the middle

7495959 when i was growing up i felt the dragons were my family
7495960 but today the dragons are angry with us and see us as enemies
7495961 we dont want the komodo dragon to be domesticated its against natural balance
7495962 we have to keep this conservation area for the purpose of wildlife it is not for human beings
7495963 if we let the locals hunt again the dragons will be gone
7495964 if we are not strict in enforcing the ban everything here will be destroyed
7495965 people are scared because every day the dragons come down and eat our goats
7495966 today its a goat and tomorrow it can be our child
7495967 we threw branches and stones to drive him away but the dragon was crazed with blood and just wouldnt let go
7495968 i dont blame the dragons for my boys death i blame those who forbade us from following custom and feeding them

7496011 we are close to bringing an end to the work we started last season but we know we will have to play with the same determination that we did in the first leg in turin
7496012 we will face a team who are eager to play a great game in front of their fans so it will not be easy for us
7496013 obviously were in a very good position to qualify but we cant forget that this side defeated celtic fc 5 0 in uefa champions league qualifying three years ago
7496014 we are satisfied with the way we played in turin but we shouldnt think too much about that result
7496015 four goals should be enough but only if we will play with the same spirit and determination as in the game in turin

7496129 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7496130 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7496131 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7496132 we had lost hope that my brother would be released because hes been in prison for 32 years
7496133 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7496134 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7496135 we will not rest until the prisoners are freed and the jails are empty
7496136 he is our brother and we must struggle to free all prisoners

7496139 as players as a club playing for the title we dont want to lose a single game but we have lost the defeat is there we cannot change that
7496140 we just have to keep on going try to be focused a little better and achieve things
7496141 now the title becomes a bit difficult as we have lost the second game of the season
7496142 i have a lot of respect for crouch and defoe
7496143 they are good players and will score a lot of goals this year especially at home
7496144 crouch is tall and wins most things in the air and defoe is very quick around the box he is a sharp player who makes problems for defenders
7496145 but as defenders we are here to deal with situations like that
7496146 we know who we are playing against so we need to prepare properly because it is very important we get the three points
7496147 we have started badly but it is a long season and we have plenty of time to put it right portsmouth will want to show they are not as bad as they looked last week but we will be ready
7496148 i am not saying portsmouth are bad but when it is one of the top teams the community shield is like a derby and you really want to win
7496149 it is only two games if it was the last games of the season maybe there would be pressure but now no
7496150 i think teams have time now to lose some points
7496151 i understand that we didnt play like last week but i also understand the reasons why
7496152 but they fought and it was possible to win the game it is fantastic for chelsea and fantastic for our group because we have confidence and we have six points
7496153 in my eyes yes we did enough i think most people who witnessed it would say that too
7496154 but they have given everything when you play these big teams sometimes you have to ride your luck we didnt have to do that because we played well against them
7496155 when you analyse it our goalkeeper didnt have a save to make thats almost unheard of against

7496238 69 now peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also wast with jesus of galilee 70 but he denied before them all saying i know not what thou sayest 71 and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that were there this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth 72 and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man 73 and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to peter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech bewrayeth thee 74 then began he to curse and to swear saying i know not the man and immediately the cock crew 75 and peter remembered the word of jesus which said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly
7496239 17 from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand 18 and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers 19 and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men
7496240 14 and when jesus was come into peters house he saw his wifes mother laid and sick of a fever 15 and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto them
7496241 22 and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away 23 and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone 24 but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary 25 and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea 26 and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear 27 but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid 28 and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water 29 and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus 30 but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me 31 and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt 32 and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased 33 then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god
7496242 5 likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble
7496243 6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time
7496244 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour 9 whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world
7496245 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall
7496246 14 wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless
7496247 58 but peter followed him afar off unto the high priests palace and went in and sat with the servants to see the end
7496248 54 and peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the high priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire
7496249 13 nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness 14 wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless
7496250 17 ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness
7496251 15 so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my lambs 16 he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas lovest thou me he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep 17 he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep
7496252 1 when the morning was come all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death 2 and when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor
7496253 57 and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled
7496254 2 and when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor
7496255 7 he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth
7496256 12 then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus and bound him 13 and led him away to annas first for he was father in law to caiaphas which was the high priest that same year 14 now caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people
7496257 2 annas and caiaphas being the high priests the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness
7496258 22 and when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand saying answerest thou the high priest so 23 jesus answered him if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me
7496259 57 and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled
7496260 59 now the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false witness against jesus to put him to death 60 but found none yea though many false witnesses came yet found they none at the last came two false witnesses 61 and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days
7496261 69 now peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also wast with jesus of galilee 70 but he denied before them all saying i know not what thou sayest 71 and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that were there this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth 72 and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man 73 and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to peter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech bewrayeth thee 74 then began he to curse and to swear saying i know not the man and immediately the cock crew 75 and peter remembered the word of jesus which said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly
7496262 1 when the morning was come all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death
7496263 2 and when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor
7496264 1 there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices
7496265 1 and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto pilate 2 and they began to accuse him saying we found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesar saying that he himself is christ a king
7496266 4 then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people i find no fault in this man
7496267 5 and they were the more fierce saying he stirreth up the people teaching throughout all jewry beginning from galilee to this place
7496268 6 when pilate heard of galilee he asked whether the man were a galilaean 7 and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herods jurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself also was at jerusalem at that time
7496269 8 and when herod saw jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him
7496270 7 now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he was perplexed because that it was said of some that john was risen from the dead 8 and of some that elias had appeared and of others that one of the old prophets was risen again 9 and herod said john have i beheaded but who is this of whom i hear such things and he desired to see him
7496271 9 then he questioned with him in many words but he answered him nothing
7496272 38 pilate saith unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find in him no fault at all 39 but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews
7496273 16 and they had then a notable prisoner called barabbas 17 therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus which is called christ 18 for he knew that for envy they had delivered him
7496274 7 and there was one named barabbas which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him who had committed murder in the insurrection
7496275 20 but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabbas and destroy jesus 21 the governor answered and said unto them whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you they said barabbas 22 pilate saith unto them what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ they all say unto him let him be crucified 23 and the governor said why what evil hath he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified
7496276 26 then released he barabbas unto them and when he had scourged jesus he delivered him to be crucified
7496277 27 then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers
7496278 28 and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe
7496279 31 and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him
7496280 44 and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me 45 then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures 46 and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day 47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem
7496281 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed
7496282 46 and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day 47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem
7496283 22 pilate saith unto them what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ they all say unto him let him be crucified
7496284 matthew 27 11 12 b his silence caused pilate to marvel greatly then said pilate unto him hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee 14 and he answered him to never a word insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly
7496285 when then shall i do with jesus who is called christ
7496286 22 pilate saith unto them what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ they all say unto him let him be crucified
7496287 33 these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
7496288 10 for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost
7496289 7 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
7496290 24 i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins
7496291 3 i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish
7496292 9 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved 10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation
7496293 19 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
7496294 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
7496295 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
7496296 24 i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins
7496297 7 and to you who are troubled rest with us when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
7496298 8 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death
7496299 24 verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life
7496300 29 and every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my names sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life
7496301 32 and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter
7496302 6 as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him 7 rooted and built up in him and stablished in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving
7496303 30 he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad
7496304 32 and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross 33 and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say a place of a skull 34 they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink 35 and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots
7496305 36 and sitting down they watched him there 37 and set up over his head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews 38 then were there two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and another on the left 39 and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads 40 and saying thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the cross 41 likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said 42 he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him 43 he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god 44 the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth
7496306 34 then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots
7496307 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed 6 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
7496308 4 who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and our father
7496309 8 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness 10 if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us
7496310 3 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
7496311 24 and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts
7496312 5 mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry 6 for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience 7 in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them 8 but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth 9 lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds 10 and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him 11 where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free but christ is all and in all
7496313 8 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
7496314 2 and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour
7496315 9 in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him 10 herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
7496316 16 hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren
7496317 13 greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends
7496318 12 this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you
7496319 6 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
7496320 1 we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain
7496321 3 let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves 4 look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus 6 who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god 7 but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men 8 and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross
7496322 16 hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren 17 but whoso hath this worlds good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of god in him 18 my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth

7496397 der kampf gegen hochresistente erreger ist mit den bisherigen mitteln wie dem einsatz immer neuer antibiotika und intensiver desinfektionsma nahmen nicht zu gewinnen wir m ssen neue wege gehen um das gefahrenpotenzial f r unsere patienten zu reduzieren
7496398 es ist aber sicher nicht notwendig und sinnvoll jede abteilung im krankenhaus mit kupferbeschl gen auszustatten
7496399 auf krebs oder aids stationen w re der einsatz sicher sehr angebracht
7496400 die platten m ssen sehr regelm ig geputzt werden denn ansonsten nimmt ihre antibakterielle wirkung aufgrund von schwei und fett das an den t rgriffen haften bleibt schnell ab
7496401 bakterien brauchen maximal zehn jahre bis sie sich einem neuem antibiotikum angepasst haben
7496402 zudem m ssen wir weiterhin daran arbeiten zu verstehen wie bakterien es schaffen resistent gegen antibiotika zu werden

7496415 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
7496416 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
7496417 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero
7496418 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso

7496483 the magnetom trio enables us to study in great depth the brain functionality of volunteers
7496484 ongoing studies at the cbu will help to increase understanding of the brain leading to developments in the clinical side of neuroscience in the long term it will contribute to early diagnosis and create a better understanding of neuropathologies helping to improve outcomes care management and quality of life
7496485 thanks to the advances in mri technology and extensive research we have gained invaluable insight into the nature of vegetative state patients
7496486 our studies in healthy volunteers have been 100 accurate when looking for responses to yes and no questions which has enormous implications for the way conditions such as the vegetative state are assessed understanding these patients is vital for accurate diagnosis as well as for providing information to friends and relatives accurate neural maps open the door to a new type of communication meaning researchers can reach even greater depths of understanding into this condition
7496487 the pace of mri innovation is assisting not only clinical establishments but also research institutions in understanding the way the brain works mri yields detailed images of reactions and neurological functions in patients and healthy subjects this provides physicians and scientists with evidence of reactions that can go towards developing swifter diagnosis and improved care programmes
7496488 we found that there is indeed an association that the lower the ldl cholesterol the higher the risk of cancer
7496489 despite the ldl lowering capacity of statins however the data are quite reassuring that statins dont increase the risk of cancer
7496490 this raised the obvious question and concern that interventions that lower ldl cholesterol might offset the lowered risk of heart disease by increasing the risk of cancer
7496491 there is a bit of a conundrum because previous studies have looked at whether the use of statins increased the risk of cancer and the answer to that was no so we had a bit of quandary how could it be that low ldl is associated with a higher risk of cancer but statins which lower ldl cholesterol dont seem to cause cancer
7496492 we dont know why its true and we can only speculate about the reason
7496493 our study was the first that we know of to systematically review the literature on complication rates of spinal surgery in the elderly population
7496494 given our rapidly increasing numbers of patients over age 65 in the us this is a very relevant topic to spine surgeons and primary care doctors
7496495 one it seems that in experienced centers older patients are able to undergo spinal surgery for stenosis and even fusion for scoliosis and spondylolisthesis with acceptable complication rates provided they are medically fit for surgery two randomized prospective studies are needed to compare treatments and outcomes more systematically in this population currently the literature is retrospective

7496580 its a total diss to senator clinton in my opinion
7496581 it just speaks vol umes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7496582 the simple message to the women who voted for hillary clinton is if you liked the last eight years under george w bush youre going to love the next four under john mccain
7496583 lets be honest its the most disas trous presidency weve had in modern american history and john mccain has said there are not a lot of signifi cant issues that he disagrees with george w bush on
7496584 i suspect hillary clinton will be the good soldier and praise obama and ral ly her supporters to obama but the fact that he doesnt speak until the fourth night of the convention and that her supporters have significant roles on the first three nights could be risky
7496585 clinton and her supporters will be whooping it up on the convention floor for the first three nights while the oba ma backers look askance at them out of the corner of their eye waiting for him to take to the stage on the fourth and fi nal night

7496716 every grandparent would like to see their grandchildren get a college education
7496717 you want the best for them and one of the best things you can give them is a head start towards a college education
7496718 we know how important a college education is to increase a persons earning potential and we also know that since our kids are so close in age they both will probably be in college at the same time
7496719 with the florida college investment plan families choose how much to save and their investment options based on their needs and what they can afford
7496720 the florida college investment plan can be used on its own or combined with a florida prepaid college plan to cover additional college expenses

7496725 florida has a great legacy in aerospace a great foundation to build on and that is one more reason we are so committed to expanding our capability to launch from florida and from the united states
7496726 we have worked closely with the air force over the past several months and look forward to a strong long term relationship as we build these safe commercial launch processes together
7496727 the air force assignment of launch complex 36 is an important next step to extending access to space making it available to defense and security initiatives and multiple commercial payload and launch activities for both civil and private space businesses that wish to launch from florida
7496728 the florida legislature demonstrated tremendous foresight when it appropriated initial funding of 14 5 million for fy 2009 this funding will help space florida begin the launch complex infrastructure design and construction necessary to develop a true commercial multi use launch complex this direction by the air force together with the tremendous support by the state opens the door to attracting supporting and sustaining national and international aerospace business here in florida
7496729 one of space floridas next objectives is to establish a commercial launch zone clz for commercial customers wishing to operate from the eastern range the creation of a clz expands our ability to support commercial payload launch services re supply missions to the international space station and aggressively diversify aerospace business development rapidly and efficiently
7496730 the assignment of launch complex 36 will be an important milestone and part of a broader strategy to establish a clz at the cape
7496731 the commercial launch zone is intended to enable space industry located at the cape and in florida to be more competitive in the global economy

7496734 spending our emergency savings down to the last penny or recklessly hiking taxes would devastate floridas economy

7496746 a cry for defense of womens orders in the high middle ages
7496747 argues that this ordo was established by jesus himself and not by the apostles specifically rejecting the teaching that only the male priesthood and diaconate were part of the original church further this ordo predates even the lord in the great jewish women of hebrew scripture and in anna and in elizabeth whom abelard dramatically described as prophets to the prophets
7496748 in one of the most successful propaganda efforts ever launched a majority of christians came to accept that ordination had always been limited to the priestgood and the diaconate and that women had never served in either ministry
7496749 she wanted it to be decorated with coloured frescoes she used to hold in her lap a book from which she would read stories of events which happened long ago and tell the workmen what she wanted painted on the walls
7496750 when an abbess is ordained she is vested in the sacristy by one dedicated to god and the religious mitre is placed on her head at the conclusion of the rite both received from the bishop a staff and a copy of the rule of the order as well as the kiss of peace from the bishop

7496834 if you believe that america is too smug too self satisfied too rich then lets destroy america
7496835 first to destroy america turn america into a bilingual or multi lingual and bicultural country
7496836 the histories of bilingual and bi cultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil tension and tragedy
7496837 the apparent success of our own multiethnic and multicultural experiment might have been achieved not by tolerance but by hegemony without the dominance that once dictated ethnocentricity and what it meant to be an american we are left with only tolerance and pluralism to hold us together
7496838 i would encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture i would replace the melting pot metaphor with the salad bowl metaphor it is important to ensure that we have various cultural subgroups living in america enforcing their differences rather than as americans emphasizing their similarities
7496839 fourth i would make our fastest growing demographic group the least educated i would add a second underclass unassimilated undereducated and antagonistic to our population i would have this second underclass have a 50 dropout rate from high school
7496840 my fifth point for destroying america would be to get big foundations and business to give these efforts lots of money i would invest in ethnic identity and i would establish the cult of victimology i would get all minorities to think that their lack of success was the fault of the majority i would start a grievance industry blaming all minority failure on the majority population
7496841 my sixth plan for americas downfall would include dual citizenship and promote divided loyalties
7496842 next to last i would place all subjects off limits make it taboo to talk about anything against the cult of diversity i would find a word similar to heretic of the 16th century that stopped discussion and paralyzed thinking words like racist or xenophobe halt discussion and debate having made america a bilingual bicultural country having established multi culturism having the large foundations fund the doctrine of victimology i would next make it impossible to enforce our immigration laws i would develop a mantra that because immigration has been good for america it must always be good i would make every individual immigrant symmetric and ignore the cumulative impact of millions of them

7496970 you can put stress on a defense by lining up fast and then you can make your calls were lined up we can look around see whats going on and then we still have a little bit of time to make the call and get the snap off
7496971 i think were going to see a few less plays

7497004 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7497005 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
7497006 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
7497007 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7497008 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines
7497009 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7497010 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
7497011 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
7497012 developing and using new corn hybrids with improved tolerance to drought and other stresses is important and a viable water saving approach
7497013 thats up about 10 a hundredweight compared to last year
7497014 i go to oregon to the willamette valley every year to look at various varieties that i have released to make sure that they are being increased and with good care so that we know we are having high quality seed coming back to texas
7497015 they are having to ship that either by rail or by semi from oregon so that makes it a lot more expensive
7497016 where they can they will ship it by train railroad car and thats not too bad because the prices are pretty good there if they have to ship by semi then it is probably another 5 or 6 a hundredweight
7497017 theyll lose about 30 days of grazing but they will offset winter feeding costs and the clover will provide n nitrogen for the warm season grasses the next summer
7497018 i wish we had some easy formula for folks that would help them make these choices
7497019 but the truth is every operation is different and each producer has different expectations theyre going to have to make their choices based on how much risk theyre willing to take
7497020 change the landscape of food safety in the nation forever
7497021 each year 15 20 people die and countless others are hospitalized in the u s as a result of consuming fresh produce contaminated with food borne pathogens such as e coli
7497022 everyone involved with produce from the field to the plate must use the best agricultural and food preparation practices
7497023 electron beam irradiation or ebeam is an emerging technology that offers the potential to significantly enhance the level of safety of complex food items such as fruits and vegetables
7497024 theyre not a get out of jail card theyre not a silver bullet but they do offer some valuable alternatives to high cost nitrogen
7497025 a healthy stand of arrowleaf or crimson clover over seeded on warm season perennial grass pasture in east texas will provide a nitrogen input of up to 100 pounds of nitrogen per acre per year
7497026 however this is only accomplished through a grazing system with the recycling of animal waste youve got to be thinking in terms of recycling through animal grazing
7497027 clover will not directly provide nitrogen for the ryegrass in a ryegrass clover mixture it will provide nitrogen to the warm season grass that comes later through recycling
7497028 the clover rhizobium symbiosis is regulated by the amount of nitrogen available in the soil
7497029 the sandy acid soils of east texas are low in soil nitrogen but soil nitrogen increases if nitrogen fertilizer is applied if a clover ryegrass mix is planted and fertilized then the nitrogen fixation process will be slowed or turned off the ryegrass will do great but the clover will not contribute very much to the mix
7497030 this will give the early advantage to the clover which will start fixing nitrogen
7497031 a low rate of n 50 to 60 pounds per acre can be applied to the clover ryegrass mix in late december or january this will increase the ryegrass growth and allow the mix to efficiently fix and use nitrogen
7497032 bloat can be a problem but it is not limited to clovers
7497033 any fast growing cool season forage ryegrass wheat clover can cause bloat

7497114 earlier in the year we had a nationwide race and kyle was a lot faster than me
7497115 he got to my back bumper and just smoked the back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack after that he said sorry man my car was just faster so in my mind i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just give him a little tap and see what happens so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made and you know id do it again
7497116 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now
7497117 hes mad and i can completely empathise with his anger i probably would have done the exact same thing

7497125 the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys purring creations
7497126 would usually smile and nod and say that i understood the skepticism but that there was and always had been another tradition to politics a tradition based on the simple idea that we have a stake in one another and that what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart and that if enough people believe in the truth of that proposition and act on it then we might not solve every problem but we can get something meaningful done
7497127 enough of them appreciated my earnestness and youthful swagger that i made it to the illinois legislature
7497128 s ome of the problems include printing registered voters name sic instead of writing a female voter got married after she registered to vote and signed her maiden name registered voters signed the petitions but dont live in the 13th district
7497129 the fundamental piece of all of that discussion is an acknowledgement that those stair towers belong to the people of newfoundland and labrador
7497130 right now the stair towers are being held hostage in marystown
7497131 the bottom line is that that piece of infrastructure clearly belongs to the bull arm site and government is absolutely adamant that it be returned to the bull arm site
7497132 we wouldnt want to see work lost in an area either in bull arm or in marystown because of the stair towers where that project terra nova goes is going to be very important in determining what the next steps are
7497133 were certainly open to discussion if marystown is successful in the bid to talk about new terms for the return of the stair towers
7497134 if marystown is successful on the terra nova project when that project is complete theres no question that those towers will be returned to bull arm unless some alternate arrangement that is acceptable to the bull arm corporation and government and the communities in this area is arrived at
7497135 they were very generous in supporting the towers going into marystown to keep jobs in marystown
7497136 but now the job is done and its time for the towers to come back
7497137 the communities would never have allowed them to leave if we ever thought we would arrive at this
7497138 its a good deal for the province and a good deal for our area of the province especially
7497139 we know what hibernia meant to the area and this is going to be a second hibernia
7497140 for a period of four or five years during the construction phase there was a lot of money being generated it meant something to clarenville as far as real estate and housing was concerned but it didnt add any great amount to the population
7497141 i dont anticipate a big influx of people to live in clarenville
7497142 what we had last time was a small number of people come in which was good we didnt have a real big boom and when it was over we didnt have that bust aspect to deal with and if the same thing can happen with hebron then its all the better for us
7497143 even before the announcement on hebron weve had a tremendous increase in housing prices in the last year in the clarenville area
7497144 i would say the prices in clarenville have gone up between 10 and 20 percent
7497145 not everyone in clarenville is going to be able to afford to pay a quarter of a million dollars or 200 000 for a house
7497146 four or five years ago you could buy a house in clarenville for 100 000 and now 150 000 is not a big sum for a house and thats your average sized bungalow
7497147 i dont know how you do it but its a social problem that comes with big economic activity its been recognized worldwide that given an economic activity the size of hebron you know theres going to be big wages but those big wages cant extend to everyone
7497148 you always have to keep in your mind theres another segment of the population thats going to be earning the same as they were two or three years ago
7497149 our street system might need some major work done on it if traffic increases
7497150 and you still have the refinery in come by chance which is adding significantly to the area

7497153 leader of a faction in the u s conference of catholic bishops that believes catholic voters should judge political candidates primarily by their views on abortion
7497154 has been savaged by conservative catholics for refusing to bar pro choice catholics such as u s sen john kerry and house speaker nancy pelosi from the communion rail
7497155 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think
7497156 he or she could come to believe that up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
7497157 is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
7497158 there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
7497159 crops which have been genetically engineered to date include maize soya beans canola derived from rapeseed and potatoes many biotech companies would like to genetically engineer wheat if this is pushed through the question will arise as to whether gm wheat can be used in the eucharist
7497160 the bread must be wheaten only and recently made so that there is no danger of corruption
7497161 for example people who suffer coeliac disease are unable to absorb gluten a protein found in wheat eating even small amounts of wheat can make them ill
7497162 in recent decades it has been possible to extract the gluten from wheaten bread so that people can eat bread without endangering their health despite the fact that gluten wheat poses a health threat which can often be serious the congregation of the doctrine of the faith stated in a reply in 1982 that the local ordinary could not permit a priest to consecrate special gluten free hosts for the communion of coeliacs
7497163 special hosts quibus glutinum ablatum est from which gluten has been removed are invalid matter for the celebration of the eucharist
7497164 given the centrality of the celebration of the eucharist in the life of the priest candidates for the priesthood who are affected by coeliac disease or suffer from alcoholism or similar conditions may not be admitted to holy orders
7497165 genetically engineered wheat will have an added protein which will make it tolerant to the herbicide of a biotech company
7497166 this raises questions whether it is lawful to use gm wheat as matter for the eucharist if notwithstanding a pressing health need the congregation of the doctrine of the faith refused to sanction gluten free hosts as valid matter for the eucharist because a protein has been extracted from the wheat how can it sanction genetically engineered wheat which has an added protein designed to make it resistant to a weed killer
7497167 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer

7497413 for many retirement is seen as the ultimate finish line a nirvana at the end of a long life of work
7497414 very few people would have the strength to walk away from 3 billion to maintain a companys culture
7497415 the case highlights some interesting tensions and conflicts in the private equity business between generating wealth for the firms investment professionals via the fee stream which is strictly a function of how many dollars you manage and the investors in the firm the so called limited partners who make money only when the firm makes good investments and generates superior returns
7497416 you would think either we could hire more people to generate more ideas or we could pursue auction deals it takes time though to develop experience in this space and i dont think we could hire enough people to develop ideas to invest all 4 billion to match talent and fund size we would have to enter more auctions
7497417 very few people would have the strength to walk away from 3 billion to maintain a companys culture
7497418 when i was a student in the 1980s im sure the whole class would have said to absolutely take the 4 billion
7497419 the course does a good job of highlighting the conflicts that are inherent in this business such as the tension between investment professionals and their investors
7497420 it trains our students to think analytically and fairly about conflict as opposed to pretending it doesnt exist
7497421 why is there very little marketing of this platform or associated business solutions
7497422 i feel like im moving in slow motion and everything around me is moving so fast and i just want to go back to when things were normal when i wasnt poor izzie laying on the bathroom floor in her prom dress with her her dead fiancee but i am so i cant and im just stuck and theres all this pressure cause everyones hovering around waiting for me to do something or say something or flip out or yell or cry some more and im happy to play my part im happy to say the lines and do whatever it is im supposed to be doing if it would make everyone feel more comfortable but i dont i dont know how to do this i dont know how to be this person i dont know who this person is
7497423 you listen to the ones who were concerned with what lyndon johnson did on the domestic side and you say there never was a surer touch
7497424 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7497425 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7497426 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7497427 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7497428 began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964
7497429 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7497430 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7497431 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7497432 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7497433 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7497434 the sense of that seems to be very much lost
7497435 business is very well at the moment and beyond expectations
7497436 we are happy with the progress we have made in the past four years and are not shy to invest here this is a strategic market and we are therefore taking a long term view of our investment
7497437 even more matured than automotive markets in the developed countries
7497438 the south african market is made more complicated by the fact you have more than 60 brands brand loyalty has been a big challenge for us
7497439 we have attractive value for money propositions both for fare paying passengers looking to switch from more fuel intensive car and air journeys and for public authorities as they increasingly acknowledge the proven financial benefits of private sector service delivery

7497441 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
7497442 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
7497443 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
7497444 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
7497445 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
7497446 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
7497447 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
7497448 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
7497449 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
7497450 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
7497451 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
7497452 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
7497453 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
7497454 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
7497455 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
7497456 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
7497457 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
7497458 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
7497459 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
7497460 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
7497461 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
7497462 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
7497463 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
7497464 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
7497465 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
7497466 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
7497467 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
7497468 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
7497469 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
7497470 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
7497471 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
7497472 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
7497473 yah sabar saja mi memang rasa keakuan itu terusik kalo kita sedang merokok ditegur
7497474 the class of 2010 is going to expose more locals at this position that colleges are already locked onto
7497475 here is yet another young man who can beat you with his legs or his arm
7497476 i note that there has been at least one attempt to express frbr in rdf and that they have not defined expression as a subclass of work
7497477 i would think it would be rather more likely that a user would search for a particular work using its author and title and expect to see all of its expressions and manifestations displayed so that the user could browse through them and make a selection
7497478 also the manifestation by itself would be rather meaningless and hard to identify for the user without the author and title of the work contained the language of the expression contained etc
7497479 every item is also a manifestation an expression and a work
7497480 the frbr model itself seems to assume a hierarchy and some level of inheritance from the work to the expression and manifestation this is evidenced by the application of topical subjects only to the work presumably this does not mean that manifestations have no subjects associated with them but that they inherit them from the work
7497481 does the report actually say that explicitly or is that just how some in the library world read it
7497482 id say that the manifestation embodies some textual expression of a work that has topics x y z the topics are linked at the work level and it shouldnt be any more complicated than that
7497483 do you follow me here on the implications of subclassing in rdf and why i think the existing frbr in rdf work has it right
7497484 well i can grok that but we still need some kind of workable relationship between the manifestation and the work and i do think that if you look at the attributes in frbr youll find inconsistencies in what you can assume about the relationships between the different levels
7497485 treating simple properties like titles as full resources is modeling overkill in my view
7497486 if and when obama towel head gets elected i will blow his fucking head off
7497487 per fare silenzio mentale e accogliere nuove note e nuove sinfonie

7497490 public transport can offer a more cost effective option than the car is better for the environment and can be a lot less stressful removing the frustration associated with the daily commute by car
7497491 our patrol officers have adjusted patrols and are scouring the area for the suspect and we are working collaboratively with the durham police department
7497492 the tone of the book is mangum tries to explain how she ended up in the house that night
7497493 it really is an abject lesson for young women not to make the same mistakes that she made
7497494 the only definitive account of the life and struggles of the woman at the center of the duke lacrosse case the alleged accuser were it not for the duke lacrosse case she likely would be described as a bright young woman from durham n c who has had a difficult life
7497495 if this book comes out and she doesnt admit she lied then it would be my advice to them to make sure she doesnt ever make one single penny off of it
7497496 i look at you young men and women as rainbows in the clouds
7497497 you have the courage to light the path for someone else who might not look like you or who might speak another language
7497498 somebody is going to help us resolve this problem with breast cancer
7497499 someone is going to help us find the solution to prostate cancer somebody is going to help us find a way to be good neighbors in south america so i want to encourage you to see who you are and where you are where you belong and who belongs to you
7497500 go to a teacher introduce yourselves you are here with a passion with a calling
7497501 everything she was saying felt like it was just for me everything she said was just what i was hoping to get out of duke
7497502 im not too worried about the first day of classes and i dont think my mom would be either
7497503 as long as i got to class fully aware shes ok
7497504 we want and expect freshmen to get to know upperclassmen and get to know durham as well
7497505 we hope that they make appropriate choices but they are adults
7497506 orientation is a good way to get used to the college social life before classes actually start
7497507 we have foam and a bull this is a safe haven
7497508 the night before classes started last year i was in bed watching greys anatomy
7497509 were so hyped about it the upperclassmen are amazing and most of the time theyre here and we really like to dance no joke
7497510 over the past three days ive had at least four to five people get sick not from alcohol
7497511 all of them have either eaten at the marketplace or i know one or two got sick from the convocation lunch outside the chapel
7497512 anything that was associated with the picnic we did a check up on
7497513 the food was stored in a refrigerated truck up until 45 minutes before the picnic at most the temperature of the sandwiches might have gone up a couple of degrees nothing that relates to the picnic has been identified as an issue
7497514 you can be in washington for years and not have it be worth a damn hes not presidential candidate john mccain just sitting there in washington
7497515 it confirms the overarching narrative that has been discussed in the media that barack obama saw a shortcoming in his own experience and qualification to be president and expects biden to compensate for them
7497516 i really think its going to come down to the mccain pick for his vice president
7497517 experience teaches you to recognize a mistake when youve made it again
7497518 ever since weve been here weve always had that target on our back
7497519 weve always been preseason no 1 since weve been freshmen and duke is the team that everyone wants to beat and everyone brings their a game for
7497520 but i think because were no 3 this year people will take us for granted hopefully
7497521 there are a lot of opportunities out there for players that have been here as well as our freshman
7497522 there are some holes to be filled and i think people are really working to gain that opportunity
7497523 were always so close to the sweet sixteen every year
7497524 tutto quello che dici passa al microscopio e in molti casi viene male interpretato
7497525 i cant understand this the difference between us is like night and day
7497526 oh green beans when she was upset it didnt work
7497527 questo fenomeno di aumento dellindebitamento delle famiglie avvenuto in modo molto sano afferma il direttore generale di intesa sanpaolo le famiglie che hanno accresciuto il loro debito se guardiamo le statistiche sono quelle in cui i capifamiglia sono dotati pi della media di attivit finanziarie e hanno un titolo di studio al di sopra della media
7497528 we came in our freshman year when the team was ranked first in the country
7497529 that was pretty intimidating coming in as a freshman and seeing that we had six seniors and five of them were all americans and just kind of on a different level getting to see that day in and day out was an inspiration and how much fun they were having and how driven they were
7497530 i feel like that same kind of momentum is back with us we have a great group of older girls and a great group of freshmen that just seem very excited about where were at and having fun everyone is pretty inspired to do the things day in and day out to see what we can do
7497531 last year we had on an individual level a lot of athletes have great breakthroughs and have high levels of performance
7497532 we return our entire group of leaders from the previous year so we feel that were a group that is ready for a pretty major step forward from where we were last year and i certainly think that we have the potential to be right where we were competition wise as two to three years ago our goals are pretty high since were coming off a season with great positive momentum
7497533 weve always been a very very good defensive team weve always been very solid in the goal
7497534 we put redmond in an attacking midfield position so she could face up and really run at players
7497535 elisabeth is running at defenders well shes drawing defenders out of shape she can score from distance and she can play other players in
7497536 we are a lot stronger than we were last year
7497537 we have that goal scoring mentality obviously this wasnt the toughest test well have but i think well be able to bring it in games down the road
7497538 i just wanted to come out and play my hardest and make a first tackle
7497539 i dont tend to score a lot so it was exciting it was a new experience
7497540 this is how duke soccer is and this is our tradition hopefully well keep it up for the rest of the year
7497541 i have been fortunate to have been involved in many olympics
7497542 beyond the competitive drama every olympics provides a snapshot of a city and a country at a point and time this one was more compelling than most since chinas rise and its ongoing transformation is the global story not only of the moment but likely of the foreseeable future
7497543 no advanced degree in international relations is required to appreciate the genuine warmth of the chinese people the honest pride in their country and how seriously chinese citizens from famous olympians to everyday men and women took this chance to show themselves to the world
7497544 it was clear what was at issue here from the outset the very first drumbeats at the opening ceremony on aug 8 serving notice of chinas arrival among the front ranks of the nations of the world a station chinese athletes emphatically underscored over the next two weeks their performance topping the gold medal chart with 51
7497545 successive editions of the olympics are sure to be measured
7497546 the venues were first rate several architectural marvels the buses ran on time pollution related concerns ultimately played no part in the sports schedule
7497547 the striking success of the olympics on burnishing chinas prestige as the world admired its sporting prowess organizational skills and dramatically modern urban landscapes could encourage profound changes in the country
7497548 the thousands of blue shirted volunteers could not have been more friendly polite and welcoming even when as was frequently the case the language barrier proved formidable
7497549 have a computer problem three volunteers descended in five minutes to solve it arrive at a venue without an umbrella on a rainy day volunteers requested you wait on the bus until they found one
7497550 i think it just said that even though we finished where we finished it just is not acceptable for our program
7497551 everyone made a commitment then and there to change things so that they would never have to experience that again
7497552 were far ahead of where weve been in any other year the way were playing and what weve been doing on the field
7497553 one of the great things about this years team is that we dont settle with mediocrity
7497554 we demand a lot out of each other both on and off the field i think thats hard to find in a lot of teams and in the past two weeks weve set the bar very high for the rest of the season as to what we expect out of each other and i think that we can meet those expectations if we stay on the track that we are on right now
7497555 were very excited about the young people on our team but the key with our team as with most athletic endeavors is going to be our leadership from our seniors
7497556 with the combination of strong upperclassmen leadership and real strong freshmen and sophomore classes we think that we can rejoin what has become the top three in recent years in the acc florida state n c state and virginia
7497557 we feel that we are ready to join that group and make it an elite four
7497558 i think that all four teams can qualify for the ncaa championships were fired up and cant wait to start competing
7497559 in the example of boxun it releases broken news important or not so important every day with more and more pictures and videos
7497560 many incidents are now exposed on internet first then the official news release follows
7497561 we didnt come out with the same bite in the second half and we allowed them to get back in the game it was a good lesson for our guys to make sure that were not taking things lightly at the start of the second half
7497562 overall our performance was solid and it improved on our performance against greensboro so im happy with that
7497563 sono felicissimo di essere qui le poche parole rilasciate alla stampa dallattaccante ucraino in queste ore per me cos speciali voglio rivolgere un saluto anche ai tifosi del chelsea che negli ultimi due anni mi hanno sempre fatto sentire il loro supporto grazie davvero per questo

7497573 such networking lets us deal with the gang situation here so we can minimize it the elimination of the gang problems a community thing
7497574 we have to make gangs as reprehensible as white supremacy groups kkk skinheads nazis and i put gangs on the same plateau as them
7497575 this new law helps make sure we target our resources to effectively cut down on the number of young people who are susceptible to getting involved with gangs
7497576 the former president is disappointed associates said because he is eager to speak about the economy and more broadly about democratic ideas emphasizing the contrast between the bush years and his own record in the 1990s
7497577 this is an especially sore point for bill clinton people close to him say because among many grievances he has about the campaign obama waged against his wife is a belief that the candidate poor mouthed the political and policy successes of his two terms
7497578 im a proud hillary clinton democrat she had the experience and judgment to be president now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its okay really

7497583 soccer is not a spectator sport its a participation sport
7497584 you dont wait for a basehit or a first down to get into it instead of waiting to yell charge after a horn blows you are engaged for a full 90 minutes of people trying to pick up the team themselves and the people around them
7497585 its real important for us to make as many efforts as we can to reach out to our fan base
7497586 we already have 5 000 seat depositors who have no idea what its going to cost no idea where their seats are going to be no idea whos on the team
7497587 for them to give us that kind of commitment weve got to step out and do things in response

7497607 we are working day and night and well but since the process started it has become more difficult than we expected due to the bad state of some of the dna samples

7497625 recreate 68 has dedicated itself to a vain attempt to turn this years democratic national convention in denver into a simulacrum of the notorious 1968 chicago convention when mayor richard daleys cops busted the heads of anti war protesters in the streets
7497626 recreate 68 will be any more successful than the 30th anniversary re enactment of woodstock which notoriously resulted in at least four reported rapes
7497627 recreate 68 colleagues might turn the streets of denver into a scene of revolution pseudo radicals like spagnulo lack even the self awareness to realize that their talk of revolution is as bogus as the convention theyre protesting

7497631 the rajasthan police were seeking a transit remand to carry him to jaipur for trial
7497632 while he was suspected to be having close links with the banned simi a final confirmation would be made only by the rajasthan cops who were interrogating him
7497633 he has been around for quite some time and we cannot not even remotely imagine that he could be involved in any kind of terrorist activities

7497667 the university of alaska anchorage released a report that valuated the state s election system in detail and recommended ways to strengthen the technology and election procedures
7497668 seals that would reveal tampering should be used on all voting equipment election security information should be added to poll workers training manuals there should be increased vigilance about security procedures at absentee polling places and state owned voting machines should be used in the north slope borough rather than borrowing borough owned machines
7497669 that tamper evident seals have been placed on all equipment

7497677 given the similar missions of the fralin biotechnology center and the institute for biomedical and public health sciences we decided that a single entity could be managed more effectively and efficiently towards that end we have been fortunate to bring tracey talley schroeder on board as our associate director for administration and finance
7497678 her experience during the early stages of two large highly successful institutes the virginia tech transportation institute and the virginia bioinformatics institute and during the merger of three organizations which became the institute for policy and governance will be a valuable resource for the successful implementation of this merger and growth of the fralin life science institute
7497679 we will be very careful to preserve the original mission of the fralin biotechnology center
7497680 for example our strong commitment to public service in the area of biotechnology and undergraduate education with particular emphasis on research opportunities for undergraduate students will remain intact the merger with the institute for biomedical and public health sciences will also permit us to use the fralin institute as a broad investment vehicle for promoting interdisciplinary research in life science with a special focus on biomedical sciences
7497681 our specific mission will involve partnering with the universitys colleges and departments as a way to augment faculty member and graduate student recruitment and to promote team science we expect equipment infrastructure investments to serve as interdisciplinary research incubators that are closely tied to faculty recruitment and graduate student training we also plan to promote interdisciplinary research through recognition of established faculty that are already engaged in team science and will accomplish this by implementation of a fralin institute senior fellow program
7497682 we already have a cache of outstanding faculty in vector borne disease research who have been extraordinarily successful now is the time to push to the highest level possible
7497683 these hires will end this phase of aggressive institute investment and we will then focus our primary faculty recruitment efforts in other areas such as researchers that study metabolic syndromes for which virginia tech also already has an emerging strength of course we also recognize and will continue to support our established strengths in molecular plant sciences and infectious diseases
7497684 aggressive investment in targeted areas will have the biggest impact last year the institute for biomedical and public health sciences partnered with the college of veterinary medicine and leveraged commonwealth research initiative funds to help bring three outstanding researchers to blacksburg and to retain one of our star scientists within the life sciences
7497685 we will help bring students to campus and help support some of the most competitive students through fralin institute graduate stipends
7497686 roop mahajan director of ictas and i already work together on a daily basis as we are responsible for implementation of the virginia tech carilion medical research institute we share the same vision for broadly promoting interdisciplinary research throughout the university i also expect to work cooperatively with the institute of society culture and environment isce and with virginia bioinformatics institute vbi for example vbi and fralin will jointly invest in faculty members that need to use expensive equipment to generate new data for preparation of new research proposals

7497722 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7497723 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7497724 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7497725 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7497749 well grounded in the love and minutiae of sci fi and fantasy adventure
7497750 john kenneth muirs books for mcfarland are distinctive because of their authority and effective research

7497765 a pesar de que han hecho la mayor contribuci n al desarrollo sus vidas son tristes sin dinero sin un trato justo y sin acceso al poder
7497766 fue el comienzo de una nueva era la de los blogs como medio de comunicaci n de la gente corriente
7497767 pero en china los blogs y los medios de comunicaci n cumplen una funci n diferente porque la prensa oficial tiene muchos l mites los periodistas no son libres para hablar y deben seguir las instrucciones de las autoridades
7497768 pero en general yo escribo de lo que quiero a veces eso s debo cuidar el lenguaje para no convertir un asunto en algo demasiado sensible

7497772 tenemos una larga tradici n de gente que trata de encajar con el grupo que moderan su comportamiento para evitar destacar ser visibles una cultura reforzada por el colectivismo impuesto durante el pasado medio siglo

7497828 ese proyecto ha dormido el sue o de los justos ante el desinter s mostrado por el cabildo insular gomera y por el anterior equipo local de gobierno presidido por el anterior alcalde de hermigua y entonces a su vez diputado regional jos ram n mora
7497829 que el vicepresidente del cabildo natural de hermigua padece del llamado s ndrome del despacho y que sin salir de l ni estar en contacto con las realidades municipales pretende conocer m s que nadie de los distintos y m ltiples problemas que aquejan a la isla si quiere saber algo de lo que pasa en su isla deber a salir de ese buen despacho del que goza en el edificio del cabildo insular y darse unas vueltas y visitar con car cter oficial cosa que nunca ha hecho a los seis alcaldes para que conozca in situ las necesidades m s perentorias a cubrir por la primera instituci n insular
7497830 se ha pedido por activa y por pasiva el listado de inversiones municipalizado de los ltimos mandatos para comprobar la equidad y necesidad de las inversiones cabildicias pero todav a estoy esperando por l sistema que utilizan con car cter sistem tico para mantenernos desinformados pero si nos atenemos a la informaci n contenida en un libreto de la pasada campa a electoral del se or curbelo pagada con dinero p blico el cabildo de la gomera habr a invertido cero euros de sus fondos propios en el municipio de hermigua
7497831 para tener autoridad tica y moral sobre los ayuntamientos de la isla una de las obligaciones ineludibles del cabildo de la gomera es el reparto equilibrado a lo largo del tiempo de las inversiones de la primera instituci n insular teniendo en cuenta que ha de apoyarse m s si cabe a las zonas infradesarrolladas o desfavorecidas para posibilitar con ello no s lo la fijaci n de la poblaci n sino un desarrollo arm nico del conjunto insular

7497866 ho assistito a una deplorevole scena di crudelt gratuita commenta un testimone i vigili urbani hanno trascinato e strattonato un ragazzo di colore perch non era in possesso della licenza alcuni miei amici hanno scattato delle foto con il cellulare i vigili urbani inutile che cerchino giustificazioni poich non vero come affermano che lambulante ha avuto una reazione eccessiva e che li ha autorizzati ad usare violenza nei suoi confronti ero presente ai fatti e ho ancora nelle orecchie la voce e il pianto dellextracomunitario che supplicava
7497867 non so nulla ero in ferie sto apprendendo ora quanto successo una cosa per certa se i vigili hanno agito in quel modo perch evidentemente c stata una reazione spropositata del giovane le regole in qualche modo le dobbiamo fare rispettare capisco che certe scene possono apparire pi o meno cruente ma dipende dalla reazione del soggetto

7497870 i want to remember him in his days of just undiluted glory
7497871 you listen to the ones who were concerned with what lyndon johnson did on the domestic side and you say there never was a surer touch
7497872 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7497873 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7497874 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7497875 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7497876 began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964
7497877 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7497878 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7497879 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7497880 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7497881 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7497882 the sense of that seems to be very much lost
7497883 i will have to answer that for myself before i can answer it for you

7498197 it does present some problems when you have a mobile quarterback who can decide when to run and when to make a play with his arm

7498261 he needs to get people to know more about what he stands for weve seen no gains over the last six months in what people know about his policy positions on the economy and foreign policy and he needs to remind people that hes the democrat and that john mccain is the republican candidate who is in the same party as president bush
7498262 the convention is a great opportunity for him to come in and tell the american people that hell turn the economy around and do it in a way that makes people understand that this guy gets it
7498263 its also an opportunity to make a comparative contrast against the republicans particularly after eight years of mishandling everything they had anything to do with

7498271 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7498272 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill

7498278 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7498279 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7498280 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip

7498306 hes had a fantastic start hes gone out there wanting the captaincy and already hes making really good decisions
7498307 hopefully he will go from strength to strength hes learning all the time
7498308 hes done a great job so far and i hope he continues with that
7498309 i just found the captaincy was added responsibility which was very draining
7498310 the thing was it was taking the form away in test cricket and that was the last thing i wanted it to do
7498311 its great coming back into the ranks and concentrating on your own job

7498318 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7498319 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7498320 mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put that would not be a fair reflection the government is instead following the steps it said it would take in the wake of the referendum outcome
7498321 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu
7498322 we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7498323 in the view of the other member states we will be preventing the eu from equipping itself to deal with the many political and economic challenges facing todays europe
7498324 not an inch is not a policy that has much to commend it in a dynamic europe that wants to move forward
7498325 we have to explore all possible solutions we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage

7498329 hay que arrimar el hombro no se trata de hacer oposici n oportunista y destructiva cuando el pa s necesita que su gobierno ponga en marcha un presupuesto como el que la situaci n econ mica reclama
7498330 no ser a comprensible que se entiendan en este contexto de crisis los sindicatos y los empresarios y no lo hagan los partidos pol ticos
7498331 se puede hacer un par ntesis entendiendo que hay buena voluntad y camino de negociaci n del modelo de financiaci n y previamente aprobar el presupuesto

7498345 pi foce di umani atti consunti dimpallidite vite tramontanti oltre il confine che a cerchio ci rinchiude visi emunti mani scarne cavalli in fila ruote stridule vite no vegetazioni
7498346 una risacca di memorie giunge al vostro cuore e quasi lo sommerge
7498347 parli e non riconosci i tuoi accenti la memoria ti appare dilavata sei passata e pur senti la tua vita consumata
7498348 e forse tutto fisso tutto scritto e non vedremo sorgere per via la libert il miracolo il fatto che non era necessario
7498349 un ondulamento sovverte forme confini resi astratti ogni forza decisa gi diverte dal cammino la vita cresce a scatti come un fal senza fuoco che si preparava per chiari segni in questo lume il nostro si fa fioco
7498350 un astrale delirio si disfrena un male calmo e lucente forse vedremo lora che rasserena venirci incontro sulla spera ardente
7498351 a lei tendo la mano e farsi mia unaltra vita sento ingombro duna forma che mi fu tolta e quasi anelli alle dita non foglie mi si attorcono ma capelli poi pi nulla
7498352 nulla di te nel vacillar dellore bige o squarciate da un vampo di solfo fuori che il fischio del rimorchiatore che dalle brume approda al golfo
7498353 nel meriggio afoso spunta la barca di salvezza giunta vedila che sciaborda tra le secche esprime un suo burchiello che si volge al docile frangente e l ci attende
7498354 cos forse anche ai morti tolto ogni riposo nelle zolle una forza indi li tragge spietata pi del vivere ed i mozzi loro voli ci sfiorano pur ora da noi divisi appena e nel crivello del mare si sommergono
7498355 tra i fili che congiungono un ramo allaltro si dibatte il cuore come la gallinella di mare che sinsacca tra le maglie e immobili e vaganti ci ritiene una fissit gelida
7498356 mapparite allora come me nel limbo squallido delle monche esistenze
7498357 inevitabile sar allora per il poeta trovare in quella fissit gelida unanalogia fra la sua voce irretita in un discorso poetico che non sa pi inventare e liberarsi e le anime dei morti che su quella stessa prode si aggirano inquiete indecise fra la vita che non vissero forse del tutto e il definitivo distacco verso cieli superni che non ancora avvenuto
7498358 i morti rivisitano la terra e si ritrovano carichi delle antiche inquietudini
7498359 i possibili emblemi che il poeta pu ora offrire alla sua ispiratrice non sono quelli felici e ardui di un tempo che nascevano dalla incisiva naturalezza della mente poetica dal suo metaforico straniamento ma piuttosto i nomi reali i segni di una muta tensione che evolve ormai verso altro
7498360 il tu delle mie poesie non mai rivolto a me stesso un tu istituzionale lantagonista che bisognerebbe inventare se non ci fosse il tu di casa sul mare e di crisalide indirizzato a una donna splendida era stata attrice e tutti quelli che lavvicinavano se ne innamoravano era sposata con un uomo debole indifeso andarono in sud america da allora non ho pi saputo nella di lei
7498361 anche la persona a cui si dice voi un essere parallelo nella sorte dinfecondit il credito trasferito in altrui di felicit ossia possibilit deccezione ha allora un aspetto dipotesi provvisoria la poesia anche quella di montale non tollera ipotesi ma solo levidenza dei miracoli
7498362 linterlocutore non ha pi n ieri n domani cio nelleterno come in
7498363 la sempre tenace sortita del discorso dal suo presente immoto e come congelato e il suo aggancio a un diverso spazio interiore di memoria e di oggettivante durata qui ancora per molti lati allo stadio di proposta che conduca al di l dai mondi luoghi e tempi originari di questa poesia
7498364 soltanto una proclamazione di un dovere di dire di un messaggio che la poesia non pu non dichiarare e definire continuamente per intrinseca natura del dire poetico che di costruire e proclamare messaggi anche se non possono giungere effettivamente a nessuno e se lanima stessa di chi li pronuncia non pi forma ma caos e non pu di conseguenza sperare di ridare ordine e verit alla vita
7498365 questo gesto si pone come lunica forma di miracolo possibile la forma delloblazione in senso etimologico ob latio offerta di s dello scambio del proprio posto con quello di un altro dellaccettazione di un pi dolore e di condanna perch altri siano liberi
7498366 lipotesi religiosa avanzata qui dal poeta non si stacca da quelle contenute negli
7498367 in un caso limite si parte addirittura dalla vita misteriosa congetturabile per una sola traccia
7498368 un fantasma privilegiato come assoluta presenza dellignoto solo in delta in quel fischio di rimorchiatore che unico avanzo del segreto segue la citazione del passo e a rigore la prima lirica dun montale esplicito pienamente caratterizzato
7498369 il segreto di certi stupiti e polisillabici vocaboli montaliani la funicolare mottetto
7498370 anche la vostra rinascita uno sterile segreto un prodigio fallito come tutti quelli che ci fioriscono daccanto

7498414 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7498415 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7498416 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7498417 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7498418 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7498419 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7498420 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7498421 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7498422 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7498423 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7498424 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7498425 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7498426 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7498427 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7498428 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7498429 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7498430 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7498431 who are open to doing something on the production side
7498432 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7498433 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7498434 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7498435 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7498436 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7498437 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7498438 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7498439 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7498440 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7498441 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7498442 sometimes you sit next to him on the bench and say sheesh take it easy on him
7498443 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7498444 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7498445 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7498446 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7498447 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7498448 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7498449 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7498450 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7498451 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7498452 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7498453 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7498454 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7498455 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7498456 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7498457 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7498458 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7498459 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7498460 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7498461 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7498462 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7498463 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7498464 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7498465 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7498466 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7498467 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7498468 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7498469 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7498470 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7498471 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7498472 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7498473 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7498474 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7498475 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7498476 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7498477 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7498478 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7498479 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7498480 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7498481 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7498482 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7498483 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7498484 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7498485 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7498486 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7498487 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7498488 he thinks hes famous as jen now last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving
7498489 nice but no one bothered to follow them which made john think he lost everyone when really no one bothered to follow him
7498490 pictures of him and jen were selling for 20 000 at one point a picture of him alone gets 200 now chasing him from his apartment to nobu is hardly worth it
7498491 at the present time we arent experiencing a detrimental shortage of skilled workers quite the opposite actually
7498492 however looking at the future expansion of the industry paired with government investment ireland undoubtedly needs an increase of skilled graduates to realise the industrys full potential

7498504 with school starting just around the corner we want parents to know that our ministry assists parents who are considering homeschooling by providing a free dvd and brochure with information on why a home education in todays culture provides the best option for their childrens spiritual moral and academic training
7498505 to rescue their children loving parents need to find an alternative to government schools and every church needs to make it a priority to help parents be in charge of their childrens education again
7498506 we are very thankful for those individuals and organizations who have worked so diligently to protect and defend parental rights and the freedom to homeschool in california and the nation perhaps one way every homeschooling family can help perpetuate these freedoms is to enlighten and encourage other parents to investigate the blessings of home education

7498510 these two men need to stop acting like abortion is a game of political theater to treat abortion as they have both been doing over the last few days as a mere means of manipulating voters is not acceptable to americans but especially not to women abortion is no more a political tool today than slavery was 150 years ago todays paramount human rights issue the right to live is not a toy for political cynics they need to realize that americans care too much for women many of whom have suffered from abortions effects and babies to accept how these men have treated abortion unborn children deserve basic human rights and their struggling mothers need better options obama and mccain need to get serious
7498511 americans deserve better than this from their presidential candidates we are talking about real people here real women who are carrying real babies abortion is a horrific blot on our national honor and we need some real men with a backbone to stand up for them john mccain and barack obama need to get serious about this paramount issue dont leave all the tough battles for us women to fight come on guys get serious join us in fighting for life

7498564 i was extremely upset when i heard that they had burnt my effigies this is a sign of total disrespect in a democratic country like india i felt as if they were burning me though it hurt me i also felt silly about the entire thing was i really the cause of all this

7498597 i believe in separation of church and state and so does barack obama

7498600 senator obama is a committed christian and he believes that people of all faiths have an important place in american life
7498601 we are honored that so many religious leaders are reaching across partisan and ideological lines in this convention to address the values that matter to americans
7498602 some of his campaign literature makes george w bush look like a member of the aclu
7498603 there is a lot of alienation among evangelicals in the republican party people are more open to looking at obama
7498604 some people in the obama campaign are taking the views of pro lifers seriously
7498605 whether its because of conscience or electoral necessity they are doing something
7498606 we need to make sure we put faith in action we need to stay focused on the needs of people particularly the least of these our faith as christians calls us to

7498625 we are not banning anyone or kicking anyone out its about addressing truancy as a problem and the police and westpoint have discussed this measure as one way to cut truancy
7498626 the policy does absolutely nothing to solve a problem of truancy all it does is shift it from westpoint to elsewhere
7498627 why would you be in uniform if you were a truant anyway
7498628 we can either turn a blind eye to truantism or get involved and be part of the community
7498629 even if we can get one or two kids back to school that makes it worth it

7498638 epidemiological evidence has suggested a link between beta agonists and increases in asthma mortality
7498639 there has been much debate about possible causal links for this association and whether regular daily long acting beta 2 agonists are safe the aim of this review is to assess the risk of fatal and non fatal serious adverse events in trials that randomised patients with chronic asthma to regular salmeterol versus placebo or regular short acting beta 2 agonists
7498640 in comparison with placebo we have found an increased risk of serious adverse events with regular salmeterol
7498641 there is also a clear increase in risk of asthma related mortality in patients not using inhaled corticosteroids in the two large surveillance studies
7498642 although the increase in asthma related mortality was smaller in patients taking inhaled corticosteroids at baseline the confidence interval is wide so it cannot be concluded that the inhaled corticosteroids abolish the risks of regular salmeterol
7498643 the adverse effects of regular salmeterol in children remain uncertain due to the small number of children studied

7498670 as you can see reliability is the key and finishing and scoring points has got to be the goal for everyone
7498671 im not worried about the reliability of my car as you can tell
7498672 the past year and a half weve had phenomenal reliability and thats obviously due to the whole package that the whole team has put together and the engines great the car is great
7498673 we can focus on developing the car rather than worrying about reliability which is a bonus for us
7498674 well reliability is part of the consistency so if you have a single problem youre not consistent so the consistency is still the key for the championship
7498675 consistency means the performance the reliability and also the drivers so i think all these things are very important to the end of the season
7498676 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system

7498688 it was a very physical game and we did not get the result we wanted

7498705 two vaccines against cervical cancer are being widely used without sufficient evidence about whether they are worth their high cost or even whether they will effectively stop women from getting the disease
7498706 in developed countries pap smear screening and treatment have effectively reduced cervical cancer death rates to very low levels already there are 3 600 deaths annually from cervical cancer in the united states 1 000 in france and 400 in britain
7498707 i would have liked to see it go much slower
7498708 w ith their high price the vaccines are straining national and state health budgets as well as family pocketbooks these were the first vaccines approved for universal use in any age group that clearly cost the health system money rather than saved it in contrast to less expensive shots against measles and tetanus for example that pay for themselves by preventing costly diseases
7498709 looked at another way countries that pay for the vaccines will have less money available for other health needs
7498710 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
7498711 some of our provinces are running out of money to provide primary care

7498732 we saw that as soon as we dont play together as soon as we dont put our spirit together we can lose we have to put more heart in keep focused and play our football
7498733 i believe they wanted it a bit more than us in the first half when you want to play at the top you must start the game with the right attitude and personality fulham started stronger and were sharper the corner showed that we were not sharp enough the mistake we made on the corner is not excusable
7498734 when you lose a game the solution is not always to buy
7498735 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7498736 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7498737 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7498738 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7498739 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7498740 one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year
7498741 its going to be a tricky period household real income is very low that will make it difficult for households and there are difficult social issues that will arise
7498742 especially not really getting an opportunity to help the team whos to say if we had the opportunity to play it could be a different outcome in 04 thats one thing we did great in this tournament we used our bench thats the reason were better than everybody we dont got one or two guys weve got 12 guys who can play
7498743 then they come back and hit a three then we hit another three and they come back and hit two more threes and now its up four and and
7498744 im kind of crazy because im watching the whole game in my head again the intensity was unbelievable
7498745 we should be very proud of the effort we showed
7498746 tonight we shot 70 percent and were up by six
7498747 at one point i said youve got to be kidding me we wanted to play good defense and it was hard to do it spain executed they shot the ball they made big plays
7498748 and to be sitting in front of you guys tonight on top of the world i think we did a helluva job of putting americas basketball where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7498749 i would say already we can feel it that the young players want to be part of this
7498750 the first or second year stars players just drafted out of college agents are calling players are calling point is now that we have gotten it to this point we have a chance to take it to another level and that would be something that would be really important to u s basketball

7498826 mccains campaign is cheapening his greatest strength and making a mockery of his already dubious claim that hes reticent to talk about his pow experience by flashing the pow card to rebut any criticism no matter how unrelated
7498827 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7498828 spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation
7498829 will be prepared to show mccains home in hanoi by using images of his cell
7498830 theyre going to slice and dice the president and then theyre going to tie mccain to bush in the long run thats their best argument
7498831 i think going directly after mccain raises some danger because of the war hero issue
7498832 three in 10 say they support mr obama but have reservations about him or they support him only because he is the partys nominee
7498833 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket
7498834 the story here is more the obama not clinton ticket
7498835 if i were a hillary clinton supporter this morning id be scratching my head
7498836 right now i dont think theres any question that the clintons are wholeheartedly behind barack obama
7498837 were not going to shy away from making the contrast
7498838 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7498839 but in a tight race we cant afford to lose a small number hopefully obama will bring in enough new and first time voters to offset that
7498840 in case of violations see to it that said animals are destroyed
7498841 all who wish to avoid the suspicion of consciously obstructionist behaviour will use the hitler salute
7498842 invested every human encounter with magical fascination and helped to silence a nations moral scruples
7498843 robert come out to the living room we need to tell you something
7498844 from a pure strategic analysis its one of the few places where the democrats have a chance of rewriting the map
7498845 this area is transforming politically and whichever party figures it out better is going to have a good base for the next few decades
7498846 voters want people who are pragmatic who are solution oriented theyre not particularly partisan
7498847 i agree that colorado will be in play but not with the national thesis that this is a resurgence based on some new western ethos in the democratic party
7498848 this state has always been competitive we vote the way the country does almost all the time
7498849 both cultural and economic interests that are moderate to conservative
7498850 the republicans have been successful at mobilizing a certain amount of resentment over environmental programs and capitalizing on an anti washington bias thats important in some parts of the region
7498851 we dont look anything like the regular usa but somehow were the bellwether
7498852 weve got at least three states in one so were a real cross section
7498853 you have the libertarians and the party establishment the social conservatives the antitax crowd and the anti immigrant crowd all fighting it out

7498864 i significati dei dati ocse pisa citati litalia ultima in europa per la qualit della scuola probabilmente ci dipende anche dal fatto che siamo pressoch ultimi per quantit di finanziamenti attribuiti al settore

7498904 we are extremely grateful to macphie of glenbervie and j g ross bakers for taking on the challenge of developing a product for us
7498905 our initial testing of the bread indicates that it is very palatable and it has been well received by the consumers who have eaten it for a few weeks
7498906 the aim of the research is to develop new dietary strategies that could improve diabetes control we hope this could delay the need for people with type 2 diabetes to start taking tablets or insulin to control their blood sugar we also hope it could potentially reduce the risk of some of the complications of diabetes
7498907 this project exhibits strong and effective collaboration between academic research and industry to develop a practical solution to address a key health issue given our product development experience we understand that consumer needs are increasingly for healthy nutritious food products but also that these products have to deliver on taste and flavour if they are to be successful and this has been achieved in the recipe we have developed for the oat bread
7498908 as one of scotlands leading craft bakeries we are very keen to develop and introduce healthy and health enhancing products to supplement and compliment our range to provide our customers with tasty alternatives to our more traditional indulgent products
7498909 we are also planning to use this bread to develop sandwiches with a distinctively scottish flair initial feedback from the trials indicate that this bread is likely to become a firm favourite and not only with those looking to improve their blood sugar levels

7498967 the difference in this race might come down to temperament and character
7498968 i think thats what people want in a judge a person who can call the balls and strikes in an even handed manner
7498969 tool that has been devised to try to test the skills a certain student has at a certain time
7498970 this property appraiser doesnt know how to lower assessed values
7498971 i think its important to have continuity over the past eight years ive built a level of integrity and trust id hate to see that broken
7498972 it is exciting not to have to convince others to help
7498973 every piece of artwork that was in the show had to be from somewhere within winter haven
7498974 in fact the artist had to submit an address of where the scene was within the city
7498975 thats really unique not a lot of arts organizations do that
7498976 usually its a surprise until the opening reception night but its a really great learning experience for everybody involved as to why they made the decisions that they made
7498977 the athletes are eliminated before they get to the final running and then you have the winners then the judge selects the awards from the pieces that were accepted
7498978 its kind of interesting when the professionals meet the hobby painters
7498979 there are a lot of colors a lot of trees its sort of a traditional and an abstract in the same sense that shes abstract in a traditional art
7498980 like caulk you would use around your bathtub she used caulk to add some depth to the picture
7498981 ive always enjoyed having to stretch a little bit as an artist
7498982 we can no longer run the risk of anarchy committed against the united states of america by 11 and 3 year old girls who wantonly flaunt zoning regulations and sell fresh fruits and vegetables to the unsuspecting public
7498983 these children cannot be tolerated by a tolerant society they are taking away the jobs of illegal immigrants who harvest vegetables and only occasionally assault and murder people in the new economy we cant cut children any slack if they engage in commerce while legally living in this country it would be different if they were here illegally and were assaulting people we can look past that kind of stuff
7498984 these are children selling vegetables for gods sake its not like theyre dealing drugs or trying to kill somebody for crying out loud
7498985 we shelter criminals who are breaking the law by being here and we crush the business enterprise of some kids who might make fifty cents selling some tomatoes if this kind of logic keeps up people will start thinking that deposing a murderous dictator in iraq has the same moral equivalency as russia invading a peaceful democracy like the republic of georgia god help us
7498986 they said traffic was being stopped and then they came up with we cant have a roadside stand and then they said it was a commercial enterprise
7498987 they may start out with a little card table and selling a couple of things but then who is to say what else they have is all the produce made there do they make it themselves are they going to have eggs and chickens for sale next
7498988 how many of these people are there who were the beneficiaries of this process
7498989 this is what happens when the best intentions are misapplied
7498990 if there was any justification for this program cases like this certainly undermine that expectation these attacks demonstrate that these people are acting with impunity because they have little to fear
7498991 if you have any understanding of the nature of true crime youd know that harboring illegal murderers is nothing compared to allowing children to sell vegetables on street corners
7498992 if we allow kids to engage in commerce at these young ages theyll grow into corporate executives who make millions of dollars by creating new jobs and stimulating the economy the next thing you know theyll try to ban illegal workers from slipping across the countries borders and want barriers against foreigners who want to come here illegally and kill people they disagree with before you know it theyll even want to stop islamofascists from beheading infidels or free people who are subject to them the next thing you know theyll start voting republican we have to nip this stuff in the bud
7498993 when i was a young whipper snapper my grandfather had gone blind and couldnt do the chores like bring the cows up from the pasture or milk them so he had my cousins and myself as a captive audience
7498994 after the chores were done and the family had eaten supper grandfather would tell stories about how it was when he came here from milledgeville ga and his treks to get down here that just got me interested in history
7498995 i ran out of money and joined the army for three and half years came back home and got married
7498996 i got a job in the citrus industry for about 18 years and went to work for the united states department of agriculture for a while
7498997 the pallbearers take you away when it is time to leave the board
7498998 it really is a wonderful wonderful association one learns so much from the other people that are in it
7498999 we warmed up our fingers with e mails to county commissioners i get so mad about it that i might melt my headset and that is the honest to gods truth
7499000 the first story that i wrote was about young boys and a gator
7499001 i guess we plowden and his friends and relatives started swimming in lake hartridge on the northwest side of winter haven where the drive in theater used to be there is a city or county park there now off havendale boulevard we couldnt go swimming without supervision until we were about 10 years old there was big gator in the lake that came out in the late afternoon we being prudent young children watched him from the bank and didnt get in the water
7499002 about that time billy jim smith a neighbor who was watching the alligator go under the bridge came along
7499003 he just happened to swim where i was going to shoot my gun
7499004 when we were kids we were in the citrus groves like they all belonged to us
7499005 there was hardly a place we didnt go or at the winter haven municipal airport that we didnt play it didnt matter if we played in somebodys yard because we knew everyone when you were in mischief your mama knew about it when you got home even without phones out there we were mischievous but not destructive
7499006 but when the balls were soon lost we discovered the small green oranges off the trees like marbles could be hit with those paddles and sent a long way off
7499007 we were raised and told if you bit one of the seeds and swallowed it it would kill you
7499008 but we swallowed thousands of them they were round and oblong like an egg shape a little bigger than a grain of rice
7499009 he was really a neat person and was a pilot and instructor
7499010 at the end of wwii and the korean war he bought eight basic trainer airplanes called bt13s using two of the airplanes as parts and then fixing the rest up for sale the remaining parts created a bone yard in the south side of the airport
7499011 one afternoon johnson came down to the bone yard where were all flying
7499012 we climbed out of the pretend plane and thought we were in trouble but johnson said you know that was one of the best free three point landings i have ever seen how would you boys like to fly in a real airplane would we so he took us up in a real plane
7499013 after we had flown and were sitting in the pilot lounge in the hanger drinking cokes he bought us he said i want to ask you boys permission to do something a man has offered me a lot of money for your airplane and i wondered if you would let me sell it
7499014 we pushed our bicycles down the road as we walked them back home

7499016 the merger with grey wolf is a perfect strategic fit for both companies
7499017 together we can deliver high value services that will provide significant value to our customers employees and securityholders

7499031 so what are black conservatives conserving a fundamentalist shallow irresponsible agenda that i doubt will even acknowledge their worth as a human being as inherently valuable as their own the christian right does not see african americans as human beings but as a necessary pawn to forward their agenda african american conservatives must realize that the christian right is neither christian nor are they right
7499032 sources said merrill is looking for any event that might trigger a default on the loan and open the door to renegotiations

7499048 the parking and road improvements are all part of the ground work that needs to take place before the terminal expansion begins
7499049 the people that attended our event were people that really needed the extra help during the back to school season it was so rewarding to see that our community made a difference

7499054 neither b c nor any individual health authority is alone in its challenge to recruit and retain the number of physicians required to meet the growing demand for medical care over the coming decades
7499055 because most physicians serving communities are private business people and do not work for ih recruitment was the responsibility of site level physicians alone however given recruitment challenges in todays market ih has developed a comprehensive approach to support communities in attracting physicians
7499056 research shows that more than 50 per cent of physicians would use the web to begin searching for new practice opportunities the new website ensures that the health authority is able to maximize web based marketing strategies in its efforts to address current physician supply challenges for communities throughout ih
7499057 it will take about three hours to do the repairs and during that time about 300 people will be without power
7499058 a generation is catching a vision from sea to sea to influence every realm of society
7499059 we see how these movements have sunk their ideological claws into a generation and have produced a mass of social wreckage and a trail of shattered lives
7499060 the tide is turning and that canada is in the midst of the greatest comeback this nation has ever seen
7499061 why the great concern why stand on guard what are we defending canada against where is the threat coming from who or what is our enemy
7499062 a baby is not a person until it is outside the womb
7499063 that wasnt my field i soon found out and because i liked cars so much decided this wasnt a bad profession either there were a bunch of us in salmon arm that liked the automobile business and a local businessman in the city saw what i could do without training and made me an offer that i would come to work for him and he would train me in the business i quickly jumped on the chance to see where it would go and whether i would like this as professional and business i wasnt all that sure i wanted to make the move for my future in this direction but decided to stick it out and it was a good career decision my dad was a heavy duty mechanic so i had that for a background the natural aptitude was there
7499064 i graduated from salmon arm high school and went to work in the shop where my dad worked in the parts department shipping and receiving then i decided to go traveling for a year when i was doing that job in the parts department i was most interested in how the place ran as a business when i came back from my year of travel i decided i was going to take the business program at ouc at that point it didnt matter what business it was going to be i just knew i wanted to get involved in something i had a mentor in salmon arm that helped me to get an inside look at the business world before i was finished school the opportunity to take over the auto body shop where todd worked in kelowna became available we worked out the details of what it would take to buy the shop and six months later we started in september 2003
7499065 we took over rudys body shop and in march 2004 and we renamed the business prestige collision we just didnt have enough room at rudys as you know it was a small operation for things like parking so we started to look the following year we had a couple of deals fall through before we found this space on kirschner road we put our offer in and it was accepted in june 2007
7499066 on part of the project we hired a general contractor because of our lack of expertise in this area even in the family there was no construction experience the contractor built the body shop and we tackled the strip commercial centre
7499067 in our first shop we hired a couple of people that were older than us but they didnt fit into our way of thinking about the future stuck in their ways probably describes it best were stubborn and very precise about the way we want things done with the customer front and centre all the time because we started this new shop we wanted harmony from the get go and hiring the young technicians has been the best thing that we could have done and the work they produce is outstanding it is great to have people on staff that actually care if the customer comes back in the future were trying to create a culture that you will feel when you come into the building where people will see the work that is being done by a crew who will care about the finished product it makes for a good place to work everyone on staff is part of what we are trying to accomplish here the last eight months in the old building were super stressful we were so tight on space and it was difficult for everyone but they saw what our plans were for this new location and they wanted to be a part of the expansion and the future we are four times the size now that we were back then our specialty is collision repair thats what we fix we dont really restore cars or do complete paint jobs our specialty would be making your car look as good or better than before it was in an accident
7499068 since the moment i set foot on this site i was inspired to create a place where the full resort get away experience could be enjoyed by owners and vacationers and we are thrilled that bellstar has come on board to help us create and implement such a program
7499069 the fact that bellstar is also providing technical and planning expertise operations management and their reservations system adds greater value to the resort
7499070 but we are trying to understand the label on a juice bar
7499071 it is one of those ideas that makes you wonder why didnt someone think of this before
7499072 i had an episode with summit energy they contacted me the day after my husband died and talked to my son he told them they should talk to me because their offer sounded good they never did and i never signed anything nor did anyone else but they told terasen that i was their customer and it took endless calls and several months of higher bills and an ultimate complaint laid by me with the utilities commission before summit let me out from under what they called compassionate grounds this was without a signed contract my advice is dont even talk to these people
7499073 is devoting the status of inter palestinian division among the palestinians
7499074 focusing on the release of prisoners that belong to a certain palestinian and excluding other prisoners belong to other factions is a real discrimination
7499075 when hamas negotiates a prisoners swap with israel it seeks to release all prisoners without any discrimination
7499076 todays release of 198 prisoners from israeli jails is completely an israeli unilateral action and the palestinian side can not decide who the prisoners that should be released are
7499077 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7499078 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7499079 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7499080 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs
7499081 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7499082 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7499083 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7499084 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7499085 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7499086 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7499087 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7499088 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7499089 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7499090 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7499091 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7499092 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7499093 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
7499094 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7499095 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7499096 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7499097 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7499098 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7499099 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7499100 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7499101 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7499102 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7499103 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7499104 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7499105 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7499106 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7499107 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7499108 since some of them were dissolved earlier and the remaining others were working without a license
7499109 we were not being allowed to organise a peaceful sit in while in jammu hindu extremists were helped by the police and other government forces to enforce an economic blockade of kashmir valley and attacks on muslims
7499110 the islamic republic has become self sufficient in manufacturing all types of military vessels
7499111 iran is the main force safeguarding peace and security in the persian gulf and the sea of oman with its strong presence in the strategic region

7499113 iran continues its routine cooperation with the un nuclear watchdog within the framework of the modality action plan an agreement between the iaea and iran in a constructive atmosphere
7499114 the bjp government has no control over the vast forested area in bastar that is under the command of maoists the police are unable to enter the forests to locate the chopper officials believe it fell down
7499115 it is a complete failure of the bjp government and raises a question mark about its competence
7499116 taliban have secured assurance that the security forces will also stop actions
7499117 there are still some pending points that the agreement would not be approved but for appropriate changes that would preserve the complete sovereignty of iraq
7499118 there still are some talks with the american side about those pending points to change them in order to reach an agreement that would safeguard the interests of both sides
7499119 the proposed timelines are only suggestions which the iraqi side is trying to negotiate with the americans about
7499120 there is a major shortage of trained medical professionals and nurses in the country and this is a major challenge for us in providing healthcare services to the people of india
7499121 we need to address these issues both at the national and regional levels to ensure that there are no shortages of doctors and nurses it is heartening that assam is taking the lead in setting up medical colleges
7499122 assam is taking the lead in showing the rest of india in terms of providing adequate healthcare delivery especially in the rural sector
7499123 the results of the national rural health mission nrhm in assam were very encouraging and the state government needs to be complimented for it
7499124 the medical college will go a long way in further boosting the healthcare facilities in the state
7499125 the prime minister will lay the foundation stone of the bodoland university a planetarium and a science museum cum childrens park in kokrajhar
7499126 the reason for our presence in afghanistan is that it is very important to assist this nation in getting back on its feet after years of bloody war and it is necessary with a continued military presence in the country
7499127 we have been told that some of the medicines used post surgery were past the expiry date and have ordered an investigation by dr balasubramanian the dean of the government medical college in tiruchirappalli
7499128 those found guilty of negligence and instrumental in the poor losing their eyesight will certainly be punished
7499129 when the police and the crpf were trying to warn the protesters to disperse somebody from within the mob fired at them injuring two paramilitary troopers and two policemen
7499130 the crpf fired at the mob in retaliation in which 15 people were injured the injured were evacuated for treatment to a hospital in srinagar city
7499131 one of the crpf troopers later succumbed to injuries in a hospital
7499132 we have arrested malik and his supporters have peacefully dispersed after his arrest
7499133 what you call the routine drill of keeping these gentlemen under house arrest where they freely received guests and visitors who would be shown in by armed guards provided by the government has been broken now
7499134 cholera has been a constant problem in the city we have so far reported over 450 cases
7499135 the recent yamuna floods are a set back and we think the water contamination may increase and add to the cholera situation besides it will be favourable for mosquito breeding
7499136 they need to be careful about their water intake to prevent spread of cholera and other gastroenterological problems the stagnant water would also assist in spread of dengue
7499137 the numbers are really increasing i think we have nearly 65 cases of dengue so far good monsoon flood and the current humid atmosphere are providing fodder for the aedes aegypti mosquito the carrier of dengue
7499138 we have been telling people again and again that only awareness drive by mcd or any government drive wont achieve success unless we have support from the people
7499139 in the wireline segment the subscriber base has slightly decreased to 38 76 million in july 2008 as against 38 92 million subscribers in june 2008

7499170 this project would not have materialised without governments support and the decision to approve our request to lease a portion of this farm
7499171 vejo 198 her is estamos felizes por sua liberta o mas ainda temos tristeza em nossos cora es porque ainda h onze mil detidos em pris es israelenses

7499182 i will defend the goal in the first competitive game against nac the trainer told me
7499183 what will happen after that well i have no guarantees of course i must make sure that i perform well because who performs well plays
7499184 i know that you can change at the very last minute but he wasnt listed as one of the subs
7499185 its something i probably need to talk to the ffa about just to have a clarification about that ruling but certainly we know that you can make a change right up to just before the game starts
7499186 once again franky farina has done a shifty on us
7499187 no i would prefer a little bit more clarification even if you have a fifth substitute named so at least we know that hes actually testing and theres a possibility that he might start the game
7499188 in that situation i would prefer to know whos lining up where because even craig moore with one leg is probably just as good as a centre back or a pairing at the back
7499189 he adds a lot of experience and i would have preferred craig moore not be there
7499190 the truth is this very rarely happens ive never lived such an experience before neither as a player nor as a coach
7499191 it was very surprising i relied on the opinion that there are teams who sometimes find it harder to play with a man more
7499192 with less players the team unites more and sacrifices more also the concentration levels improve our opponent didnt know how to play with their advantage and we showed we knew how to take advantage of it very well
7499193 we had to change the match but i guess that a defeat like that has to hurt but he emery is a young coach with a lot of talent and i think theyve shown they are going to be useful team this year
7499194 if you cross the median chances are good that the resulting crash will cause a fatality or incapacitating injury because they usually occur at high speeds
7499195 the studies make it clear that cable barriers are keeping people from crossing the median and they are saving lives
7499196 we zijn niet 100 zeker maar het ziet er naar uit dat het gaat om een witte haai er is geen reden om aan te nemen dat het dier niet van de kust van de vs naar hier is gezwommen
7499197 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7499198 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7499199 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7499200 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees
7499201 it is emphasized government agencies and their employees cannot destroy records at will
7499202 with respect to the retention and disposal of records section 57 25 of the arts and cultural affairs law states in relevant part that
7499203 2 no local officer shall destroy sell or otherwise dispose of any public record without the consent of the commissioner of education the commissioner of education shall after consultation with other state agencies and with local government officers determine the minimum length of time that records need to be retained such commissioner is authorized to develop adopt by regulation issue and distribute to local governments retention and disposal schedules establishing minimum retention periods
7499204 further when an agency indicates that it does not maintain or cannot locate a record an applicant for the record may seek a certification to that effect
7499205 shall certify that it does not have possession of such record or that such record cannot be found after diligent search
7499206 that city of north tonawanda police department does not have possession of records photographs or that such record photographs cannot be found after diligent search
7499207 detective capt hall and detective kalota then arrived at the scene and took photos at scene for evidence
7499208 baltimore is a much different place than robeson n c
7499209 the center is like a point of entry for indians
7499210 people only know what they see on television and movies
7499211 this is how we can teach and educate those who dont know us
7499212 non stavano uscendo da una stazione ferroviaria n andavano sulla ciclabile si sono andati ad accampare in un posto abbandonato da dio e dagli uomini dopo aver chiesto consiglio su dove mettere la tenda a un branco di pastori immigrati la loro stata una grave imprudenza
7499213 la politica della cdl sulla sicurezza nelle ignobili parole di alemanno
7499214 really biden is the ultimate washington insider obama shouldve picked somebody who knows absolutely nothing about politics
7499215 thats some smart thinking biden should poll very well good with mainstream blacks who are articulate
7499216 were doing everything we can to get these turbines up and spinning in massachusetts
7499217 if nobody else steps up to the plate theres still a good chance of us getting them
7499218 if they do sell them its not a big loss
7499219 we kind of told the mtc that very early into september were going to order the other turbines
7499220 were trying to determine whether its feasible to put a turbine up and generate power
7499221 were trying to determine whether we have the winds for electric generation
7499222 we think this is important that they do wind power testing
7499223 they should be looking at alternatives theyre spending money on marketing but they should study energy efficiency so they wouldnt need another coal burning plant
7499224 everything we do is with an eye toward protecting the environment
7499225 the scope of work was challenging but our outstanding craftsmen made quick progress on all tasks
7499226 this is a true testament of todays airmen because they came from 16 different bases throughout the united states and quickly became one outstanding unit accomplishing something that for most will be a once in a career opportunity
7499227 if you close it off you can halt anything bad trying to pass through
7499228 we work shifts and at least a third of those who are off shift should be training
7499229 the checkpoints in al kut are even more so because we are close to the iranian border and there seems to be a lot of iranian influence in this area
7499230 most want to learn the techniques used by coalition forces to better the checkpoints

7499232 that has earned them a lot of respect from coalition forces and local citizens

7499269 the 10 turbines at the east point farm have a total generating capacity of 30 megawatts which is enough green energy to meet more that seven per cent of the provinces electricity needs and thats without a single kilogram of greenhouse gases he said
7499270 we need these alternative forms of energy to bring competitive prices and wind will be that competitive price he said
7499271 we have had a great spirit of co operation with the federal government in pioneering wind energy production over the last 10 15 years and already p e i is generating 18 per cent of its energy from renewable wind owned by the people of the island
7499272 now we want to take that one step further and increase this development so our citizens can enjoy the economic benefits
7499273 its not surprising given the politics of wind energy in the state of texas
7499274 theres too many politics and too much money at stake that would prevent anything from being a negative with wind energy in the state of texas
7499275 theres been a number of these and i think the judicial process doesnt want to touch it

7499295 file your conflict disclosures everything up front and legal dot your is and cross your ts
7499296 ok but how do we get this wind law through we cant vote if two thirds of the board has declared a conflict of interest
7499297 no problem boys appoint a committee now this committee must appear unbiased although we know its subtly stacked pro wind appoint nonconflicted local officials to serve on the committee and then throw in one pro wind and one anti wind person for good balance dont ask for volunteers on this committee the key is to appoint members to retain control of the process but yet give the deceptive appearance that all community voices are represented once the committee has come up with a weak wind law one that allows the wind developer almost unrestricted access to the town and keeps the wind leaseholders happy then the town board will vote to adopt the wind law
7499298 but how can we vote to pass our wind law if we have conflicts
7499299 dont worry you claim you had nothing to do with the committees recommendations you have cleverly distanced yourself from the process you are simply approving what the committee who represents the community told you to do you have no fingerprints on this law
7499300 let them sue we think this is a position we can defend by the time they get enough citizens to lawyer up and challenge us well have the turbines up at which point the suit is basically meaningless why would they waste any more money on preventing something that has already happened
7499301 since approving the project against the advice of planningsa the state government has granted every variation requested by the developer
7499302 this includes increasing turbine capacity from 1 75 mw to 2 mw for a total of 40 mw which necessitated noise mitigation measures by the developer to meet environment protection agency noise guidelines for wind farms
7499303 interstate and overseas buffer distances of 1 5 to 2km are being introduced and enforced
7499304 this government is permitting trustpower to build turbines as close as 700m from homes and trusting the developers noise mitigation measures local residents are petrified they are about to be subjected to many sleepless nights

7499312 we have seen an increase of around 20 per cent in input costs in various categories since last year or so if the inflationary trend continues we may have to hike prices of our products
7499313 we cannot predict the time period or the percentage of hike
7499314 mass and scale based one and therefore the rising input costs cannot be absorbed over a longer period of time
7499315 however increasing prices is the last option we have undertaken cost cutting measures like reducing wastage increasing efficiency in energy consumption and transportation and strengthening the supply chain line to absorb the pressure
7499316 there was almost no hike in prices of biscuits for seven years till inflation rose in 2007 since then we have had to increase prices by minimal level in some of our sub brands
7499317 biscuits comprise around 85 per cent of our annual sales and are continuously in the process of broadening our national shelf one of the special focus areas is on health options where we plan to bring out additional formats
7499318 while all of us are quite proud to see our contingent returning with three medals i do not think that we can feel complacent about out performance
7499319 jamaica provides training from the primary school level and particularly concentrates on athletics
7499320 the prices of raw inputs like maize chicken and vitamin c powder have surged significantly we have raised prices of products to pass on some of the burden to consumers
7499321 the prices of animal and poultry feed rule in the range of rs 10 14 per kg compared with that of rs 7 10 last year
7499322 we think we can prevent a problem that could have as much impact as the s amp l crisis
7499323 we have taken various measures to utilise plant waste effectively to achieve our goal of becoming a zero waste company it is our endeavour first by an indian steel firm to make the world class plant into a green plant
7499324 we intend to seek patent for these two technologies and give it to entrepreneurs who could use them for comemrcial purposes

7499327 the money didnt come through so now he can just carry on
7499328 hes a neat horse nice to have in the stable but initially i underrated him
7499329 ilone really rates him she should know because she rides him in all his work
7499330 since i started in goal ive always had a massive throw so ive done that and tried to improve my game around it
7499331 hes a fantastic goalkeeper hes got all the attributes really for the position hes tall over six foot a good shot stopper and good in a one on one situation coming out at an attacker
7499332 hes got quick hands as well and his distribution for me personally hands and feet is first class really good he can throw the ball over the halfway line
7499333 hes obviously watched keepers that he admires and he likes and modelled himself a little bit on them which is great for me because not enough players in new zealand do that enough for my liking
7499334 last year i just sort of went along to training to see what it would be like and it sort of came as a shock to be announced in the squad and starting in the first game
7499335 its definitely helped improve my game being up against the best players in the region and against goalkeepers whove played for new zealand and to see where ive got to get to to get into the new zealand picture
7499336 i play out of goal just when i get a chance to keep the ball skills up and now that goalkeeping is like 70 per cent with the feet youve got to be able to play the ball out to your defenders
7499337 im normally up front because then when i get one on one with the keeper i know what hes thinking and where hes expecting me to go
7499338 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7499339 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7499340 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices
7499341 they were having the feast when a stranger walked in and blew himself up it is a criminal act i cannot believe that a muslim man could do it

7499345 my question is would the environmental protection agency and this government and the people of guam rather see it like this strewn all over with aluminum cans that can be recycled or would you rather see a mayor not just me but the other mayors take those and put it in an area where its neatly separated

7499353 i did not build this theater instead of planning my wedding
7499354 i wanted a small project that i could do that was not wedding centric
7499355 we live in a rural area and we dont have multiplexes and the few movie theaters we have are small cramped poor sound and arent really worth going to
7499356 it could have been done in one day but we took our time
7499357 i believe that the only tools that we needed were a sharpie a measuring tape a rubber mallet and a miter saw
7499358 we focused on making as big a screen as we could with the materials available and the cost at a minimum
7499359 in fact im pretty sure that our screen is bigger than all the ones in our immediate area my wife and i did go to one recently to see wall e at a local theater and after the show we agreed that our screen is much bigger
7499360 we love the challenge of building something wonderful ridiculous and tons of fun
7499361 we are just a couple of family guys in our late 20s early 30s and we made something we are proud of that is fun for everyone
7499362 to carry out the screen parts assemble them stretch the screen hoist and tie it down is about 45 minutes
7499363 then to wheel out the electronics which live on an a v cart get the power run to the cart place and hook up the front speakers takes about 15 minutes
7499364 well she thinks im crazy but she didnt need the theater to prove that

7499371 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens
7499372 our organization is neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7499373 results of genetic testing from three samples of the products recalled by maple leaf foods show that two tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria
7499374 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7499375 i think that k d b might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy lehman brothers
7499376 but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial
7499377 my point is that state run institutions may take a catalyst role in pursuing these kinds of deals

7499385 i said to myself get in the fairway get on the green and give yourself a chance because putting is what i do best
7499386 i knew if i hit it good enough with the way i putt i knew id have a chance
7499387 that putt was a lot more difficult than the one i had in regulation
7499388 it broke a couple feet its a pretty amazing putt to make in a playoff
7499389 its fun to show i can play that i can still make putts under pressure

7499392 normally the little wekiva river is just a trickle so when you see it up to this point you get a little scared
7499393 it seems to be getting worse but its not going down so theres a smell of standing water and its making us nervous
7499394 weve seen a couple of fish we havent seen any snakes or gators but who knows whats floating around in the water
7499395 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
7499396 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male
7499397 if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7499398 is this evidence of some male conspiracy keeping women down
7499399 he lists five women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bloody day
7499400 thats what youre up against its that sort of assumption
7499401 he talks about middle class white men being a beleaguered species on television well excuse me but jonathan ross jeremy on newsnight
7499402 look at the today programme have i got news for you newsnight
7499403 they are very much judged to be the people imbued with a sort of gravitas that women are still struggling to achieve
7499404 the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that
7499405 i felt its been coming even when i was 123 on the money list i tweaked a couple of things which is mainly taking the bogeys out the last three weeks ive been taking the bogeys out of play
7499406 its unbelievable i wouldnt have told anyone that i could win one of the last few tournaments of the season
7499407 i struggle in the bunkers as it is and to get those two lies was really unfortunate it was a tough pin placement and i just knew there were some birdies still out there
7499408 it was really scary getting into the rough in canada
7499409 i learned to lay up on par 5s so i can get favorable yardages instead of going for the green in two that helped today
7499410 i just need to focus and not be result oriented
7499411 my game wasnt where i wanted it to be today
7499412 i started very well but after a bogey on no 9 i couldnt really get that back
7499413 die fachliche tiefe und die thematische vielfalt der gedruckten ct auf ein fernsehformat zu bertragen war nicht einfach die gro e akzeptanz der sendung zeigt aber dass dies gelungen ist

7499415 wir werden die banken warnen dass bestimmte vorgehensweisen nicht akzeptabel sind und wenn es rechtzeitig zu nderungen kommt sind wir zufrieden

7499417 i think everybody understands the need for unity at this point
7499418 i think its pretty historic to have a woman do as well as shes done and it honors her
7499419 made it pretty much clear she wants us to get behind barack
7499420 it infuriates me why would the democratic party not want to celebrate a woman that got a substantive number of votes for the democratic party to even consider not allowing hillary clintons name to be included in the roll is insulting to the women throughout this country
7499421 what people have to understand is the party is divided its the thing that makes the democratic party so strong that we embrace different points of view
7499422 it puts to bed that something else could have been barack obama is the democratic nominee

7499438 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7499439 it wasnt where my ball was but like about 5 or 6 feet left it was actually moving you could see the grass going up and down it was actually there and we were trying to find it but we couldnt
7499440 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at that moment you could see him popping out i was really focused on what i was doing
7499441 westchester was a good golf course this tops westchester every single player out there absolutely enjoyed this golf course
7499442 i was surprised to see it go in and he was even more surprised to see mine go in
7499443 its hard to see your friend not win especially if hes playing against you but somebody has to win
7499444 i really am happy with how i played and obviously disappointed i wasnt able to play a little bit better in the playoff
7499445 ive got to forget about that and think about the other 72 holes
7499446 it was a tough day it wasnt easy to get close to the hole so birdie was difficult to come by
7499447 it was drying out really really a lot and youve got to play almost conservative on some holes

7499471 many people will have been surprised today to hear the dup junior minister jeffery donaldson expressing regret that the six counties will miss out on 2012 olympic action because the executive has not yet moved on the maze long kesh stadium
7499472 the reality of course is that this has not happened because the dup is split wide open on the issue
7499473 minister roches comments are yet another example of a government without a plan to tackle the political reality that the lisbon treaty is finished
7499474 but rather than step up to the job at hand the irish government has repeatedly tried to connive and convince a re running the lisbon treaty minister roches comments are just the latest in a string of silly season kite flying exercises
7499475 minister roche states his comments are personal what nonsense he also states that the irish cannot simply sit on our hands and keep saying no the only people who have sat on their hands since june 12th is the irish government and those who supported them in their yes to lisbon campaign
7499476 immediately following the success of the no campaign sinn f in sought a meeting with the taoiseach and submitted to the irish government a detailed series of recommended changes to the treaty that reflected the concerns articulated by the people during the campaign
7499477 we have since published this document entitled a better deal for ireland and the eu which addresses issues such as the loss of a permanent commissioner declining democracy within the eu the strengthening of key vetoes the removal of all self amending clauses public services and workers rights and a number of aspects of common foreign and defence policies
7499478 sinn f in is the only political party to have produced such a document the others have chosen instead to spend the passing months finger pointing and indulging themselves in a blame game

7499481 big money investors have turned oil into a proxy for the u s dollar
7499482 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7499483 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7499484 despite the resumption of baku tbilisi ceyhan operations socar is shipping part of its share in acg via iran in order tospeed its delivery to the world market

7499501 most folks dont oppose toll roads which have been separate from our public highways
7499502 what krusees done in texas over the past few years is create a scheme that diverts our tax dollars intended for freeways into these double tax tollways
7499503 the public highway right of way has been shifted to tollways so theres this monopoly and people are sort of forced to pay this double tax

7499584 this is the fourth ship being hijacked in a month in the waters
7499585 we call upon the un and the international community to take immediate steps to stop the worsening security situation in these waters
7499586 the ship has 39 crew of which 29 are malaysians and 10 filipinos
7499587 once again we find ourselves inspired by the generosity of dartmouths alumni parents and friends and the commitment they make year after year to the next generation of students and faculty
7499588 their philanthropy ensures that we can fulfill our historic mission to provide a transformative learning environment fostered by close student faculty interactions and shared out of classroom experiences with the aim of preparing men and women to contribute to their professions their communities and the world
7499589 given the economy and debate within the dartmouth community over governance we were heartened by these results and not surprised that participation was down
7499590 behind the accomplishment of each fund raising target is a common driver exceptional volunteer leadership we are indebted to the thousands of dartmouth alumni and parents who lead by example and articulate for others the impact that their charitable gifts have on the college her students and the broader society

7499601 what most people dont seem to realize is that there is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a civilization as from the upbuilding of one
7499602 so how do dartmouth grads many starting at nonprofits leapfrog their peers when it comes to compensation as they gain more experience
7499603 the ability to think outside the box and adapt as easily as dartmouth students do is what puts them ahead
7499604 and about how you need one on one contact to convince people to make a commitment to solve a common problem
7499605 im so grateful to have had a year to travel work explore and
7499606 sometimes when im walking along the little paths that weave past mud houses and through the fields of banana trees i inhale uganda and try to exhale gratitude
7499607 they gain new perspectives mature and are better prepared to meet the challenges of their first year
7499608 it was great to reconnect with my community and spend some time reflecting on what i really wanted my college experience to be
7499609 it is incredibly humbling to be asked to perform as part of the prestigious summer olympic opening weekend ceremonies
7499610 it is a great honor for the city of cincinnati and indeed for the united states of america
7499611 articulating the leadership statement in a way that captures the essence of dartmouths unique character
7499612 the 2008 presidential race a change election or more of the same
7499613 honor and integrity what does it mean to serve the common good
7499614 at dartmouth and at auk we recognize that higher education knows no national boundaries
7499615 and we understand how important it is to prepare students to deal with the issues of a global society
7499616 we admire dartmouths commitment to the liberal arts and want to emulate that in our own country
7499617 and we look forward to a deepening partnership with our friends in new hampshire
7499618 higher education in the middle east and north africa is one of my central academic interests
7499619 so when the opportunity arose to participate in advising a new university in kuwait one that would have a special relationship to dartmouth i jumped at the chance
7499620 the dartmouth auk project has created opportunities for a significant number of students faculty and administrators to participate in this important international development
7499621 i got a fascinating look at the political behavior of kuwaiti young people
7499622 even students who werent old enough to vote found ways to engage
7499623 just as spheres of knowledge are no longer self contained nations are no longer fully independent of each other
7499624 you occupy a special place in the history of this new university and in years to come will be honored for the legacy you will surely create

7499630 because like me butterflies dont swim all that well so anywhere they can safely land and get water with out drowning is good consider taking a shallow bowl and filling it with marbles or pretty rocks and then fill it with just enough water to level the rocks but not to submerge them
7499631 red will be our brand campaign theme again this year we will select a few high profile games for a rock the red red out theme
7499632 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers
7499633 the number of officers leaving the iaf prematurely has reached the levels it was around six years ago we are not holding people back just for the sake of it
7499634 a large batch of amateurish people cannot compensate a group of trained people as it takes time to train a person to the level required operationally
7499635 they have to be trained over a period of time and there are not shortcuts we are short of about 400 pilots but with the measures we are taking we will make good the shortage in the next five years
7499636 the iaf has addressed the issue with emphasis on two aspects retain and attract
7499637 whilst we cannot match the salaries of the private sector we compensate by offering a challenging and fulfilling profession with an unequalled quality of life
7499638 we are seeking to improve promotion avenues by the implementation of the ajay vikram singh committee avsc recommendations
7499639 the cost of training a single fighter pilot is rs 8 crore that of a transport pilot is rs 3 crore and it involves a cost of rs 2 5 crore to train a helicopter pilot
7499640 the cost of training an officer is recovered after eight years of service in the proposed career progression versus age profile an officer would have a reasonable idea of where he stands after 15 years of service at this juncture the officers be permitted an outlet with a golden handshake
7499641 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project

7499650 our success in the retail channel is focused on the fact that we have a billion nokia users worldwide right now
7499651 we have more consumer insight than any other company in the world we studied more than 64 000 consumers in 20 markets and that goes from emerging markets to developed countries and as a result of that data were bringing products and services to market that appeal to a wide variety of consumers and our retailers see value in that
7499652 youve got the convergence of the internet mobility context awareness this is changing the way people communicate voice is only 12 percent of the total use of the device people are web browsing theyre e mailing theyre using gps and their music nokia is looking beyond the device portfolio which in itself is very broad but were looking beyond the device and saying how do we evolve the usage of your handset into these areas to connect people with their passions and their interests anywhere
7499653 the one thing that consumers reach for when they leave the house or go anywhere is their mobile device so lets not underestimate the consumer buying power and what their interests are
7499654 the ability to offer a wide variety of choices i think is going to be critical for retailers this season so that we can address the specific needs of their consumer base
7499655 power generated by wind turbines is a function of several variables of which wind speed is the main variable being a natural phenomenon that depends on temperature and pressure gradients average wind speeds may rise or fall over a period of time after installation of the turbine in comparison with the speeds measured at site before installing a wind turbine consequently the turbine may generate more or less power than estimated on the basis of the pre installation wind speed measurements our observation is that in the long run the power generated by the turbine more or less evens out having said that there are many customers who are extremely happy with their investment in suzlon wind turbines

7499681 rose jackson the former campaign manager for failed labor candidate george newhouse has retracted anti zionist statements she made in 2006 as she attempts to clinch a seat on a sydney local council with a large proportion of jewish voters
7499682 she opposed zionism because it calls for the creation of a jewish state and i think all governments should be secular no jewish islamic christian states anywhere in the world just good robust secular democracies by speaking out on behalf of the palestinians and lebanese people we can give voice to those that some governments would wish to silence
7499683 naive looking back i think i just bought the prevailing polemic on campus at the time that israel was some sort of quasi theocracy having explored the subject more deeply since then i understand this is nonsense i realise i just misunderstood obviously the state of israel is not a state for the jewish religion but a homeland for the jewish people its a really robust democracy there are plenty of non jewish people in israel who have full citizenship rights if theres discrimination its no worse than what would happen in australia or america or anywhere else i completely support israels right to exist as a jewish state
7499684 it would have been very easy for ms jackson to go along with the anti semitism of the far left when she was president of the nus instead she chose the politically unpopular and risky path of speaking out against the anti semitism of the far left and she deserves credit for that
7499685 the state of israel is not a state for the jewish religion but a homeland for the jewish people
7499686 there are plenty of non jewish people in israel who have full citizenship rights
7499687 if there is discrimination its no worse than what would happen in australia
7499688 i completely support israels right to exist as a jewish state

7499718 public school financing system with its substantial dependence on local property taxes and resultant wide disparities in school revenue violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment
7499719 the right to an education in our public schools is a fundamental interest which cannot be conditioned on wealth
7499720 invidiously discriminates against the poor because it makes the quality of a childs education a function of the wealth of his parents and neighbors
7499721 t here is nothing simple or certain about predicting the consequences of massive change in the financing and control of public education the complexity of these problems is demonstrated by the lack of consensus with respect to whether it may be said with any assurance that the poor the racial minorities or the children in overburdened core city school districts would be benefited by abrogation of traditional modes of financing education additionally several research projects have concluded that any financing alternative designed to achieve a greater equality of expenditures is likely to lead to higher taxation and lower educational expenditures in the major urban centers a result that would exacerbate rather than ameliorate existing conditions in those areas
7499722 overlooked the fact that 75 of poor children lived in high spending districts
7499723 actually led to lower school spending for most poor children
7499724 the deferral of tax cuts would reduce household incomes in the near term the advice from treasury said

7499730 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7499731 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7499732 there is no doubt that we seek peace and we are trying to seek our goals and there wont be peace without the release of all prisoners
7499733 communication is crucial for the success of the plant and your relationship with your husband you cannot let things fester or go unspoken scheduling time to unpack things is a way to help stay on track my husband and i spend part of mondays just talking about the service we discuss the things that worked well things that did not potential problems and ideas we also spend time addressing how we are feeling as a woman i have had a roller coaster of emotions and feelings the first couple of years of planting a church are hard work and the wave of emotions that come with planting a church can range from excitement to fear frustration anger disappointment self doubt guilt and possibly even resentment talking about them with your spouse takes their power away and helps you to work through legitimate issues that need to be addressed and to identify the untruths satan has whispered in your ears
7499734 hi my name is i and 90 of america would like more renewable energy its not a tough call since its pretty clear that the future of the world depends on it so please tell senator reid and speaker pelosi to include a 8 year extension for the solar investment tax credits in the energy bill thank you
7499735 putting the 2 kw citizenre system on this house symbolized a 20 year dream for me to help put solar power within reach of anyone
7499736 we really wanted to do the right thing to make our new house is as green as possible but we sure didnt have the cash to buy a system or even to carry loan payments this way citizenre takes care of everything they install it fix it all that and our savings increase every time the rates go up
7499737 the family should save about 30 on their electricity each month for 25 00 per month
7499738 since they averaged 28 per month for that same amount of electricity they are already saving a little each month
7499739 its so great that we can actually have solar on our first house
7499740 by renting we actually save money and thats money we can save for something else and we know were still doing the right thing for our babys future thats the very best part of the story
7499741 i have been involved with residential solar power for over 20 years and put my own system on in 1990 you cant make gasoline in your house but you can make electricity on your roof ive been doing it for 17 years
7499742 ive been frustrated by how many people come to me for advice on solar only to find it is out of their financial reach with citizenres rental program all that changes anyone who wants to make clean green power in their home can do it with the help of citizenre i hope we duplicate paul and halas story nationwide beginning in 2008
7499743 do they want to stay in the executive if they do lets meet and address these issues
7499744 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7499745 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7499746 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7499747 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in
7499748 these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue

7499751 but to get the bill through the senate and also avoid a threatened veto by president bush democratic leaders are expected to abandon attempts to impose nearly 16 billion in new taxes on the oil industry with the revenue to be used to support renewable energy sources and conservation it remained unclear friday whether more limited tax provisions aimed at ensuring extensions of tax credits and incentives for renewable fuels development will survive

7499772 the bowlers bowled really well upfront picked up wickets and 225 235 is a good score to chase down but we lost four wickets in 15 overs from there it was a pretty uphill task we came close but not good enough

7499776 il comune di villa literno vanta un credito di 10 milioni di euro verso il commissariato di governo a fronte di un debito di 4 milioni nei confronti del geo eco ora questi due soggetti prima separati sono uniti nel consorzio unico quindi se la matematica non unopinione possiamo vantare 6 milioni di credito verso questo soggetto
7499777 per oltre 2 anni ricorda fabozzi questo territorio ha caricato su di s i problemi di unintera regione e stiamo ancora aspettando di ricevere il ristoro che la legge ci ha assicurato non vorrei che qualcuno lavesse dimenticato
7499778 prima dello scioglimento dei consorzi era in atto una trattativa di compensazione dei rispettivi crediti ora che il soggetto unico mi auguro che la questione diventi pi semplice e che non sia necessario un contenzioso oltre al danno non vorremmo ricevere anche la beffa
7499779 i contrattempi sono generati dal passaggio di consegne in corso fra il ce2 e il consorzi unico che al momento non ha ancora titolo per pagare gli stipendi

7499785 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
7499786 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7499787 its a common sense response to the realities on the ground
7499788 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles
7499789 government policy can be aligned with consumer demand and the efforts of the industry
7499790 congress created a program for direct loans and were hopeful that they can fund those this year
7499791 remember the 18 4 billion that congress appropriated at the urgent request of the president of the united states in the fall of 03 for which i helped floor manage and took on the responsibility along with others to push hard because i believe there is a nexus between the reconstruction and the physical safety and possible success of our military in the region just 6 billion of that 18 4 billion has been spent
7499792 success as i define it is leaving iraq better than we found it
7499793 many americans have already concluded that we cannot salvage iraq we should bring all our forces home as soon as possible they include some of the most respected voices on military matters in this country like congressman jack murtha theyre mindful of the terrible consequences from withdrawing but even worse in their judgment would be to leave americans to fight and to die in iraq with no strategy for success i share their frustration but im not there yet i still believe we can preserve our fundamental security interests in iraq as we begin to redeploy our forces

7499795 some democrats have been pleading with obama to use mccains tough response to the russian invasion of georgia to paint him as a trigger happy interventionist who would risk bringing a war weary nation into military conflict in regions where the united states has no interest

7499821 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

7499836 someone didnt do their due diligence exercise on the property
7499837 before you buy or sell a property of any kind either the buyer or the seller should do as a matter of course a proper due diligence to ensure there are no worms in the can it is surely the implication that no proper due diligence was done or that it was half baked
7499838 if they did it erroneously then certainly a potential purchaser may have a claim unless the purchaser should have reasonably known that such a contract was not possible in the first place

7499886 la informaci n que tenemos es que la ni a se acerc a los agentes de la polic a iraqu diciendo que llevaba puesto un chaleco explosivo y que no quer a explotar con l
7499887 si fue obligada a ponerse el chaleco o si lo hizo voluntariamente es lo que estamos investigando

7499889 as much as i hate to admit it i wasnt fully mentally focused
7499890 i like to use the football field and practice and being around the guys as a place to get away but i still had something lingering
7499891 but weve handled it everyone has learned from their mistakes and were ready to move on
7499892 it just wasnt the law stuff my grandmother linda caucci died in the middle of the season before the michigan game i was very close to her
7499893 he didnt play as well as he could have i think he knows that
7499894 but now he seems to be his old self and thats important for us to be good we have to have a good centerfielder

7499898 scirrotto shouldnt be on the team let alone a captain
7499899 he did what i think all of us would do and his teammates rallied around him i have no problem with that

7499919 es m s f cil para todos y en ese sentido no vamos a tener excusa eso no significa que sea f cil pero tenemos una ventaja importante respecto al a o pasado
7499920 el a o pasado est bamos temblando con cualquier golpe o contratiempo en algunos puestos y este a o estoy m s tranquilo
7499921 cuando la competencia es dura y los resultados no funcionan la tensi n es mayor pero tenemos que aprender de lo bueno y de lo malo de a os anteriores y sacar m ximo rendimiento de todos
7499922 por muchas especulaciones que hagamos vamos a ver d nde estamos el domingo

7499942 you know senator clinton during that same debate somebody asked her about the bankruptcy bill she voted for a bankruptcy bill in 2001 that the credit cards and the banks had been pushing that made it more difficult for folks who have been trapped in these unscrupulous loans where you get zero interest and then suddenly it pops up to 30 percent and the credit card companies even though they are sending these things in the mail constantly every day they dont want you to get out from under that debt so tim russert or somebody asked senator clinton why did you vote for that bill and she said well i voted for it but i hoped it didnt pass what does that mean

7499953 at the establishment of our constitutions the judiciary bodies were supposed to be the most helpless and harmless members of the government experience however soon showed in what way they were to become the most dangerous that the insufficiency of the means provided for their removal gave them a freehold and irresponsibility in office that their decisions seeming to concern individual suitors only pass silent and unheeded by the public at large that these decisions nevertheless become law by precedent sapping by little and little the foundations of the constitution and working its change by construction before any one has perceived that that invisible and helpless worm has been busily employed in consuming its substance in truth man is not made to be trusted for life if secured against all liability to account
7499954 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
7499955 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
7499956 but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us
7499957 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god not by works so that no one can boast
7499958 here i am i stand at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in and eat with him and he with me

7499972 the car sales situation might get better towards the end of the year but more likely it will pick up in 2009 simply because car sales are a discretionary big ticket item even more than housing new housing starts and these tend to get cut by consumers at a time when the economy is going into a downturn
