3100007 washington and tehran were both showing an increased desire to end the showdown that has raised fears of a military conflict
3100008 i didnt have any personal reason to choose that topic
3100009 i was looking for something that nobody had yet written about i guess it was what you call

3100016 its important for the students to start connecting to their peers
3100017 letting go a parents guide to understanding the college years
3100018 but if you plan to have a special family gathering have it ahead of time
3100019 they want this for their child but this is the price they pay for the childs success some struggle with not wanting to lose that intimate connection
3100020 grieving the loss of that phase of his life and my life
3100021 just being a worrier is a part of it not being able to know what hes up to all the time
3100022 but thats the way it should be he should be on his own but its just not being able to be his protector which im not anyway but i have the illusion i still am
3100023 i think the most important thing is for parents to realize that their emotions and their mixed feelings are normal and not to lose sight of what an incredible opportunity and privilege it is to send a child to college
3100024 the other thing i think is for parents to realize this relationship and their role doesnt end it just changes there is incredible joy in being able to talk to your child whos discovering new worlds and learn from your child
3100025 i think that if you stop and think about it if students are going way to residential college they are leaving behind all kinds of services support and people whove been involved in their lives
3100026 with the proper preparation they can make arrangements to have many of those supports
3100027 part of the transition is how we help them be involved in what skidmore college is
3100028 but what they need to do is work out with their child how theyre going to maintain this relationship theyre used to total involvement and total control over some of the decision making now they have to renegotiate all that we as the college can help with some of that but a lot of it is the work they have to do to renegotiate this relationship
3100029 its tempting for parents to give lectures but what makes more sense is to engage in a dialogue what are you looking forward to what are you anxious about almost all parents as well as the students have ambivalence about these things even the student who says i cant wait to get out of this house out of this town will i make friends will i fit in theyre very excited about the new freedom but in my experience talking to high school seniors theyre nervous about how to handle that freedom having parents engage in this kind of discussions with daughters and sons can be helpful
3100030 a new five cays beach to the people of the turks and caicos
3100031 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3100032 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3100033 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3100034 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3100035 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3100036 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
3100037 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

3100064 the systems themselves in my opinion can handle any creative challenge
3100065 the way we developed the performance capture workflow on avatar
3100066 that is going though facial algorithms and going back into the camera as a real time cg face of the character
3100067 you see it talk you see the eyes move it is pretty phenomenal
3100068 once weve laid down a take the take exists in the digital asset management system
3100069 its this amazing ability to quickly conjure scenes and images and great fantasyscapes that is very visual we call it director centric because i can use the camera to block the actors
3100070 when you are doing performance capture creatively its very daunting its very hard to imagine what it will look like but if you can see it if you can have a virtual image of what is it going to be like then you are there as the processing power goes up our models get more sophisticated and our lighting tools get more sophisticated even while we are making this movie im still doing a lot of virtual camera work on the film on stuff that was shot six months ago
3100071 we changed the words and he redid the dialogue we didnt have to recapture his body performance and he didnt have to put the performance capture suit on again we were just creating new words and we were creating a new face
3100072 one movie where the aesthetics of physical production and the aesthetics of virtual production are to the extent that we could do it pretty much it identical
3100073 were taking our virtual production toolset and superimposing it on physical production
3100074 we turned the set on the soundstage into a capture volume and turned the physical camera into a capture virtual camera so we were able to integrate cg characters and environments into our live action
3100075 we have people in flying vehicles and i can see what is outside the window fed in in real time
3100076 are we looking at a situation maybe 10 15 years out where most laptops are sold with 3 d stereoscopic screens most montors are stereo compatible most dvd players can run stereo content i can see this becoming much more pervasive that we are thinking now
3100077 step up to the plate to raise private funds to support the athletic enhancements not funded by the state
3100078 future began working with superintendent joe mattos in july 2007 it was actually his third day on the job to plan this project

3100080 a number of dedicated volunteers including the future board and the 24 member athletic enhancement advisory committee have worked tirelessly on this plan
3100081 the students of this district have always been futures first priority and we know theres already a great deal of excitement and enthusiasm for this next project
3100082 theres still a great deal of planning work to do
3100083 campaigns of this scope are like an endurance race and we have a lot of miles and hill work ahead of us but with nearly 400 donors to the first campaign we have a solid track record of support

3100271 paul tonko has been a great advocate for law enforcement for over the past two decades while serving in the new york state assembly his experience speaks for itself we would be honored to have paul representing the 21st congressional district
3100272 there is one important quality that separates paul tonko from many of those who seek public office paul is not in it for the fame or the glory or the power he is not running because he wants to be important paul tonko wants to help resolve the issues that face the people who live in the 21st congressional district he has the personality the energy and the experience to be successful as our next congressman and his success will be our success we are asking our members to support paul tonko as he has supported all of us throughout his many years of service in the nys assembly he is someone we can continue to count on to stand up for working people
3100273 as the region president ive seen firsthand that paul has always been there for us on local issues paul has not only been a supporter at the state level but has fought for out members locally he has helped fight against privatization for workers right to organize and for fair contracts but above all things paul tonko listens he listens to workers to families fighting to get by every day to retirees who struggle between choosing medication they need and food they must have we would be well served if paul tonko is our next congressman

3100450 we think it is a matter for investment into coal mines into transportation investment into the more efficient coal plants so the investment cost is very very high

3100459 the journey of illness is often defined by the many losses one goes through and the grief of seeing their dreams disappear many people however eventually find a fresh passion that they could not have imagined they would have ever taken the time to discover before they were diagnosed with an illness
3100460 i had always planned to work for a nonprofit doing something to help others but i never felt i was efficient or empathetic enough because i had not walked in the shoes of those i served now through my illness ministry and books on aspects of coping with illness i have the chance to use what i experience each day to reach out to others its my hope that they will also find hope despite their illness as they discover that new sense of purpose in the pain

3100545 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
3100546 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
3100547 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
3100548 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders

3100570 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3100571 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3100572 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3100573 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3100574 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3100607 if you can get your neighborhood groups to band together and share a common goal and look out for one another in a cooperative fashion its more effective than the fire department knocking on the door

3100633 it is the trademark owners burden to police its mark
3100634 we believe that legal errors were made in this decision and we have every reason to believe that the circuit court will look at them afresh and hopefully agree with us
3100635 if one were a flea market operator and you become aware that counterfeiting is going on with the individual sellers at the flea market you have a duty to investigate it
3100636 the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3100637 once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3100638 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting the best way to stop counterfeiting is ongoing collaboration between companies government agencies and law enforcement
3100639 the advocates believe the oil seeps up through bedrock cracks to deposit in sedimentary rock traditional petro geologists they say have confused the rock as the originator rather than the depository of the hydrocarbons
3100640 the study also confirmed a major argument of cornell university physicist thomas gold who argued in his book the deep hot biosphere the myth of fossil fuels that micro organisms found in oil might have come from the mantle of the earth where absent photosynthesis the micro organisms feed on hydrocarbons arising from the earths mantle in the dark depths of the ocean floors
3100641 cassini radar observations now permit an initial assessment of the inventory of two classes presumed to be organic of titan surface materials polar lake liquids and equatorial dune sands several hundred lakes or seas have been observed of which dozens are each estimated to contain more hydrocarbon liquid than the entire known oil and gas reserves on earth dark dunes cover some 20 of titans surface and comprise a volume of material several hundred times larger than earths coal reserves
3100642 we have determined that titans methane is not of biological origin so it must be replenished by geological processes on titan perhaps venting from a supply in the interior that could have been trapped there as the moon formed

3100645 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3100646 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3100647 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3100648 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3100649 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3100650 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3100651 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3100652 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3100653 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3100654 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3100655 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3100656 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3100657 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3100658 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3100659 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3100660 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3100661 isaac didnt read music but you couldnt believe a guy could sit at a piano and come up with the sounds he did
3100662 when people talk about the memphis sound that was isaac
3100663 they said shaft was a relentless character and it had to denote some kind of action or drama
3100664 were interested in when the cows will turn the water on and off for themselves
3100665 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3100666 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3100667 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3100668 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3100669 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3100670 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3100671 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3100672 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3100673 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3100674 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3100675 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3100676 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3100677 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3100678 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3100679 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3100680 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3100681 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3100682 who are open to doing something on the production side
3100683 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3100684 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3100685 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3100686 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3100687 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3100688 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3100689 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3100690 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3100691 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3100692 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3100693 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3100694 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3100695 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3100696 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3100697 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3100698 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3100699 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3100700 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3100701 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3100702 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3100703 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3100704 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3100705 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3100706 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3100707 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3100708 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3100709 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3100710 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3100711 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3100712 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3100713 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3100714 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3100715 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3100716 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3100717 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3100718 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3100719 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3100720 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3100721 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3100722 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3100723 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3100724 this is a voting block that has never been open before and it has opened up at such a time as this
3100725 the majority of people to get their rights restored are democrats and if we get them registered we might overtake the state
3100726 could certainly swing an election but there are millions and millions of voters
3100727 theres also the perception for some reason that they are all black and all democrats and thats certainly not the case
3100728 it kind of offended my notion of justice you can serve your time and still have your rights taken away
3100729 i studied the history of black disenfranchisement in the state we had the grandfather laws and the tissue paper ballots when a black man came to vote they gave him a tissue paper ballot that was later thrown out there were lynchings and riots
3100730 weve got a long history of depriving people of the right to vote in florida
3100731 the information is not filtering to the people who need it
3100732 its catch as catch can as people learn about it
3100733 if this country lawyer could figure this out you mean the government couldnt do it
3100734 not knowing what to do makes people not want to go do it
3100735 you dont realize how far behind you are until you get back in the mainstream maybe fear maybe procrastination just kind of paralyzed me and i just didnt go forward with it
3100736 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3100737 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3100738 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3100739 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3100740 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3100741 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3100742 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3100743 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3100744 the us stock is going tobacco one inc produce millons of tobbaco kinds and you can roll your own tobbaco under your brand name within the united states tbco pk can make you rich
3100745 dowjones going up this will make the sales go aboe 240 millon and the company to bring the sharehold values to over 1000 all you need is to invest in tbco
3100746 because of those factors we have less revenue coming in but we still have fixed costs to operate the gas system that we have to pay for

3100785 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue
3100786 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise
3100787 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting

3100789 we kind of cooked it up a long time ago
3100790 i dont know of any other management companies that do things this way
3100791 we work closely with a select roster of artists we love respect and call our friends our goal is to create a friendly and productive environment for these people to make music while keeping their integrity and artistic vision intact
3100792 we all have separate finances and run our things independent of each other but we also help each other as much as possible
3100793 i manage a bands audience too so that makes more of a connection
3100794 if you go to some big artists website theres no contact info for anybody that works for her i hope it never gets to a level where thats the case with any of my bands
3100795 every band has different needs its like being a head football coach i coordinate activities between the booking agent the label etc we decide that were going to tour x number of days make a plan for that make a marketing plan a tour plan im the middle man im in the middle of everything that way the band can make one phone call and figure out whats going on
3100796 on the last uncle tupelo tour it was their first tour with a bus
3100797 tour bus drivers are one step up from truckers and they usually want backstage passes after the first week the driver gave the pass back to me he said they were the lamest band hed been around
3100798 tony margherita was managing uncle tupelo and i inherited the bottle rockets by accident
3100799 i started managing them by default i wasnt officially their manager and i wasnt qualified

3100803 we get a lot of emails that start i know you dont take submissions but
3100804 they think theyre the exception the thing these bands dont know is when we get an over the top pitch email from some band it gets sent out to all our friends because its funny
3100805 i can only do a good job of managing three or four or five bands if theyre busy its hard to even think about taking on new bands

3100849 temos que tentar vencer para termos seguran a no jogo de volta que ser no morumbi
3100850 tenho certeza de que vai ser um jogo dif cil pois temos uma equipe complicada j na primeira fase da competi o mas a partida dentro da nossa casa e precisamos fazer da arena uma das nossas for as para o jogo
3100851 o financiamento dos carros caiu de uma m dia de 85 para 70

3100856 tudo vai depender do desempenho no final do ano quando o setor geralmente se aquece
3100857 o m xico pelo contr rio se transformou em plataforma para a produ o de carros grandes at devido sua proximidade com o mercado americano eles ganham pelo valor agregado e n s pelo volume
3100858 good neighborliness is irans logical policy and i announce tehrans readiness to help resolve the differences between azerbaijan and armenia
3100859 we received very reliable information that the russians decided to move towards gori thats why we decided to pull out all our troops and to relocate them to defend tbilisi
3100860 we are right now driving through the town and i see no trace of troops or military vehicles it is absolutely deserted
3100861 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3100862 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3100863 russia of course will take its peacekeeping mission to a logical conclusion we will strive for working relations with all participants of this conflict
3100864 russian peacekeepers and support units are carrying out an operation aimed at preventing georgian forces from regrouping to carry new attacks on south ossetia senaki is one of the places where such actions were underway
3100865 this provocation was aimed at occupying south ossetia abkhazia and then all of georgia
3100866 turkey does not have much to do it is already doing what it can
3100867 this war is about a big sharing deal that began with the independence of kosovo kosovo abkhazia south ossetia they are all pieces that will slowly fall into place
3100868 this is a game to decide the place of georgia in between the west and russia russia hinted that there may be problems as georgia approached the west
3100869 war is a result of the contest for global hegemony
3100870 turkey is in a difficult position but it can do nothing more than to try to bring the two sides to the negotiating table
3100871 turkey will also stick to georgian territorial integrity but only by declaring its opinion in principle
3100872 it is impossible to understand turkeys military support for georgia we have a connection with turkey from the past
3100873 if all ethnic minorities start implementing their own foreign policy vision turkey cannot move nearly all groups want to protect their own ethnic relatives turkey has this experience and will not take an adventurous step
3100874 turkey is a nato member and it sends military aid to many places stability in georgia and keeping russians away from its borders as much as possible is in turkeys interests
3100875 i saw the prophet give the aadhaan for prayer in the ear of al husayn ibn alee when his mother faatimah gave birth to him
3100876 whoever says as his last words la ilaaha ill allah will enter paradise
3100877 musa said o my lord teach me something by which i can remember you and supplicate to you allah answered say o musa la ilaaha illallah none has the right to be worshipped but allah musa said o my lord all your slaves say this allah said o musa if the seven heavens and all of their inhabitants besides me and the seven earths were in a pan of a scale and la ilaaha illallah was in another pan la ilaaha illallah would outweigh them
3100878 i heard allahs messenger saying allah the most high said
3100879 the best of my sayings and of the sayings of all prophets before me is there is no god but allah alone without partner to him belong all sovereignty and glory and he has power over all things
3100880 belief is seventy and some branches its lowest branch is the removal of harm from the road while its highest is to say there is no deity worthy of worship but allah
3100881 subhaan allaah wal hamdu lillaah wa laa ilaaha illallaahu wallaahu akbar
3100882 that our president has given a positive reply to the invitation is definitely an important step but more important than that is establishing a dialogue between the two peoples the turks and the armenians we are not politicians but we will be in yerevan on september 6 in the name of peace and friendship fifty of us will be there to form a bridge but hundreds of us will follow in the near future
3100883 some ears might not perceive karlens and eriks voice as a strong one but to us their voice is one free from hatred and enmity we were deeply impressed when we read the interview in which these two strong and self confident young people from armenia expressed themselves and the way they look with hope to the future without denying the past
3100884 as karlen and erik pointed out no matter what words you utter to describe those events in history they would not alleviate the pain caused by them
3100885 traumas can only be overcome through mutual understanding having close contacts sharing the pains and listening to each other
3100886 for historians too voice an official rhetoric just as politicians do
3100887 we have begun for some time debating about our thoughts freely in turkey the biggest problem between the turks and the armenians is just a lack of a healthy and full fledged communication we members of the two societies might begin a dialogue by detaching ourselves from politics we truly do not need official ideologies anymore
3100888 if anyone desires a religion other than islaam submission to allaah never will it be accepted of him and in the hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost their selves in the hell fire
3100889 to thee we sent the scripture in truth confirming the scripture that came before it and guarding it in safety
3100890 ash hadu anla ilaaha ill allaah wa ash hadu anna muhammadan rasool allaah
3100891 i bear witness that there is no deity none truly to be worshipped but allaah and i bear witness that muhammad is the messenger of allaah
3100892 and i have chosen you so listen to that which is inspired to you verily i am allah there is none worthy of worship but i so worship me and offer prayer perfectly for my remembrance
3100893 the first matter that the slave will be brought to account for on the day of judgment is the prayer if it is sound then the rest of his deeds will be sound and if it is bad then the rest of his deeds will be bad
3100894 allah has obligated five prayers whoever excellently performs their ablutions prays them in their proper times completes their bows prostrations and khushu khushu in the prayer is where the persons heart is attuned to the prayer this feeling in the heart is then reflected on the body the person remains still and calm his gaze is also lowered even his voice is affected by this feeling in the heart has a promise from allah that he will forgive him and whoever does not do that has no promise from allah he may either forgive him or punish him
3100895 if a person had a stream outside his door and he bathed in it five times a day do you think he would have any filth left on him
3100896 that is like the five daily prayers allah wipes away the sins by them
3100897 the five daily prayers and the friday prayer until the friday prayer are expiation for what is between them
3100898 if your brother sins against you go and tell him his fault between you and him alone if he listens to you you have won over your brother if he does not listen take one or two others along with you so that every fact may be established on the testimony of two or three witnesses if he refuses to listen to them tell the church if he refuses to listen even to the church then treat him as you would a gentile or a tax collector amen i say to you whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again amen i say to you if two of you agree on earth about anything for which they are to pray candal
3100899 if your brother sister sins against you go and tell him her his her fault between you and him her alone
3100900 i think that this passage is about the community of faith and how it holds individual christians accountable i also think it is about how the power of god works through the community of faith the first part is about discipline and order but i dont think jesus was talking about the role of the church community to discipline people so much as he was talking about how the power of god works in a community where individuals submit themselves to one another in an orderly community i see how that works in the amish community but i think most people just see the amish community as a boundary of rules and restrictions but i dont think the amish see it that way i think they see the boundaries as the gathering of individuals who submit themselves to agreement so that they can experience christ in their midst
3100901 it doesnt start with discipline it starts with love we know god loves us and we are to love each other there is nothing better we can experience on this earth than the love of our brother or sister it is that love that allows us to address the sins in our midst in the way that jesus said we practice exactly what it says in the bible were not perfect people we sin against each other and we deal with it so it doesnt go so far as to bring division in the community we greatly value the christian community because we know how very powerful it is to experience jesus in our midst
3100902 i think our people have moved very far in the direction of practicing their faith and prayer life as individuals we rarely hold each other accountable for our sins and it is often very difficult for even two people to agree on anything instead we isolate ourselves from each other and call on god to be with us as we go it alone against the world even as members of a faith community we do not think of ourselves as one body with many parts but instead as many individual bodies who share a part of who we are with the transitory church community
3100903 if your brother sins against you go and tell him his fault between you and him alone
3100904 go and tell him his fault between you and him alone
3100905 tell him his fault between you and him alone if he listens to you you have gained your brother
3100906 how terrible are thy deeds so great is thy power that thy enemies cringe before thee 4 all the earth worships thee they sing praises to thee sing praises to thy name
3100907 you hold the key to love and fear in your trembling hand just one key unlocks them both its there at your command
3100908 where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them
3100909 will arise and have mercy on for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them

3100916 hey i wanna put all my investments in and buy all my oil from this guy
3100917 nobody should seek his own good but the good of others
3100918 everyone should be quick to listen and slow to speak
3100919 turning you ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding
3100920 whatever you do do it all for the glory of god do not cause anyone to stumble for i am not seeking my own good but the good of many so that they may be saved
3100921 make every effort to be found spotless blameless and at peace with him
3100922 thank you god for not leaving me like you found me but that you called me to change to be like you
3100923 faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action is dead
3100924 but what about you who do you say i am
3100925 i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last the beginning and the end
3100926 where in the bible does it say that jesus is not god
3100927 but what about you who do you say i am
3100928 for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as i am known
3100929 now we see even the things that surround us but by means of a glass or mirror which reflects only their imperfect forms in a dim faint obscure manner so that our thoughts about them are puzzling and intricate and everything is a kind of riddle to us but then we shall see not a faint reflection but the objects themselves face to face distinctly now i know in part even when god himself reveals things to me great part of them is still kept under the veil but then i shall know even as also i am known in a clear full comprehensive manner in some measure like god who penetrates the centre of every object and sees at one glance through my soul and all things
3100930 greater love has no one than this that a man lay down his life for his friends
3100931 i urge you brothers in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship
3100932 i pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being so that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and i pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power together with all the saints to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of christ and to know this love that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of god now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine according to his power that is at work within us to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus throughout all generations for ever and ever amen
3100933 faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action is dead
3100934 do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves do what it says
3100935 lord you know all things you know that i love you
3100936 my sheep listen to my voice i know them and they follow me
3100937 if you love me you will obey what i command
3100938 but the seed that fell on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart who hear the word retain it and by persevering produce a crop
3100939 here i am i stand at the door and knock
3100940 if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in and eat with him and he with me
3100941 you know i lived a long time and i always want to make sure that im where i want to be when the lord returns
3100942 brian are you where you wanna be when jesus returns when youre walking out your faith and i send my son are you going to be found doing the work i called you to do
3100943 you also must be ready because the son of man will come at an hour when you do not expect him
3100944 my father is always at work to this very day and i too am working
3100945 but in keeping with his promise we are to be looking foward to a new heaven and a new earth the home of righteousness so then dear friends sorry to get off topic but i love how he calls us dear friends do you have anyone in your life that calls you dear friend since you are looking foward to this make every effort to be found spotless blameless and at peace with him

3101059 weve got to make sure our team is sound from top to bottom
3101060 i needed to handle large databases and have tools to make proper decisions on which patients were to be selected for specialized and very expensive care
3101061 certainly this accomplishment would be possible without technology but that would take a lot of work from several people working continuously that costs a lot and it is very difficult to keep performance 24 hours a day on the highest level there will be mistakes misunderstandings etc resulting in repeated failures
3101062 i understood how extremely fast they could make searches and how they could combine all data in an illustrated way
3101063 the whole web 2 0 explosion has moved from the consumer and college student world to professionals in the business world
3101064 employees are seeing this as a way of enlarging their sphere and interacting with colleagues
3101065 people dont just chat they connect with people and end up talking about things that have an impact on the business

3101071 use caution with any web sites that appear of a georgia official source but are without any recent news i e sat sun aug 9 10 as these may be fraudulent
3101072 we are now seeing new attacks against ge sites ge is the top level domain for georgia ed www parliament ge and president gov ge are currently being hit with http floods
3101073 are well known to be under the control of rbn and influenced by the russian government
3101074 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
3101075 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3101076 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3101077 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3101078 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3101079 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3101080 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
3101081 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
3101082 this is a planning took where all things are going
3101083 one electric motor rather than two it also has a pair of dry clutches instead of the planetary gearset that permanently links the lexuss two motor generators to its petrol engine the advantage is that the electric engine can drive without a physical connection to the petrol engine reducing driveline drag

3101085 well i was so stupid as to believe what they said
3101086 whether we are spirited adults or spirited children we need words that focus on our strengths and potential instead of on our weaknesses a positive approach changes not only our vocabulary but our perceptions and as a result our actions as well
3101087 today let my words be sweet for tomorrow i may have to eat them
3101088 soldiers walk the streets carrying thousands of dollars to pay iraqis for doorways battered in american raids and limbs lost during firefights
3101089 mr darwish had the straight hair wire rim glasses and blue blazer of a european intellectual
3101090 and while he wrote in classical arabic rather than in the language of the street
3101091 during the war that led to israels independence mr darwish and his family from the palestinian village of al barweh left for lebanon the village was razed but the family sneaked back across the border into israel where mr darwish spent his youth
3101092 politically active fairly early he was arrested several times and was a member of the israeli communist party
3101093 but he quit in the early 1990s over differences with the leadership
3101094 you read this obituary of mahmud darwish in the guardian and realize how better european media are in comparison to u
3101095 his first poetry symbolised the palestinian resistance to israeli rule his first volumes leaves of the olive tree 1964 a lover from palestine 1966 and end of the night 1967 were published in israel during this time darwish was a member of the israeli communist party rakah and edited the arabic edition of the partys newspaper al ittihad israeli palestinians were restricted in any expression of nationalist feeling darwish went to prison several times and was frequently under house arrest
3101096 we were wasting time teaching people to eat healthfully if they couldnt find affordable food stores and they are not getting the full value of the food assistance vouchers that taxpayers were supporting
3101097 how do we begin to make this dream of a healthy and sustainable lifestyle available to everyone
3101098 the low hanging fruit may be gone but theres still a lot out there
3101099 back in the day who would have thought that a random group of letters dot com would be worth something
3101100 well to that company that has the corresponding name its worth a lot
3101101 dot com is always going to be the blue chip standard
3101102 all of this new property is going to be wasteland because its not going to be recognizable to the public
3101103 its the crowd isnt it really i love coming to liverpool and i love playing to that crowd theyre such a brilliant bunch of people
3101104 definitely manchester is where things kinda started out for me but ive had a very close relationship with liverpool over the years as well it being home to my football team and also all of my family is from liverpool and back to the cream days at nation its always had a place in my heart i have so many great friends up there
3101105 yeah ill definitely poke my head in there for sure
3101106 yeah ive got some various bits and bobs actually ive got quite a bit of hacienda memorabilia ive got a light and ive got a little piece of the dance floor as well tony wilson actually gave that to me personally i had missed the auction because i was in new york djing at twilight but they saved some bits for me i was very touched because its such an important place to me
3101107 chic will be amazing the place will go off to chic i cant wait to see that i hope theyre not on at the same time as me
3101108 just a lot of happy faces the last one i was at a couple of years ago i went into the vip area backstage and saw a couple of mates of mine dancing in towels and not much else it was a frightening thing actually
3101109 wellies wet wipes ear plugs all the usual festival items and sleep as far away from the porta cabins as possible
3101110 likely never would have happened if the state had done its job and locked up ezekiel roberts
3101111 yes we believe had he been arrested this never would have occurred
3101112 how dare anyone fire a weapon into a crowded area where people are having a celebration with children
3101113 its not fair to our police department who are arresting these individuals and they go through the court and end up getting through the system then three days later the person lays dead
3101114 if the court had done their job that person would have been locked up and incarcerated right now

3101122 everything he could to make sure reade landed at a good school
3101123 knows of no support that brodhead gave him at brown
3101124 whether that happened behind his back he cant be sure it may have happened but he doesnt know about it
3101125 aware of one letter i was told mr brodhead wrote on my behalf
3101126 nobody ever communicated to him anything specific about any letter
3101127 there was some general knowledge that brodhead was writing a letter to assertively help him but that knowledge was very general and very vague
3101128 there is no use in trying to pressure pakistan through verbal attacks or by cutting relations
3101129 the cabinet should have considered the political and economic consequences of their decision i am sure that most of the ministers still have no idea of what they were doing they just raised their hands
3101130 karzais verbal attacks on pakistan and the cabinets decision to suspend relations are just like children playing
3101131 one minute they fight with each other the next minute they make up
3101132 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric
3101133 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
3101134 during the operation 500 foreign taliban including arabs chechens and punjabis were killed
3101135 many locals were displaced and fled to the desert around garmsir or to the provincial capital of lashkar gah we provided assistance to 1 500 families and we held meetings with the tribal elders in garmsir they promised to help with security and now we see that garmsir is safe
3101136 they are just not engaging with us the way they were
3101137 only those areas close to the district center like kharko and hazarajuft are free of them the rest of the district has a lot and they still conduct guerrilla attacks sometimes
3101138 the americans are there in those uniforms with green and brown dots all over cursing the taliban over loudspeakers
3101139 i gave them my identification documents and they pinpointed my house on a map and then they gave me about 90 its not very much but at least they gave me something
3101140 the americans gave money but to only a few people
3101141 and it was very little just 100 or so to each family
3101142 100 to 500 for a destroyed house with this amount people cannot even reconstruct one wall
3101143 we had to flee garmsir with nothing every morning i go to the bazaar and collect leftover food to give to my children sometimes i can find things to eat but other nights we go to sleep hungry
3101144 genetics is the whore child of imperialism the current session has demonstrated the complete triumph of the progressive michurinist direction over the reactionary idealistic mendelism and morganism
3101145 we cannot change our genes but we can create a better environment if we know what conditions gave rise to these or other variations in each individuals genetic code
3101146 without genetics we will not be able to define mans place and potential in the modern world or develop an optimal strategy for dealing with it that could guarantee the prosperity of current and future generations
3101147 in everyday life a host of factors may upset the structure and performance of the genes these factors may cause cancer and hereditary diseases the number is constantly increasing new drugs food products and cosmetics to name but a few
3101148 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3101149 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3101150 i can assure you hand on heart that i know nothing of this whatsoever

3101160 dopo quello che ha fatto saakashvili un uomo che non pu essere incontrato
3101161 non voglio parlare di questioni politiche mentre tskhinvali sotto i bombardamenti ci sono precondizioni prima da rispettare e poi vedremo con chi parleremo nella leadership georgiana
3101162 speriamo che tra i leader georgiani ci siano ancora persone in grado di valutare quanto sta accadendo in maniera adeguata e che abbiano un atteggiamento critico nei confronti di saakashvili li conosciamo e pensano che saakashvili abbia tradito la georgia conducendola in unavventura militare dopo la fine delle ostilit ha continuato lambasciatore russo non escludiamo la possibilit di entrare in contatto con queste persone
3101163 non ha come obiettivo lo spodestamento del presidente mikheil saakahsvili il suo destino nella mani del popolo georgiano
3101164 penso che i russi vogliano arrivare a un golpe mostrando che saakasvhili debole e che deve essere spodestato dichiara ad apcom marshal goldman famoso cremlinologo statunitense tra laltro in questo modo si dimostrerebbe che gli usa sono una tigre di carta e che alla prova dei fatti non sono in grado di garantire i loro protetti
3101165 sono molto sereno perch abbiamo lavorato per questo appuntamento lo slavia una squadra che ha buona organizzazione e corsa una squadra temibile hanno vinto il campionato hanno una mentalit vincente e non sar facile sono le due partite pi importanti della stagione e non posso anticipare nulla sulla formazione la squadra sta meglio rispetto allultima partita anche se ancora non abbiamo novanta minuti nelle gambe laspetto mentale e nervoso comunque giocher tanto e contiamo molto anche sul nostro pubblico che in certe occasioni d sempre il meglio di s vedremo come star gamberini dopo lallenamento per un suo eventuale utilizzo domani dainelli negli ultimi mesi ha avuto qualche problema fisico il capitano lha sempre fatto lui e il fatto che sia qui accanto a me un segnale importante con i rangers non abbiamo commesso grossi errori domani dovremo saper ragionare sui 180 due tre giorni fa ero pi preoccupato oggi sono pi sereno ho visto la squadra motivata carica e con una buona intensit abbiamo migliorato laspetto tecnico con i nuovi arrivi e questo importante ogni settimana vorrei avere molti dubbi sulla formazione ma non dobbiamo commettere lerrore di credere che siamo gi una grande squadra e vero santana uno dei ragazzi che pi in forma e probabilmente sar della partita non possiamo giocare pensando a quella successiva se ci sar loccasione dobbiamo essere pronti fino alla fine non dobbiamo per pensare che ad ogni azione dobbiamo fare gol ma tenere un buon equilibrio mutu un giocatore che in certe partite o in certi allenamenti d limpressione di non essere al meglio ma lui un animale da gara e d il meglio di s in partita gilardino un giocatore importante per noi come tutti gli altri attaccanti gli chiediamo gol come a tutti gli altri abbiamo cambiato tanti giocatori tutti hanno capito da subito la mentalit trasmessa dai vecchi limportante che si vada in campo non da improvvisati ma riproponendo situazioni conosciute le condizioni del campo mi preoccupano perch non per niente in buone condizioni ma lo sar per linizio del campionato

3101168 i worked for two separate recycling companies friedman recycling in phoenix and e l harvey and sons in massachusetts i sold equipment for four years ive done dispatching and sales i have a lot of experience in customer service
3101169 the first thing is getting familiar with the scale and how things operate
3101170 i have a great team here of four people they kept everything up and running during the interim im happy theyre here i rely on them thats the most important thing having a good team
3101171 thats a good place to start i want to make sure were doing everything possible for the safety of the employees the public that uses the station and the environment id like to visit other transfer stations in the area that have similar characteristics and see what kind of things theyre doing
3101172 the town probably quadruples the amount of waste in the summer
3101173 so its good that i came in at a good time to see it really busy and how much the volume increases in the offseason once things slow down we can look at some of the housekeeping things
3101174 the initial thing is to evaluate the audit and the consultants report
3101175 well look at how we can incorporate some of the things here that have been successful i dont want to make change for the sake of change many things here are working well i want it to be a place where its safe to work and know that were doing the best we can for the town its a work in progress
3101176 thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
3101177 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
3101178 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
3101179 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
3101180 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
3101181 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
3101182 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france

3101185 you dont talk about anxiety thats not part of the culture
3101186 the medication were using is the same numbing medication that has been used for decades for pregnant women during labor and delivery
3101187 i found that one part of the brain that works on hot flashes and ptsd is the same the insular cortex
3101188 it resets the nerve system the way god built it
3101189 its a treatment for anxiety that comes out of ptsd
3101190 i noticed i wasnt tense i wasnt looking around i was just calm

3101192 society is obsessed with the idea of talent and genius and people who are naturals with innate ability
3101193 people who believe in the power of talent tend not to fulfill their potential because theyre so concerned with looking smart and not making mistakes but people who believe that talent can be developed are the ones who really push stretch confront their own mistakes and learn from them

3101199 well the first thing id do as president is is sign the freedom of choice act thats the first thing id do
3101200 i strongly disagree with todays supreme court ruling i am extremely concerned that this ruling will embolden state legislatures to enact further measures to restrict a womans right to choose and that the conservative supreme court justices will look for other opportunities to erode roe v wade which is established federal law and a matter of equal rights for women
3101201 asked about his proposal for expanded access to health insurance obama said it would cover reproductive health services contacted afterward an obama spokesperson said that included abortions the obama campaign does not deny senator obama supports taxpayer funded abortions
3101202 he has been a consistent champion of reproductive choice and will make preserving womens rights under roe v wade a priority as president
3101203 you need to come to the office so we can talk about it
3101204 ive never had problems with my other pregnancies so i was shocked
3101205 it took awhile to open up the book that the doctor gave me about children with down syndrome and awhile to log on to the web site and start reading facts about the situation
3101206 its a sign of the times to be able to do this
3101207 there is no reason to believe a woman cant do it with a growing family my baby will not be at all or in any sense neglected
3101208 and there will be strange events in the skies signs in the sun moon and stars and down here on earth the nations will be in turmoil perplexed by the roaring seas and strange tides 26 the courage of many people will falter because of the fearful fate they see coming upon the earth because the stability of the very heavens will be broken up 27 then everyone will see the son of man arrive on the clouds with power and great glory 28 so when all these things begin to happen stand straight and look up for your salvation is near

3101214 every single person working in the media today who experienced the dot com bubble in 1999 to 2000 believes that we are going through the exact same process and can expect the exact same results a bust today everything from youtube to the local church has a social networking angle and this doesnt even consider the actual social networking sites from myspace to linkedin to facebook to even second life this scene is totally out of control and will contribute to the collapse for sure
3101215 i say social networking is an emerging utility that combines the functionality of bloggings self publishing with the usefulness of email list serves social networking services make these activities more accessible than ever before why on earth is this man considered a leading voice on tech im guessing that its because he speaks to the potent paranoia of much of the aging population afraid in the face of a changing confusing world that they will face humiliation if they bet on new tech that they will be unemployed if things take a downturn or that they will lose their self righteous know it all credentials if this new economy does succeed

3101221 niet alle vluchten zijn afgelast sommige maatschappijen zoals brussels airlines slagen erin hun bagage zelf af te handelen anderen leiden hun vluchten dan weer af naar andere luchthavens en voeren hun klanten daar per bus naar toe

3101262 we want them to have their assumptions and opinions challenged
3101263 esperamos conseguir m s xitos de los que hemos conseguido en temporadas anteriores
3101264 las dos veces anteriores no me fui por razones econ micas sino que me fui a equipos que se encontraban m s cerca de ganar la euroliga
3101265 he vivido muy buenas temporadas con fotis en el aek ganamos t tulos juntos creo que est haciendo una gran carrera como entrenador y realmente fue importante saber que estaba aqu l me conoce y sabe lo que puedo hacer hemos hablado muchas veces y ha sido importante al igual que el preparador f sico ioannis merichovitis

3101267 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia
3101268 my grandson screamed uncle putin please help us help us so that the georgians dont kill me they were screaming and crying it was terrible a nightmare
3101269 thank god the russians have come it is getting better
3101270 they the americans of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages
3101271 but the current georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 ossetian villages from the face of the earth the georgian rulers which used tanks to run over children and the elderly which threw civilians into cellars and burnt them they georgian leaders are players that have to be protected
3101272 we had a long night negotiating on some little hurdles and i thought i should raise my fist but he mbeki remained cool and said let us continue talking
3101273 the major hold up is the refusal by mugabe to cede his executive powers he is only agreeing to a nominal prime minister post for morgan tsvangirai
3101274 they zanu pf are also insisting that mutambara becomes one of the deputy prime ministers obviously that is not acceptable to us
3101275 acima de um limite de anos em que a diminui o das chuvas na regi o permita que se cultive a mandioca
3101276 its always fun to get out and play football again
3101277 i felt like we did some good things on offense two really good things were no penalties and no turnovers we did some good things well look at the tape and get better from it
3101278 i dont think mike clayton has dropped a ball all training camp
3101279 hes been sharp so thats not a problem weve got a classy veteran group of receivers and i dont see drops being a problem
3101280 i think he looked pretty good last year with limited understanding of the offense he can be a real weapon for us hes got unbelievable speed and when he gets on the edge youre not going to catch him
3101281 we just have to get used to game speed game tackling and just get honed in
3101282 i think we did a pretty good job everybody was hustling we have a couple of big hits out there but all around we are just trying to get a feel for the game again
3101283 it definitely means a lot especially at the running back position
3101284 a receiver can go in run a great route and make a big catch but as a running back you really need to get into the rhythm of the game you have to know how their defense is playing and how their linebackers are running i think that once you get adjusted to that you can really dictate what theyre going to do
3101285 he had 19 carries saturday and he made a couple mistakes hes got to clean up to be a force hes got to be able to play in every situation i was really pleased the way he ran he had a really good draw showcased his speed and had a couple nice pickups versus the blitz
3101286 they played very well its good clean football no penalties and no turnovers its a real credit to the players and coaches its solid execution we just have to catch the ball a little better and make some more plays
3101287 let this be the last loving thing you do for him
3101288 today christian filmmakers can count on a very savvy pastoral community thats looking to highlight films like these to their congregations
3101289 each one of these christian films is trying to communicate a biblical world view and how its lived out in our society today

3101296 if we choose to do that it would be for two reasons
3101297 one would be to evaluate the package itself and the other would be to make sure we get in the shows not that mcdowell cant bust a lap off because he can but anythings possible
3101298 one of the business objectives we have is keeping that car in the top 35 and we havent been able to do that
3101299 we have a lot of things in the hopper that involve michael
3101300 all of the things were selling are built around michael mcdowell we made a very big investment in him hes a very talented guy i like mike a lot personally and i feel hes really championship caliber
3101301 youll hear some good sangin and some good preechin yought to come on out
3101302 i want to see more test purchasing operations like those being undertaken in birmingham to catch any unscrupulous retailers
3101303 police forces are determined to make inroads into stamping out knife crime and getting weapons off our streets
3101304 operations such as this are considered good practice in tackling unscrupulous and irresponsible shop keepers who are willing to sell knives to young people with the full knowledge that these may then go on to be used as weapons
3101305 a one off crackdown is all very well but labour are still failing to enforce the knife laws we already have
3101306 they talk tough about increasing penalties but in the last five years for which figures are available not a single person has been sent to prison for selling knives to children
3101307 for too long unscrupulous shopkeepers have been allowed to profit from the deadly trade of selling knives to kids
3101308 theres more to life than watching daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3101309 the leprechaun went missing many many months ago and i had forgotten about it
3101310 then i opened the door on thursday and saw he was back it was such a shock
3101311 i thought well its a bit of mischief but at least he hasnt been put through the window
3101312 murphy was quite badly damaged and there was a tightly wrapped parcel next to him my curiosity eventually overcame my alarm because i did wonder if it might explode
3101313 then i saw it was a beautifully bound photo album and opened it up
3101314 his feet were missing but thats no real surprise given that he was sent abseiling down a mountain
3101315 it was the strangest gift i have ever received i just keep thinking how funny it is it makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels it was a wonderful surprise
3101316 hello first of all i feel i should explain my prolonged absence a gnomes life is full of time for reflection and whilst surveying your garden one summer morning i began to get itchy feet
3101317 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3101318 so i decided to free myself from the doldrums of the shire and seek adventure my travels have taken me across three continents 12 countries and more time zones than i can possibly remember
3101319 there have been high points low points and positively terrifying points but i have survived small thanks to the companion with whom i have shared all these moments
3101320 said hello to the big man and he seemed a decent enough bloke but unfortunately i didnt have my camera with me
3101321 any theft of a persons property even if it is carried out as a joke will be treated as a crime by police
3101322 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3101323 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3101324 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything
3101325 it seems just unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3101326 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3101327 clearly elisabeth is a victim in this as well obviously she physically was unscathed having to deal with this has been hard for her she has shown incredible strength the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it
3101328 obviously its a lot of tears and a lot of hugs
3101329 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3101330 not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
3101331 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
3101332 the prime minister was freed monday afternoon along with three other government officials i understand that only the president is still being held
3101333 the six representatives firmly condemned the coup and said it was unacceptable to overthrow a democratically elected president and demanded that the president and his prime minister are set free and constitutional order is restored

3101348 were obviously disappointed that we wont have a chance to take on our arch rivals the misfits in a postseason championship game
3101349 but this is a league decision and well just have to focus on taking out our frustrations on the playing field
3101350 i have been following a rigorous treatment schedule prescribed by our team doctor
3101351 i rub some dirt on my knee twice a day and i can really see the effects so i expect to be ready to go next week
3101352 8 15 pm is kind of late for a game it means i might have to have dinner earlier than normal and i will have to record my favorite tv show rather than watching it live
3101353 but sometimes you just have to make big sacrifices for the team so i plan to be there next week
3101354 every fan will receive a giant foam hand with two fingers raised and the slogan were number 2
3101355 i really do like the fact that no other european has won those two majors consecutively
3101356 because i obviously hold a lot of european players that i grew up watching in high esteem to believe that i achieved something that they hadnt is very special
3101357 i know i love the idea of the back nine of a major of sunday
3101358 i love it so much im actually disappointed im eight months away from the next major
3101359 theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back
3101360 in the bible it says sarah is married to abraham

3101435 the only way i can fight the best is to be where the best is
3101436 hes been around the block hes fought for the ufc heavyweight championship and been in there with the biggest names in there hes a gamer and hes there to fight
3101437 ive always believed that since ive been in the fight game ive felt i could fight the best in the world even if it was five fights ago
3101438 they gave me some opportunities and a fan base where more people could experience how i fight and what kind of fighting style i actually have
3101439 it gave me an opportunity to hone my skills a little more showcase them and the chance to go out there and display the best fighting that i have now hopefully ill just move up to bigger and better guys
3101440 the only side track to the whole affliction thing is is that if tito ortiz does sign with affliction i want to be the first heavyweight he faces

3101451 the last few days hes made some long throws and it got a little achy on him yesterday
3101452 better but its still not where he feels like he can play shortstop
3101453 many of you as i looked into your faces when you saw me coming back youve seen ive changed a little bit first of all i want to apologize to you because youre all going to go through something that no other nfl team will have to endure you will have to see a man walk out before you to his possible death that can be tough and scary but i say possible because im still believing i will be cured regardless of what it looks like my spirit is still strong time is precious man do not make a mistake in thinking this is just another training camp no matter how long you have been in this league make no mistake in understanding that you are blessed to be in this room and that many of you will look at me and some will turn their heads because they just cant look but i want to encourage you to look at me and understand that you have tremendous opportunity to live to play a game that no one else has the opportunity to play from watching that youll get an opportunity to see what true courage is im not strong im weak just like you but because of my faith in jesus christ i know im going to come out ok regardless each and every one of you will deal with something in your life that challenges you and its going to continue to be that way because not everything goes perfect but i want to encourage you every time you look at me do not give into your circumstance do not give in to weariness do not give in to soreness and if you do not do that you will have something special before its all said and done
3101454 many of you as i looked into your faces when you saw me coming back youve seen ive changed a little bit
3101455 first of all i want to apologize to you because youre all going to go through something that no other nfl team will have to endure
3101456 you will have to see a man walk out before you to his possible death that can be tough and scary but i say possible because im still believing i will be cured regardless of what it looks like my spirit is still strong
3101457 no matter what you think youre going through in your life there are men who are sacrificing more and facing greater challenges than you ever really will
3101458 people say we have the toughest training camp in the nfl but there has not been a single complaint because we have heard a testimony from a man who has more strength than any of us he is a walking testimony to the power a man can have

3101460 im going to take this one step further im going to give it to o j

3101585 if one were a flea market operator and you become aware that counterfeiting is going on with the individual sellers at the flea market you have a duty to investigate it
3101586 the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders

3101588 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting the best way to stop counterfeiting is ongoing collaboration between companies government agencies and law enforcement

3101593 weve started this website because were tired of seeing the tilton organization play the blame game to glenn and his staff responsibility for uniteds predicament belongs to everyone and everything other than themselves
3101594 the unions call for tiltons departure widens the rift between the worlds second largest airline and its pilots

3101625 we have conceded 31 goals which is six or seven too many its as close as that to win the championship
3101626 we didnt give more goals away than any other team in the league on open play nor on set pieces but where we gave more goals away was on direct balls in the air through the middle and most of the time on second balls
3101627 on set pieces and open play we were as good as manchester united and chelsea the numbers are available but we have to rectify how we deal with direct balls when a team just goes for long direct balls against us we have to improve
3101628 i will try to buy maybe in the defensive area and one on the creative side of the game as well because we had some players important players who were out this year

3101671 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3101672 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3101673 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3101674 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3101675 menos de cuatro a os probablemente sea menos de tres a os
3101676 it is important to note that the survival of gt goes beyond just the capital as it is being speculated by a section of the public
3101677 we believe vodafone has the international clout in the telecom industry worldwide which gt can leverage on when it comes to international transactions and compete effectively with mtn zain glo tigo and kasapa which are all multinationals
3101678 otherwise by the time gt raises capital from the stock exchange as has been suggested by some people there will be no new customers to be acquired and even gts existing customers would have been taken over
3101679 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3101680 we are 100 per cent certain there will be a demo for xbox 360 99 per cent certain there will be a demo for ps3 and about 50 per cent certain there will be a demo for pc
3101681 im still not certain exactly when the best time to release the demo will be there are two camps one camp believes we should continue to focus 100 per cent of our attention on the few remaining issues
3101682 people working on those issues instead were working on a demo the whole process would take a little longer we have branched our demo builds however so were committed to them pretty much
3101683 were still learning about the trophy system for ps3 by some accounts sony will take care of things by others we can get involved and do them ourselves i care about this kind of stuff so you can bet that well make a decision as sony releases the trophy system
3101684 our game was in certification with sony prior to them launching the trophy system so its something well have to re visit or we could just delay the game again joking
3101685 oh and i dont wanna die for you but if dyings asked of me ill bear that cross with honor cause freedom dont come free im an american soldier
3101686 much too fun to waste on just one set of game rules
3101687 these poll results demonstrate that parents are as apprehensive about their childrens media diets as they are about traditional social issues such as alcohol drugs violence and sex
3101688 over the past six months pilgrims pride has taken a number of proactive steps to strengthen our competitive position amid a very difficult operating environment
3101689 these steps include the production cutbacks for the second half of fiscal 2008 the closure of a plant in north carolina and seven distribution centers and the consolidation of our tray pack operations in el dorado ark to six other case ready sites those changes when combined with todays announcement will result in the elimination of nearly 2 300 positions
3101690 la m s grande historia de amor jam s contada
3101691 if we continue to play like that the offense will always come
3101692 we played them in the last olympics and then in the world championships
3101693 the difference between 2004 and 2006 its like they have these tendencies that traditional chinese teams have had which is a lot of movement i mean a lot of movement penetration cutting pass pass pass pass very quick
3101694 and then tom maher got here and he put in a western kind of style now you see their original style mixed with his its hard to guard i know you look at the score and we played well but theyre going to be a tough opponent for anybody they face in this tournament
3101695 but i think now most everybody plays the same way give or take so the old thing about you can play like asia well who does that anymore youve got to play international style basketball and you have to be a defensive team or youre going to get killed
3101696 we were a bit frightened shed get 50 on us
3101697 but what could we do could we double team her and let candace parker and katie smith and diana taurasi run in layups on us
3101698 it could be any one of us at any time any night
3101699 we want to win and we dont necessarily care about the margin we care about the effort
3101700 they made it seem like we were only up by a couple
3101701 it almost made us anxious like gosh we better score here
3101702 estos iban a ser mis ltimos juegos y no creo que siga compitiendo
3101703 me toc la china como a veces ocurre en el arbitraje y me lo he llevado yo

3101714 various economic indicators from home prices to consumer confidence business sentiment and retail sales all suggest serious problems in the u s europe and more recently parts of asia including japan
3101715 moreover shipping volumes and passenger air traffic out of allegedly strong china and india suggests far more trouble than is generally believed
3101716 while some post olympics bounce is possible the far larger consumers of commodities in the u s canada and europe could weaken further restraining global demand and commodity prices
3101717 accordingly we would not try to bargain hunt at this juncture within the industrials energy or materials sectors but would rather sell into strength

3101726 i am here as part of my mission to garner support from donors to be able to facilitate more rwandan coffee farmers whose production would find retail outlets in the united states the middle east and high consumer markets
3101727 rwandan coffee is very highly regarded by professional coffee tasters and judges but typically farmers just sell their coffee they could fetch more profit if the coffee was roasted and processed here
3101728 we demand the best for our children even if you dont
3101729 although racism is a familiar subject to many the discussion of institutional racism may be overwhelming stressful or shocking to others we believe however that it is important to understand both intentional and unintentional racism if we are going to create educational environments that support the high academic achievement of african american children as professor asa hilliard continues to tell us in speech after speech many african american students have reached and continue to reach high levels of academic achievement our failure to replicate thes e successes has a great deal to do with institutional racism

3101756 july 18 would be the 17th birthday of wade edwards of raleigh please use the attached coupon to celebrate his birthday with an ice cream or treat from the pullen park concession stand
3101757 the gift you can give in wades name is to do something nice for someone else
3101758 it occurred to us later that this would have been a happy way to celebrate wades birthday if he had lived instead the delight on the faces of the children as they returned from the concession stand with ice cream treats was a sad reminder of what it might have been had wade lived
3101759 it was a mistake they were sorry it would never happen again in fact they would not play amazing grace in september or in april the month grace died
3101760 the only tree in the mans section of the cemetery had fallen and it had fallen across the grave of his father his pain and helplessness were overwhelming i made a small bouquet from the flowers at wades grave and took them to him he usually brought something for the grave but that day he was empty in every way sometimes we pressed on as if we were not weakened and then we saw ourselves in someone else
3101761 soon people were lifting pant legs or the cuffs of sleeves to show the small scars on their babies
3101762 so that i literally held grace day and night for the first year of her life

3101765 el presidente medvedev dice que tiene un deber constitucional de intervenir para proteger a los ciudadanos rusos
3101766 pero la obligaci n de proteger a las personas independientemente de la ciudadan a corresponde al estado en el que estas se encuentran
3101767 los intentos de aplicar esa doctrina han sumido a europa en la guerra por eso es tan importante que se desestime el recurso a este argumento
3101768 en cuanto a georgia rusia ha generosa y deliberadamente entregado pasaportes a los habitantes tanto en osetia del sur como de abjasia es evidente que esto es era fue parte de una pol tica de vinculaci n de estas regiones m s cerca de rusia
3101769 pero si ahora se utiliza para legitimar los actos militares de agresi n contra georgia
3101770 el hecho de que ello conduzca a una profunda preocupaci n en muchos pa ses es clara pasaportes rusos se pueden encontrar en varios pa ses adem s de georgia y todos estos pa ses ahora se sienten tanto pol tica como militarmente amenazados por aquello en lo que ven como una agresiva y arrogante rusia
3101771 la misma doctrina de entregar pasaportes rusos y luego reclamar el territorio porque en l viven sus nacionales en otras situaciones ha sido sumamente peligrosa
3101772 nosotros no aceptamos que la serbia de milosevic interviniera militarmente en otros ex estados diciendo que era para proteger a aquellos que ten an pasaporte serbio
3101773 las consecuencias pol ticas de la operaci n rusa ser n sustanciales para europal
3101774 ahora es importante para exigir el cese inmediato de los bombardeos a reos que las tropas rusas que entraron en georgia se retire de inmediato y que los contactos pol ticos para una soluci n pac fica que deban tomarse

3101786 i did the right things to come out on top
3101787 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
3101788 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
3101789 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
3101790 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
3101791 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mindset
3101792 ill tell you something his confidence got back thats why i took him out of the game i wasnt going to let him lose the game he was leaving on a high note and theres four left handed hitters standing there i wasnt going to give him a chance to get hit he already pitched a good game and did a good job
3101793 well it aint star wars but its slightly edgy space opera with a bigger budget than most such movies get so its kinda fun

3101804 in this months report manufacturers indicate no change in overall business activity when comparing july to june
3101805 this continues a trend biased toward relatively minor contraction established more than 12 months ago manufacturing has maintained a reasonable level of activity during a period in which other sectors of the economy have been in recession
3101806 while the pmi indicates little to no change has occurred during this period it would be hard to convince manufacturers who are faced with higher costs and uncertain demand that there is little change taking place
3101807 the past relationship between the pmi and the overall economy indicates that the average pmi for january through july 49 4 corresponds to a 2 6 increase in real gross domestic product gdp
3101808 in addition if the pmi for july 50 is annualized it corresponds to a 2 8 increase in real gdp annually

3101810 the prominent part played by song and music in the worship of the temple as arranged by david is readily explained by his poetic and musical abilities his skill in music is recorded in i kings xvi 18 and amos vi 5 poems of his composition are found in ii kings i iii xxii xxiii his connection with the book of psalms many of which are expressly attributed to various incidents of his career was so taken for granted in later days that many ascribed the whole psalter to him
3101811 after his sin with bethsabee and the indirect assassination of urias her husband david made her his wife a year elapsed before his repentance for the sin but his contrition was so sincere that god pardoned him though at the same time announcing the severe penalties that were to follow the spirit in which david accepted these penalties has made him for all time the model of penitents

3101863 our general position is that sharia law cannot be used as a justification for committing breaches of english law nor should the principles of sharia law be included in a civil court for resolving contractual disputes

3101865 equality before the law is part of the glue that binds our society together we cannot have a situation where there is one law for one person and different laws for another

3101867 we the leaders of once captive nations of eastern europe and now eu and nato members estonia latvia lithuania and poland express a deep concern over the russian federations actions toward georgia

3101874 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3101875 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california

3101881 were here to prevent heart disease deaths with early detection and treatment
3101882 most women ignore all the warning signs thinking theyre more likely to get breast cancer the truth is women are nearly 10 times more likely to die from heart disease than breast cancer and many times more likely to develop heart disease which will impact their quality of life
3101883 when dr cahill got here a year ago we started brainstorming about what we could do specifically for the women in our area
3101884 we knew we had to provide an educational forum for women that also offered testing to be worthwhile
3101885 this had been a tremendous source of frustration in my practice in the past because no one listened to me about symptoms and heart disease
3101886 the women really open up they tell sheryl things they havent even told their doctors
3101887 women are more likely to think they have indigestion or fatigue when theyre having a heart attack
3101888 women are used to not feeling 100 percent and the impact of that means more women are having heart attacks and ignoring them until its too late
3101889 we discuss all the results and set up a plan to improve their health
3101890 we emphasize risk factor identification and modification based on american heart association guidelines this is not just major education for these women its also hand holding and cheerleading often it means a real lifestyle change and thats hard
3101891 the team work was most important sometimes we received ten dead puppies a day we are working with several veterinarians and are receiving samples from cases with a history of vaccine failure
3101892 diagnostic laboratories need to be involved to identify cpv 2c the disease now exists in all countries except australia because of its geographical isolation
3101893 i want the university to give me more money so i can hire more lab monkeys so i can become more influential on campus and publish more press releases like this one
3101894 veterinarians are confused because the in office diagnostic tests come up negative
3101895 clinically it looks like parvovirus so they send it to us the oaddl tests it and it is parvovirus now world wide except for australia this particular variant can attack the heart and intestines
3101896 we will continue to study cpv 2c through collaborations with others we will search for more effective vaccines
3101897 it is understood that the benchmark for associates to reach in order to keep their jobs is significantly higher than in previous appraisals
3101898 we were pretty close in the end we were only five points down with a pretty average performance
3101899 we didnt miss anything big we just didnt have any big hits like were used to
3101900 i dont pay attention to my competition to where we are in the standings

3101904 orania is not an impulse but a reply is a weakness and strength at the same time a weakness because people tend to react more easily and quickly on impulse even if it means jumping from the frying pan into the fire a strength because a well thought out answer stands the test of time much better and proves its value over a period of time but what is the question to which orania wants to be the answer to know this is to know why orania continues to grow albeit slowly for that reason different perspectives are offered around the questions the afrikaner is facing by rejecting some blacks ed and accepting others whites ed it also clearly indicates what kind of answer orania wants to be
3101905 police profiling based on a persons accent such as a white person speaking with an hispanic accent or dressed in a particular manner such as a member of a sect or religious tradition results in perceptions by individuals and groups that the law does not operate fairly judging each man or woman on the basis of his or her conduct t he targeted individuals and groups believe that justice depends on race or ethnic identity and therefore our institutions of justice cannot and should not be trusted
3101906 racial and ethnic profiling does not include the use of racial or ethnic characteristics as part of a physical description of a particular person observed by police or other witnesses to be a participant in a crime or other violation of law

3101918 any kind of relief or help we can get from a cheaper source of oil could impact the agricultural industry tremendously throughout the country throughout the world
3101919 but certainly we have the ability and we have shown that over and over again that we can beat people on technology and applying that technology
3101920 even under harsh drought conditions with minimal amount of water or moisture it will survive
3101921 it think its going to be part of the equation
3101922 in the next four or five years i think well increase not only the fruits per jatropha tree but well also increase the amount of oil in each of those seeds
3101923 there are implications to dedicating more and more crop land to fuel production rather than food production
3101924 that comes in the form of tighter supplies for food production and that leads to higher prices
3101925 we have to have these machines running if we dont have these machines running and we dont have diesel fuel we dont produce our crops
3101926 to be a better america we are going to have to have a secondary source besides oil

3101932 in 1942 the hutchins commission on freedom of the press was established to consider press regulations the most innovative outcome of this commission was the development of social responsibility theory which was a call for media to be responsible in fostering productive and creative opportunities two conditions made these changes possible first an increased presence in governments management of the news since world war ii and second the adversary culture of the 1960s which did not trust government and therefore encouraged journalists to be more aggressive the tension affected science reporting leading to conflict between scientists who wrote for professional scientific or medical journals and journalists who wrote science or medical stories for popular press the conflict arose in part from sourcing professional scientists were concerned with cautious accuracy their claims grounded in empirical data or substantiated by previous literature while journalists were concerned primarily with newsworthiness increased government funding for scientific endevours set up scientists for the same type of scrutiny as government institutions these conflicts have attracted scholarly attention and debate

3101944 before i had a summer job i spent a lot of time lying around the house feeling like my summer days were slipping by me and i was completely wasting them during the summer months many teenagers without licenses or jobs have no specific way to occupy their time even though sleeping in and watching daytime television is fun for the first few weeks it gets old quickly and suddenly youre left with an endless amount of time to fill while you parents are at work
3101945 it is a great group to share similar thoughts and learn new things
3101946 if you want to be with spiritual oriented people i would recommend this meetup group tonight was my first meeting
3101947 i looked the man in the eye i found him to be very straight forward and trustworthy and we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul hes a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country and i appreciate very much the frank dialogue and thats the beginning of a very constructive relationship
3101948 when someone dies it is natural to mourn their loss to think of them with sorrow and miss their presence in your life if they died from a natural death from disease or old age then the dying would be understandable this is not the case with unnatural dying when someone close dies an unnatural death you not only mourn their loss but are forced to adjust to the unnatural way that they died
3101949 we have subtly shifted some of our messaging on some of these key iconic brands
3101950 i think cereal as a category is very well positioned even as consumers come under a fair amount of pressure
3101951 i think our portfolio is very well positioned for consumers looking to save money
3101952 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
3101953 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
3101954 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
3101955 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
3101956 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
3101957 i think we will see a definite shift toward local foods and other ways to stretch the food dollar while still maintaining healthy meals for children
3101958 for me as a registered dietitian this is a perfect time to make portion control a focus
3101959 obviously if we can bring portion sizes down to a more appropriate level it will help tremendously with expenses this is a great opportunity for schools to examine healthy portion sizes which not only improve the health of students but cut down on costs as well
3101960 districts will probably need to do more seasonal thinking when it comes to food choices
3101961 while fresh berries might be too expensive in the winter at some schools oranges or grapefruit might not
3101962 schools have access to federal allocation for fresh fruits and vegetables
3101963 but since the amount is limited the district may find it difficult to keep fresh produce on their menus throughout the year
3101964 economically its a great way to keep produce on school menus longer
3101965 i suspect that for most districts it is going to be a challenge even with their creativity because food costs have just taken off
3101966 using local foods helps with environmental sustainability and cuts down greatly on shipping costs
3101967 it also increases the likelihood of getting a fresher product
3101968 the food that goes into these kids is what fuels their academics
3101969 this is a great opportunity to examine how we give them the best food for their best performance and to do it in a way that makes fiscal sense

3101993 where by al lah have you been why were you alone with a man who is not your husband
3101994 it is no wonder that aisha rhymes with fahisha whore
3101995 galloping through the center of town with her hands on another man and her hair waving like a harlots dress
3101996 a harlot with vomit stinking breath and hair like a birds nest
3101997 i am happy to see her alive praise al lah
3101998 yaa habibati what reward should i offer safwan ibn for bringing you home safely to me
3101999 apparently umar thinks i should have been left at the mercy of the jackals or the bedouins
3102000 i heard him moments ago reciting a damning poem about your wife and that womanizing soldier
3102001 im the wife of holy prophet would i want a nobody like him
3102002 medina churns with sickness over your ruin aisha men are fighting in the streets over your guilt or innocence our own people have turned against one another the unity of the umma is threatened because of you
3102003 how can i defend her when safwan himself will not speak on her behalf
3102004 my father gave it to me on my wedding day remember
3102005 it means as much to me as the necklaces youve given your other wives
3102006 i searched my clothing the floorboards of my howdah the ground i would have asked the driver to help me but he was watering the camels
3102007 i followed my path back to the dunes i sifted the sands with my fingers then when i was about to give up i found it i ran back to the caravan but you were far away like ants crawling single file into tomorrow i knew i could never catch you so i sat down to wait for someone to come back for me
3102008 you waste our time with this fantasy while we all know the real story
3102009 as the sun rose i found shade under a grove of date palm trees
3102010 i lay down keeping cool then i must have slept because the next thing i remember is safwans hand on my shoulder
3102011 did you hear that prophet safwan ibn is now touching your wife we all know where that leads
3102012 i felt a sharp cramp like a knife in my stomach
3102013 i couldnt travel not while i was doubled over with pain so safwan pitched his tent for me to rest in out of the sun
3102014 and where was safwan while you were lying in his tent
3102015 i retched for hours safwan tried to help me he gave me water and fanned me with a date palm frond finally he became frightened and we came back for help
3102016 why was safwan lagging so far behind the caravan was it because he knew you would be waiting for him under the date palms
3102017 to watch for the return of the mustaliq to their camp
3102018 i have loved her since she sprang from her mothers womb i have played dolls with her and her friends i have drunk from the same bowl with her
3102019 not a little girl anymore although many years younger than you safwan is much closer to her age
3102020 then let us find a more suitable place to talk
3102021 i am not leaving you habibati but i have decided to send you to your parents house for a while abu bakr and umm ruman will nurse you back to health al lah willing away from all these wagging tongues
3102022 a scandal like this could tear it apart you must act now cousin send her back to abu bakr for good
3102023 i would just as soon cut out my own heart
3102024 you need to distance yourself from her before this scandal marks you also many men in this town would love to see you fall
3102025 i know you can then why do you look so worried wives are easily acquired you will find another child bride

3102043 ms kanaga a dynamic east african farmer in her late thirties she started cultivating rice during the last growing season but before becoming involved in this new agricultural enterprise she spoke with her neighbours who had recently introduced rice into their farming system she also spoke with the village womens farmer group the local extension worker the local credit and savings bank the local materials supplier and an ngo focused on enterprise development and she listened to a local radio programme on agriculture at that point she became slightly confused because the information from these various sources was not always the same
3102044 information on agricultural activities can be confusing or contradictory and requires a lot of perseverance to obtain a recent trend is that agricultural advisory services are sometimes outsourced or contracted out since outsourcing advisory services is rather new not much is known about how it can best be implemented or the conditions under which it is helpful this bulletin discusses several cases concerning extension outsourcing so that we can learn how it can benefit farmers like ms kanaga
3102045 research findings in digital form can nowadays be easily moved around duplicated handed to others worked on with new tools merged with other data divided up in new ways stored in vast volumes and manipulated by supercomputers if their nature so demands there is now widespread recognition that data are a valuable long term resource and that sharing them and making them publicly available is essential if their potential value is to be realised
3102046 two essential reasons for making research data publicly available first to make them part of the scholarly record that can be validated and tested second so that they can be re used by others in new research
3102047 the 15 centers supported by the cgiar and their many national partners are together creating a wealth of knowledge that can help rural communities in developing countries build sustainable livelihoods yet formidable obstacles to uptake and use of generated knowledge as well as impact of cgiar agricultural research remain one of the missing elements which has reduced the effectiveness of our research and development r amp d efforts is appropriate and effective knowledge sharing both within centers and between them and their partners

3102074 just assuming that higher oil prices mean that it is assumed that oil companies have vested interest in pushing these prices up has anyone wondered whos got to lose most when the oil price reach unrealistic values it is the oil companies who also refine the oil and a high oil prices actually hurt their refinery margins and could lead to a loss

3102276 we received a strongly worded petition addressed to the commissioner of police in charge of sfu mr olayinka balogun from access bank nigeria plc regarding about n34 million automated machine fraud atm being perpetrated by an ambrose alli university student
3102277 the copy of the petition stated further that one ehimea on several occasions manipulated the atm machine of the banks branch at 43b evifa bufu road benin city and his access card visa with number 4751 7500 0003 to withdraw the sums between april and june this year upon receiving a copy of the petition we swung into investigation
3102278 what i illegally withdrew was not n34 million but n20 million
3102279 one morning that i needed to cash money from the bank with my access bank visa card i spotted the faulty machine i discovered that each time i withdrew money my account would not be debited so i just kept on withdrawing
3102280 but each time i withdrew some money my account was credited again i was always scared but i would collect it rush back to the banking hall and re credit my account i did this several times that i could not even remember

3102288 we hold the view that pas cannot be two face on this matter as it smacks the worst form of hypocrisy from a party that holds islam as the centre piece of its political struggle in the country after the euphoria of the march 8 election malaysians will have plenty to worry about their hopes on pakatan rakyat when pas as a component party of the opposition coaliton and pkr having a member of parliament took an uncompromising stand to prevent a fraternity of malaysian lawyers to initiate discussion among malaysians on the conflicting issues that affect their lives arising from concerns in the federal constitution for political point scoring we have also leaders in the government such as the home minister syed hamid albar and the deputy prime minister najib razak whose statements seem to condone the actions of these unruly protesters government had deliberately allowed the incident to happen
3102289 you represent umno i represent the muslims muslims must act based on the quran and sunnah sayings of the prophet we must behave well muslims must not be rude im ashamed of your behaviour islam does not condone this he said if i sit down means i am supporting this the fact is if you sit down it means you are listening and you can contribute and explain things to people it does not necessarily mean you agree with any views that are posed on islam
3102290 i want to throw a challenge to the prime minister amend the law to show you are sincere about resolving the issue and dont dolak dalik be wishy washy and pretend there are all kinds of reasons you cant do it if you really want to resolve the issue amend the constitution we can amend that section to say even the party who converts should be allowed to apply for divorce that way he or she can resolve matters with his or her non muslim family because when the civil court grants a divorce to the non muslim spouse the court can also make orders for custody maintenance division of property and so on as it is now you can do this under the civil law provided the non muslim spouse applied but if you amend it to let the muslim spouse to also apply maybe he or she can then resolve issues with a non muslim spouse before entering into another marriage that is what he or she should do islam does not condone the behaviour of abandoning your family and certainly we as muslims do not want anybody to make use of islam to get out of their obligations that would be wrong from the perspective of islam if we explain the right things to the non muslims they would not be afraid or worried and will understand islam better but if we act harshly and rudely like some of those who came to stop the forum people will think this is what islam is
3102291 we regret that unfortunately the fiercest among them was someone known to be a lawyer and member of parliament who pretentiously claimed himself to be representing all muslims
3102292 we take seriously the rough action by a small band of the demonstrators who shouted rude and uncivilised language against some of the organisers and participants of the seminar
3102293 in view of the sensitive reactions and wrong perception among a section of the malay muslim population
3102294 we are in full support of holding inter religious dialogues that promote understanding rather than unilateral events that could create ethnic and religious dissension
3102295 it bar council should have acted wisely and speedily to announce that the seminar would be held behind closed door to avoid any unhealthy consequence on inter ethnic and inter religious relations in this country
3102296 its all because of you girl its all because of you
3102297 unfortunately we see more more money leaving our shores every day
3102298 just last week i was on the phone to a person who had sent 585 000 believing he was involved with a pipeline business venture with nigerian government officials
3102299 this was an intelligent articulate man who was successfully self employed yet i had difficulty persuading him not to send any more money
3102300 queensland represents around one fifth of all fraud victims so its a huge problem for all states
3102301 offenders are focusing more on higher volume but lower value transactions theyve become more technical in their processes and are using black market web portals to obtain data and theyre working closely with organised groups such as russian gangs
3102302 but romance scams are the big new threat were seeing a great deal of energy being put into victimising people through online dating websites
3102303 and that doesnt take into account the money that goes to ghana the ivory coast amsterdam london tokyo new york or russia
3102304 while everyone has heard of the nigerian letters theres almost a belief that its not a scam because the money is going to ghana
3102305 thats why were now calling it advance fee fraud this is not just about nigeria its a global phenomenon
3102306 weve had cases of australians who have brought complaints to us but when weve investigated the scammers are not nigerian nationals theyre not based there and the money has actually been directed to ghana spain the netherlands anywhere really
3102307 the big players dont want to do business in nigeria any more
3102308 weve had people fly from brisbane to amsterdam singapore and london to attend business meetings with scammers
3102309 its no longer simply the money people are going with it
3102310 people are hopping on a plane and going to deal in third countries that brings the real risk of physical harm
3102311 you dont have to be very sophisticated to do this its just a matter of sending emails and trying to persuade people to give you money
3102312 theyre not using spyware they dont want to hack into your system or bank account they simply contact you and promise a share of millions if you pay certain fees that will let them access the money
3102313 we know romance victims have been set up as mules for the transportation of heroin into australia or persuaded to transfer stolen funds or property generally under the guise of doing a favour for a friend
3102314 you know ive just bought a laptop that i cant get in nigeria ill have it delivered to your address can you please on forward it to me in lagos of course the laptop would have been purchased over the internet using a stolen or compromised credit card
3102315 often people are asked to take a suitcase back with them for a friend and its been lined with heroin and there are instances where people have been asked to cash cheques to pay for a visit of course its a faked cheque and several months down the track the victim discovers its fraudulent and the financial institution wants them to refund that money
3102316 not only may they lose their savings assets and possessions but the experience is extremely traumatic
3102317 there may have been an online relationship for six months before the actual sting so people end up emotionally destroyed and theres whole of social impacts such as loss of self esteem or ill health
3102318 n o pode se preocupar com uma pesquisa e mudar sua pol tica econ mica
3102319 this one had a real person an auckland phone contact and even another local winner for me to verify with
3102320 at first the amount they asked for was small so i didnt mind paying to try to get the money but after i had paid over 45 748 and they asked for another 68 400 that is when i realised i had been tricked
3102321 of course we are all aware of the nigerian scams where scammers are based in nigeria but i was less suspicious because these people spoke chinese and had local auckland telephone numbers
3102322 since the victims are chinese i just consider what i lost as payment for a very expensive lesson

3102364 were still considering their request but havent given a definitive answer
3102365 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived
3102366 they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of they way the reproduce

3102381 we started writing new songs for this album the first week of january while simultaneously planning a mid west tour of america in february and recording our comin atcha live 2008 dvd while we were on the road coming home in march we hired terry to jump back into writing and recording music with us while we edited the dvd and routed a summer tour of europe were riding a wave of energy that doesnt come easy for a band of rookies much less a band whose been doing this for over 20 years and we wouldnt have it any other way
3102382 we jumped right back into the studio to work on forever more with terry while setting up a tour of american festival shows in july and august playing alongside bands such as matchbox twenty the wallflowers queensr che kiss and judas priest its great that we can play with any band of any music genre because weve never been pigeon holed into a style or label of music throughout our career

3102386 true true i do believe his name was either keith or something along that line he was really out of it he kept mumbling about something like a monster was going to get him hm oh well a loon like that is better left alone
3102387 i need you to be sure of his name was it keith or not there is a man named keith i wish to kill before i die did he have a birthmark on the back of his left hand in the shape of a dragon
3102388 what kind of dragon there are at least five different species of dragons i know of
3102389 a wyrm dragon all his family members have the wyrm dragon as a birthmark ben places his left hand on the right side of his ribcage just like my famliy has a birthmark in the shape of griffon and a crescent moon in close proximity
3102390 i didnt see a wyrm dragon birthmark but it was a dragon and it was on his face around his left eye it was a serpentine dragon
3102391 not anyone i know now which way do we go for these ruins that could hold the tome inside
3102392 its that mountain range just up ahead it would have been hard if we didnt have these wonderful weapons
3102393 why did you touch your mark you only do that when you think of the past or are troubled
3102394 i was thinking of the past nothing to worry about
3102395 its our birthmark everyone in our village has a birthmark that is special to their fathers bloodline for example if a girl was born to a villager with a cat as their mark but marry a man with a wolf as his mark their children will bear the mark of the wolf their fathers bloodline same is true with me and brother if and when we have children they will have the birthmark of the griffon and moon
3102396 well the moon is close to the griffon so we just count it as one its been like that for a long time moves shirt sleeve reveals birthmark this is what it looks like even though we have the same bloodline brothers moon is in a different location compared to mine i dont remember where it is though but i do remember father and mother saying that brothers mark was special
3102397 akamaru village that is why your birthmarks are so wonderful that village has such a magnificiant hot spring a while ago ben and trent look at artemis dont look at me like that i know of akamaru village because my name is artemis akamaru lifts left pant leg reveals wolf like you said trent a wolf and cat will give birth to a wolf i left the village before ben was even two
3102398 that explains why you know so much about akamaru the hot spring dried up five years ago
3102399 well there goes my idea of returning for a dip after the magos are either in control or defeated
3102400 akamaru is destroyed the magos invaded the valley and killed almost all the villagers
3102401 almost all of them well there are the three of us do you know if anyone else is alive
3102402 keith and mister koron are possibly still alive keith killed so many villagers with a lightning spell and mister koron did nothing to stop him
3102403 wait koron that guy couldnt harm a fly much less his own brother he probably broke inside after seeing his own flesh helping in destroying their home and fellow villagers dont hold a grudge against koron he was a good friend of mine i may not look like it but im just a year older then koron
3102404 but koron was 21 when we last saw him you look like you are only 17
3102405 thats because of a spell that went wrong the idiot pronounced the wrong syllable and ended up reversing his age instead of reversing the water flow of a river
3102406 its dark in there how do we find our way in there
3102407 are you sure there are no scorpions snakes or spiders down there
3102408 last time i was here there was only a snake but i had him for lunch its friends might have moved in by now
3102409 i hate snakes they are so long and gross with their tongues
3102410 dont worry as long as im here i wont let any snakes get near you besides if i focus my light spell on the snake or snakes they will be temporarily blinded because they dont have eyelids thats how i got the best of the first snake
3102411 i dont hear any snakes or scorpions both have distinctive sounds and with the limited range of light i cant see any spiders so i think we are in the clear
3102412 see what i mean about them being living weapons only living weapons can fly up to the holes up there
3102413 artemis you are an idiot there arent seven holes there are eight of them seven holes around one you didnt notice it because its in the space between the doors two parts even if we had the seven keys they would be worthless without the eighth one
3102414 well that is odd the tome of the seventh warrior needing eight keys is strange lands on ground ben the text is over on this side of the door take a look
3102415 the freak is right i cant read it but you said you translated the text earlier artemis was that a lie
3102416 not a complete lie i know who wrote this here points to bottom of text ive seen this name written before bartimus omega hinsu the seventh warriors true name
3102417 its not you its your blade that thing is vibrating like crazy
3102418 ok that is strange i can read the text now can you guys trent and the others shake their heads it reads to those who wish to obtain the power of those who defeated the evil queen of the past i beseech you to find another way to solve your problems but if you are in dire trouble the seven keys will calm the beast and the power will be given to the ones that are destined to have it bartimus omega hinsu wow a riddle and i have a feeling that the beast is my blade
3102419 well i have a good idea now of where to go if i am correct two of the keys are either travelling together or are in close proximity to each other
3102420 and you arent going to thank anyone for the help
3102421 eager to hear from men as well as women of all ages and backgrounds
3102422 this weekend my sister was traveling back to great falls from helena and had her son and her sons friend with her two 13 year old boys

3102424 wennemer will not do anything that will lead to a lasting destruction in shareholder value
3102425 it hurts my feelings when i was hoping we could figure out a new way to handle the situation together
3102426 i know were close and we can share everything but id really appreciate it if youd leave the room or leave me out when you do that its not very sexy and i dont want anything that makes you less sexy to me
3102427 i have been reseaching and ive found that insert absurd percentage here of abortions are repeats so that means two three sometimes four abortions for the same woman thats whole families like ours that could have been but arent its really got me thinking

3102438 my name is artemis im a mage im not part of magos oscuros and the ikaniaei spell should be wearing off in about five minutes oh my flying shield is called blunt
3102439 nice to meet yall coatl fair hellia and the monstrousity who can be heard for meters away lets be friends
3102440 dont worry about your husband hell be ok hes just frozen right now
3102441 i am sorry for that assumption i figured that the boy rolling on the ground is this mans brother with the way they fought just now in sync the like only family can obtain and since you are about his age i only thought the only reasonable idea a girl would be following them is that she is in love with one of them and since you were scared when i froze him i thought that you were his lover
3102442 youre not the sharpest tool in the shed are you blunt
3102443 huh what are you talking about hellia sama i was just saying that baa chan should forgive my master because he has a problem people call
3102444 and you have that problem too do you even know what baa chan means
3102445 nee san dont be mad at him there was a person in our village with the same problem of course he actually could put his foot into his mouth that was very fun to watch as his wife chased him while he hopped away on one foot
3102446 you are lucky that you said you are not a mago but a mage is on the razor edge of becoming a mago
3102447 so true i had lots of time to think about it i thought of joining them once but i decided against it i have so much fun using my magic the way i want i dont want to be tied down by orders
3102448 do you know anything of the tome of the seventh warrior
3102449 in fact i know a place that could hold it but the only problem is that is needs seven keys and the keys are shaped like weapons in fact if i translated the ruins text correctly it said that the weapons would be alive and their partners will be powerful magicians
3102450 well you have to deal with us i am in the shape of one of the keyholes and fair lady hellia sama is also shaped like one of the keyholes
3102451 if you ever talk after i think of something to myself again i will slice you in two i dont care if you are a key to the tome i would rather deal with a shield that cant read minds
3102452 sorry about that i should have explained that blunt can read minds he can also display dreams of those that are dreaming its a fun thing to do ben trent and ashley look at artemis ill promise not to use that if you allow me to travel with you
3102453 i dont mind if you come but if you use that dream thingy on me i will hit you so hard your fourth generation will feel it
3102454 if you have a key guess we cant dismiss you that quickly for now take us to this place with the seven keyholes
3102455 sorry about that i forgot about the seal huja huna there that should allow that wonderful blade of yours to be released
3102456 i saw how you use the flying blade to kill those magos while you were still on it quite impressive i want to know more about that wonderful blade
3102457 heres what i know about it one it has no name two its made out of shinki but the living weapons call it baiorumetaru three i created it four i own it and five its a vampiric blade it absorbs blood from its victims and apparently it has a monster spirit compared to coatl hellia and now blunt
3102458 a nameless wonder magnificiant now i want to know its name to learn the name of such a marvel would be exciting even if its name is normal or common the thought of such a mystery is perplexing and pleasurable at the same time

3102487 the reason we have taken this step is because we are concerned at the way things are run at rollers the situation is getting out of hand we are always crying after games hence we need an explanation the situation at rollers has nothing to do with the players or coach but the management at our last meeting at ledumang there were some resolutions that were made but nothing has since come out of them maybe rollers is somebodys company hence whatever we say is irrelevant somebody has to come out and tell us what is the state of rollers
3102488 england is aware of the interest but no decision has been taken yet the fa is aware that botswana would like england to have its training camp in this country i understand even the current coach fabio capello is aware of this it will be very good it will assist football development in the country but like we say in england there are many many bridges to cross first england must qualify for the world cup 2010
3102489 i talked to a number of people about progress i believe our relationship as the fa with the bfa has borne fruit over the last 10 years the purpose of the visit is to recognise 10 years of the meridian project at the invitation of the bfa we believe it has worked extremely well we can tell from the way football in botswana is being administered today the bfa is very professional
3102490 faith means being sure of the things we hope for and knowing that something is real even when we do not see it faith is the reason we remember great people who lived in the past

3102492 while the canadian immigration system separates residency from work permits the u s bundles the two together the u s immigration act which contains about 75 visa categories needs to be overhauled
3102493 right now what we want to do is knock down what i see as some unnecessarily burdensome regulations between our countries that tie people up at the border for too long

3102499 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3102500 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3102501 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3102502 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3102503 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3102504 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3102505 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3102506 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3102507 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3102508 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3102509 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3102510 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3102511 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3102512 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3102513 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3102514 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3102515 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3102516 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3102517 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3102518 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3102519 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3102520 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3102521 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3102522 whats more points awarded seemed to increase after the blue athlete was digitally transformed into a red athlete and decrease when the red competitor changed to blue
3102523 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3102524 oh my god its grotesque oh and theres something in a jar
3102525 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3102526 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3102527 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3102528 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3102529 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3102530 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3102531 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3102532 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3102533 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3102534 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3102535 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3102536 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3102537 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3102538 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3102539 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3102540 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3102541 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3102542 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3102543 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3102544 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3102545 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3102546 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3102547 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3102548 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3102549 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3102550 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3102551 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3102552 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3102553 the purpose of the project is to create an accessible resource for people interested in learning about their genealogy or local genealogy in general
3102554 our project is geared toward things that have peoples names in it

3102563 the genealogical society is purposefully opening its meeting and inviting all citizens
3102564 the information gained at this meeting will guide us in the formation of the library support organization
3102565 the formation of a friends of the library in the near future will help to promote better library funding for all users of the library and expand the present services to meet the interests of children teens parents our golden oldie seniors and all other interests of our varied population
3102566 because of the need for an adequate library to assist with genealogical and family history research local genealogy society members have a special interest in helping the local library to have a larger book and related materials collection
3102567 therefore our group is taking a leadership role in promoting enhanced local support of the library
3102568 it is a generally known fact that printing was discovered in haarlem by our townsman laurens janszoon coster

3102570 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3102571 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3102580 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3102581 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3102582 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3102583 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3102584 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3102585 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3102586 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3102587 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3102588 it was a connection to my past and gave me a much better understanding about what happened to her
3102589 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3102627 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3102628 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3102629 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3102630 the two storied and l shaped house rests on a circular base which is over 44 meters in diameter
3102631 engineer was thinking of the sun s path of a relation with landscape and the space of human s life he ventured to hope that the new construction breakthroughs would free mankind from the heaviness of traditional techniques and from the burden of history
3102632 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3102633 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3102634 in a survey of business leaders the iod found that nearly half its members thought the quality of school education has declined and the literacy and numeracy skills of young people has fallen over the past ten years
3102635 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3102636 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3102651 esa cruz es de amor y la encontramos d a a d a en lugar de hacer las cosas por quedar bien o por evitar una discusi n hag moslas por amor a cristo y por eso que buena costumbre es tener un crucifijo siempre a la mano en nuestra habitaci n y acordarnos que desde esa cruz el se or nos ama nos llama nos consuela y nos anima

3102730 it certainly is prior restraint on the part of government but my guess is its the kind of prior restraint that would be upheld on every level of court because it involves real damage to other people
3102731 prior restraint by the government is a very arduous system to prove the supreme court has said that any system of prior restraint is presumed to be unconstitutional so the government has a heavy burden of proof to try to justify the system

3102736 just to put into context for you how big i think it is for us and for the business as a whole i think to date there have been two great revolutions in movies when we went to silent films to talkies and the second is when we went from black and white to color i actually think this is as big and i think it will be as prevalent and as impactful in some short period of time meaning while were all still around movies will be in 3 d not some movies movie theater experience will be a 3 d experience
3102737 what is it about it today that is different from where weve been in the past are a couple of things one it was never about the art it was a gimmick the glasses changed pretty dramatically and even working with the largest eyeglass company in the world on basically what would be transitionally lenses your sunglasses will be your movie glasses in the short order here you think about it if youre going to go outside you need sunglasses if youre going to play tennis youre going to have a tennis racquet if youre going to go to the beach youre going to have a bathing suit if youre going to the movie youve got glasses so its a cultural change but one i think one will happen very quickly obviously the kids will adapt in masses in short order people will have their own glasses

3102798 but once its all said and done retailers are not necessarily losing business from it the folks buying the 5 000 or 10 000 suits or 1 000 shoes arent as affected by whats going on in the world

3102801 our nation typically uses only about five percent of one of our most precious resources unlike other natural resources there is no benefit to allowing this spectrum to lie fallow the airwaves can provide huge economic and social gains if used more efficiently as seen today with the relatively tiny slices utilized by mobile phones and wifi services

3102807 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
3102808 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
3102809 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
3102810 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mindset
3102811 in 2004 i won the gold medal for myself today i won it for all my supporters and fans

3102821 i feel like we have moved light years in terms of looking at individual students
3102822 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3102823 we were really not on the radar screen of any major consumer electronics manufacturers previously
3102824 they did not see blockbuster as a potential retailer of these devices with the announcement of the circuit city transaction publicly it caught the attention of all the consumer electronics providers
3102825 i dont have a device to play my stuff on so i wont build it
3102826 the truth is our leaders want a contract not to call a strike
3102827 the fact they union members did authorize one doesnt make it any more likely

3102829 i think everyone is quite sad that the gallery will be closing
3102830 there are a number of wonderful artists who have participated and shown their work on a regular basis it will be kind of an artistic blow to the seacoast area
3102831 id say it covers pretty much every art form that you can imagine everything from watercolors of local scenes to oils of beautiful nature it also includes abstract art just about every form of art you can imagine but its all done by seacoast artists
3102832 needless to say we are all very disappointed that the shop cant continue because this gallery was such an incredibly beautiful move for us from our previous location below the water street bookstore that space although less expensive was really off the beaten track this is right on water street has a beautiful storefront window and gets a lot of foot traffic
3102833 its just that people are holding onto their money to pay for staples like food fuel and gasoline so art is not as desirable as it seems these days
3102834 its very unique in todays marketplace to have a piece of original artwork our pieces are reasonably priced and offer a variety of artwork
3102835 we are hoping area residents rally around us for the auction we are going to have to make a sad situation a little better
3102836 the space is so awkward it had a lot of wall space and because it is three floors it doesnt really lend itself to a lot of businesses
3102837 we are really sad to close the place we really loved it
3102838 deputy silver has been working diligently to have hampton acquire this designation from the state of new hampshire and these units play a role in the hopes that this will happen

3102846 the town probably quadruples the amount of waste in the summer
3102847 so its good that i came in at a good time to see it really busy and how much the volume increases in the offseason once things slow down we can look at some of the housekeeping things
3102848 the initial thing is to evaluate the audit and the consultants report
3102849 well look at how we can incorporate some of the things here that have been successful i dont want to make change for the sake of change many things here are working well i want it to be a place where its safe to work and know that were doing the best we can for the town its a work in progress

3102872 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
3102873 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
3102874 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
3102875 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one

3102883 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

3102888 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3102889 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3102890 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes

3102923 n or is it necessary to conclude that handing over the fruits of the interviews in this case to u s officials constituted a breach of mr khadrs s 7 rights
3102924 merely conducting interviews with a canadian citizen held abroad under a violative process may not constitute participation in that process
3102925 s 7 imposes a duty on canada to provide disclosure of materials in its possession arising from its participation in the foreign process that is contrary to international law and jeopardizes the liberty of a canadian citizen

3102951 we are excited to play an integral part in helping adults protect themselves against this serious infection
3102952 if we play like we played this week well beat australia
3102953 this is a very exciting stage but a starting stage
3102954 the key is to turn up to every single test match like we turned up to this one with the structures and the players weve got the type of attack weve had in this game the way weve gone about the game and the way weve been up for it every single day and the emotions that the guys have come out with its not far away from a perfect start its the way we want to play our cricket in the future
3102955 ive been doing a lot of thinking over the last five days and ive definitely done a bit of thinking about australia next year
3102956 certainly a lot more than i would have if i was a player its about getting the structure right for a long amount of time so the players can feel comfortable and know their role and deliver i think thats very important over the next nine months for the boys to learn their roles and deliver next year
3102957 its been a good fun five days and ive got a real happy tiredness
3102958 its about that excitement at the start but i want to be a guy who talks to the players and they think yeah he really truly wants me to do well here its important to have that relationship with your players and your coach where you really want to perform for each other and you know theyll do anything on the planet for you its a recipe for success
3102959 big steve came back in after a time out and he was magnificent
3102960 i said to stevey when i told him he was playing i want you open i want you to bowl fast and straight and bowl like the old steve harmison he said hed do his best and his best was good enough
3102961 hes a huge player absolutely huge and weve seen this week how important he is for us
3102962 im going to be looking after steve as best i can but also looking to get the best out of him as well i think now hes experienced international cricket again which he loves and with the smile hes got now im definitely going to get the best out of him
3102963 it would be lovely to have him coming in first change with the white ball but you dont always get what you want in life

3102970 it certainly is prior restraint on the part of government but my guess is its the kind of prior restraint that would be upheld on every level of court because it involves real damage to other people

3102979 ive had junior soldiers to officers pull me in the hallway or in the dining facility and say hey what do i need to do to vote
3102980 its a simple process but i think one of the biggest challenges that we are going to have here while in theater is just getting the word out
3102981 i think a lot of times people think the process is harder than it is when it really only takes five minutes
3102982 weve signed up about 180 people in the last five weeks
3102983 soldiers are at the core of an organization that protects democracy protects the rights that we believe in

3103008 tailoring pediatric preventive care to individual needs phase 2 validating a new instrument
3103009 those children with more challenging problems could benefit from more frequent visits to their doctor but we dont yet know how to identify those children

3103277 these dismal numbers speak for themselves they are a reflection of his inability to lead his incompetence as a manager and his failure in virtually every category that can be measured we have tried every conceivable way to convince him to invest in and maximize the goodwill of his employees he has failed miserably
3103278 shrinking the airline to achieve profitability has been demonstrated to be a failed business practice

3103287 the implications go beyond their threat to a democratic georgia russia is using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbours such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west
3103288 what is interesting about the us response is that you have the mccain campaign in one corner immediately understanding the significance of russias aggression and in the opposite corner you have the bush administration standing with the obama campaign taking a much more diluted stance
3103289 in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

3103420 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3103421 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3103435 epicuruss philosophy exercised so widespread an influence that for a long time it was touch and go whether christianity might not have to give way before it
3103436 this is the only place in the world where we know for certain that a greco roman library was entombed in a manner that ensured its preservation
3103437 there are almost certainly more books to be found there
3103438 the villa remains one of the great buildings of the ancient world and it should certainly be excavated
3103439 this would be true even if we were to find no further papyri though the likelihood that we will find them adds much to the case the building will certainly contain many other things and is of unique historical interest if we know of a site that should be excavated and we have the capacity let us get on with it of all the sites in the world this one ranks close to the top of the list for potential and historical importance
3103440 we have a big problem with the water if we excavate here after one month we have a metre of water
3103441 they make this cavity this cave it is not soclear and they bring into view only a small part and when they finish we have to manage the cave
3103442 our task is to preserve what is found but it is very difficult to project an entire excavation digging at the villa thats a huge undertaking we would have to change streets demolish houses and change the lives of thousands of people in ercolano and portici it is a problem for the mayors it is a political decision in the true sense of the word
3103443 for me they must open and read all the papyri they have had for centuries before we look for others
3103444 if i want to eat a meal at my home i dont go to the supermarket if i have a full fridge
3103445 parts of the villa where the ancient diggers dont go
3103446 but they are not what can we do about nature
3103447 today i think the method of archeology is not to find treasures
3103448 it is amazing to claim that it is treasure hunting when one asks to have the papyri excavated before vesuvius buries them definitively
3103449 if lava flows over the site again i doubt we will ever have access to them
3103450 as for the publication of all the papyri being demanded before more are excavated might one ask that the whole of pompeii and herculaneum be properly published before anything more there is unearthed it seems to me to be arrogance to deny future generations the opportunity to read more such books just because there are at present very few classical scholars with the competence and the energy to decipher and bring out those that we do have
3103451 there are of course serious issues about conservation and the interface with the modern city which are not to be dismissed lightly
3103452 they are solvable there is huge potential also for an excavation to contribute to the local economy and urban regeneration if agreement could be reached on options
3103453 empty is that philosophers argument by which no human suffering is therapeutically treated

3103460 i spent many many saturday afternoons watching reruns of star trek and dreaming of its worlds leonard nimoy helped inspire my imagination of what mysteries the universe might in fact hold

3103474 i think its easier for us to slide craft in there because hes a little older but he has to prove himself
3103475 osaar and chris forcier will be right in the mix to be able to say no im the best prospect part of that is leadership and part of that is knowing what youre doing theres a lot of moxie that goes into being a quarterback and that doesnt show up on the stat sheet
3103476 being patient and by not going in the tank its a great story of understanding that this may not be your time because the coaches have to make decisions but when your time shows up again instead of wasting time by going in the tank you stayed positive and stayed ready

3103491 the case for maintaining prescription charges is in tatters today
3103492 i presented the bill to abolish prescription charges in scotland to the holyrood parliament in 2003 because i believe they are in effect a tax on the sick prescription charges are in my mind an affront to the founders of the nhs who made a profound and noble promise in 1947 to provide the best medical care possible to everyone regardless of their means or status the fact that charges were later introduced as a short term emergency measure in 1951 initially by a labour government keen to raise money to fight a war in korea is unfortunate to say the least now there are nearly a million people in britain who regularly go without the medicines prescribed for them by their doctors because they simply cannot afford the charge of 7 per item the case for maintaining prescription charges is in tatters today they simply cannot be justified on medical grounds on financial grounds or on the basis of any logic when you look at those who are exempt and those who must pay then all sense goes out the window the richest people in britain often get their medicines free like jk rowling entitled to free prescriptions as a new mum or the queen entitled as a senior citizen whilst on the other hand millions of the poorest patients must pay a small fortune for theirs some chronically sick patients often have to finds the money for a cocktail of tablets again and again and again the welsh parliament led the way by abolishing these infamous charges in 2006 the new snp government up here have accepted my case for abolition and promised to do so by 2011 we will keep them to that promise so i welcome swindon tucs efforts to ensure that millions of patients in england benefit too i pledge to do all i can to help you in your campaign for health justice

3103501 it is no secret that there are israeli military advisors in georgia but israel has a delicate relationship with russia that it doesnt want to upset that is presumably why israel froze defense sales to georgia on tuesday israel is clearly far more beholden to the us than to russia but i suspect the bush administration would rather israel stayed out of any explicit involvement so unless i drastically underestimate the georgian military i cant see any other outcome than a decisive russian victory here
3103502 but complexity is no excuse for abdicating moral judgement in situations of this importance if resonsibility for the conflict is not a black and white matter the picture is not uniformly grey either by any reasonable measure the impact of russian policy has been uniquely destructive in generating political divisions in the caucuses whatever his faults saakashvili is no milosevic and wild russian allegations of genocide have no independent support

3103518 the rapid subscriber growth that ev do rev a has brought to lg telecom is a testimony to the consumer appeal of affordable broadband data services
3103519 given the proven results we have seen from 41 other cdma2000 operators around the globe who have deployed rev a technology we can assume that this incredible growth rate will continue and further increase lg telecoms data revenues
3103520 weve been tremendously pleased with the response to our oz data service introduction
3103521 with oz weve given consumers a new open internet world for mobile phones at an affordable flat rate price we will continue to exceed the expectations of our customers with new service offerings that deliver enhancements and greater value
3103522 i think its safe to assume that some of these calls and puts are being traded together
3103523 todays price action took many by surprise i think there is some difference of opinion as to whether it will be sustained through the rest of the contract
3103524 we have to challenge ourselves to be relevant to trend setting customers were looking at ways to enhance and refresh our products

3103540 i dont know that bitter is the term anytime you try to do something and it doesnt work out its disappointing

3103546 these shocking and startling figures mean that every council tax payer in staffordshire is paying nearly 30 per head towards funding this very worrying level of absence

3103548 the cost of sickness absence quoted by the opposition is way off the mark due to crude and basic calculations

3103555 its very clear that green energy is now front and center in the minds of the business sector

3103566 i saw a bumper sticker that said war isnt the answer i thought to myself its the solution as conservative black folks we dont fight like we should we look at those on top complain just as much as the ones on the bottom and were stuck in the middle trying to navigate through hate bias intolerance and a constant need to explain we are not all alike so i make my declaration of war on our so called black leaders your services are no longer needed we have a duty to wipe out mass ignorance and not help support it by supporting you i will say it one more time how in the hell did you make it and why in the hell do you then turn around and tell me i cant and ill even answer it for you you need me to broke and ignorant so you can succeed aint gonna happen your final check is in the mail on the ftws of our race f k you too you get no more sympathy from me if you think you have the right to sell drugs rob steal beat rape or harass and still be safe in our neighborhoods you are wrong you are a product of your environment no you are a product of choice you could choose to suffer a little now go to school maybe get picked on a little for not having the best clothes or not get any play from the girls but you choose to want it now and f k the world not working anymore
3103567 on the ignorant for the sake of being ignorant of our race whats up once black people risked their lives trying to learn to read and now you risk yours trying to stay away from a book o k i had to pause right there this should have been my first declaration why do we set a goal to be stupid on black women having babies to keep a man you know he aint no good my sistas i know we dont always get along but you deserve so much more and on top of that you make our men weak i dont want to hear you complain about n s being dogs when you let them dog you on black men having babies and not taking care of them you know you wrong if your dad wasnt there and you choose not to be there that doesnt make any sense at all to me what excuse could your father tell you that would release all the pain inside you would you accept my boys all got daytons so i had to rob that fool so i could have so too
3103568 could you imagine if we win if each one of us takes a little step and we actually push our people past drugs aids poverty defeatist thinking misogyny materialism violence and negativity that keeps us poor and oppressed imagine schools that pay for books not metal detectors imagine communities that pay for playgrounds instead of jails imagine stores opening in black neighborhoods where white people arent scared to go

3103576 you got to go you got to go hes coming
3103577 it was the opportunity to play strategy and i give the total credit to tim cindric
3103578 this is one of the first races where we didnt have the car but we took chances
3103579 we have got to start capitalizing on these cars that can win these races
3103580 dixon had a bit of speed on us but i think we had a better car in traffic it was between him and i to win this race and i think it is just unfortunate
3103581 i think the question of pressure has been answered i dont think that bothers him i think he feeds on it and uses it to his advantage
3103582 i dont think hes one of those guys that pressure really affects hes so motivated to win i dont even know if he even feels pressure its hard for anything to affect you when youre having a season like this
3103583 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
3103584 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
3103585 i never could get the runs in the right spots

3103596 appears to have been ahead of the curve in his assessment that moscow was the bad actor here
3103597 its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks
3103598 certainly their initial responses they were as you say different mr obamas initial response was to say that both should show restraint the invader and the invaded thats not whats going on here

3103605 increase public confidence in the quality of scientific research and consideration on this issue
3103606 if those who were compiling such research were aware of the fact that it was possible that their draft reports or early research would be disclosed in the future this may in fact improve the level of argument or debate contained in the drafts because the authors would know that their initial research may be disclosed at some point and therefore open to public scrutiny
3103607 the commissioner accepts that if this particular draft report was disclosed it is reasonable to argue that authors of such reports in the future may be less willing to be equally candid when compiling similar studies because of concerns that their comments may be placed in the public domain

3103646 there are only certain types of woman in this world that wouldnt agree with my last statement and you know what theyre called
3103647 this is a fifty thousand dollar rock on my finger
3103648 mine was only five thousand but really it doesnt matter right i mean as long as your marrying the man you love
3103649 15 be diligent to present yourself approved to god as a workman who does not need to be ashamed accurately handling the word of truth
3103650 we are not praying for revival anymore we believe that we are in revival
3103651 my dear friends we are in revival at the moment
3103652 and to ask him to bring revival to our beloved southern africa
3103653 the good news is revival is here and we are part of this
3103654 well i want to tell you that you are the revival
3103655 we know once again that we are in revival in south africa
3103656 even as we see things culminating we believe that we are living in the last days i know that we have said that for some time but we can see that all the signs are there now and it is very exciting because the bible says that if christ be for us who can stand against us rom 8 31 2
3103657 i believe that we are in the last days and god is rallying his troops for the last battle
3103658 the lord has prompted me to share his intentions for his men in these last days
3103659 tell us when will these things happen and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age
3103660 in my name saying i am the christ and will mislead many
3103661 you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars
3103662 apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed the son of destruction
3103663 being asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god would come he answered them
3103664 to the law and to the testimony if they do not speak according to this word it is because there is no light in them
3103665 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of satan with all power and signs and false wonders with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved for this reason god will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false
3103666 the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of satan
3103667 so we can clearly see that a sign is not confirmation that it comes from god for satan can make a heart shaped cloud as well
3103668 i was recently sent a photograph taken at the mighty men conference that we held at shalom in april 2007 which shows a white light coming down out of a dark sky descending upon and spreading out over the tent i can only describe it as looking like hot butter melting and spreading over the tent i have not yet personally met bruno the man who took the photograph he comes from phalaborwa a town in the northern part of south africa he wept when he first saw the photograph and he was reluctant to send it to me because he wasnt sure what my reaction would be i choose to believe it was the glory of god over the tent which was full to capacity numbering seven thousand men we had been speaking about the light of god about the glory of gods presence at that time
3103669 however things are getting so critical now that everything else seems to be fading into insignificance when it come to talking about eternal issues things like a mans soul his family his marriage his business and his future not to mention his nation
3103670 i would really encourage you to continue to let your expectation for your life for your family for your country for your vision to come only from god
3103671 it is only the faithful that will overcome rom 1 17 the just righteous will live by faith as we see trouble brewing up in every area politically financially morally we know that we will succeed as the children of promise 5
3103672 we will be staging it open air because we are concerned about the seating capacity in the tabernacle at shalom ministries
3103673 christians understand that their kingdom values should penetrate all spheres of their personal lives their families their businesses their political lives and the rest

3103675 and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie
3103676 power encounters and spiritual mapping techniques followed by exorcising them from the people including christians buildings and even whole cities and nations
3103677 power is released through our tongue every word that comes from my mouth is either a blessing or a curse
3103678 the winds of the holy spirit are coming the winds of the kingdom of god are coming and the winds of change are coming to cities and nations around the world
3103679 this is the day of outpouring this is the day of revival and this is the beginning days of revival and revivals this revival is a fountainhead of revivals is revival that prepares the way for other revivals to follow this revival is a foundation of other revivals that come the day has come that we will go from glory to glory revival to revival and there will never be a moment without revival this is revival of divine healing a revival of signs and wonders this is a revival of anointing and this is a revival of the power of god restoration of signs and wonders has begun the church will be covered with signs and wonders this is a revival of anointing that church will be covered with rivers of the anointing this revival is a restoration of revival what will follow this revival will be holiness and unity holiness will come by grace and of the heart and unity of love and unity of relationship will come
3103680 lord jesus how can we not believe in you how can we doubt that you have caused winds of revival and repentence to blow over the whole of our country
3103681 i was so excited to see close on 100 first time commitments and literally the whole crowd repented before god and made a re commitment to jesus
3103682 this sunday i will be in durban and next week i go to belfast northern ireland to preach to the protestants and the roman catholics and the whosoevers salvations and re commitments and a stirring in the hearts of the irish people
3103683 therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside the weight and the sin which so easily ensnares us and run the race that is set before us
3103684 the god tv channel will be broadcasting the event live to all their viewers throughout the world starting from 2 30pm sa time they tell me that they have access to a viewership of approximately 500 million people amazing
3103685 im also on tv recorded each week here on the farm and then broadcast every week on tbn ctv and the rhema channel
3103686 and they went out and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word through the accompanying signs
3103687 the new message delivered by the apostles was confirmed by these signs once the message was written down the signs ceased to be the confirming agent and
3103688 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of my father who is in heaven will enter
3103689 and then i will declare to them depart from me you who practice lawlessness
3103690 it is written you shall worship the lord your god and serve him only
3103691 who is this man and why does faith like potatoes sound so familiar

3103714 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
3103715 the actions of the georgian leadership in south ossetia are a crime and foremost they are a crime against their own people because a deadly blow has been delivered to the territorial integrity of georgia which brings massive damage to its national identity
3103716 its hard to imagine after all that had happened and after all that is still happening theyll be able to convince south ossetia to be part of georgia
3103717 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people i think it would be correct if you instruct the military prosecutor to document all such incidents
3103718 for centuries russia has played a highly positive stabilizing role in the region being a guarantor of cooperation and progress things have always been and are going to remain that way nobody should have any doubts about this

3103736 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3103737 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3103738 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades

3103743 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3103744 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3103745 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle

3103750 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3103751 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

3103763 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial

3103814 it seems like the smell is getting all the hype these days and i love the smell but that doesnt mean that there arent other awesome all ages spaces in l a
3103815 i can honestly say that id rather play a sean carnage monday night than anywhere else in la
3103816 sean carnage is a believer in the youth and the way they can change the face of music
3103817 congrats to sean carnage for three years of utter greatness what a show on monday hes had some of our favorite bands play his nights over the past few years but truly the best part of a sean carnage evening is the uninhibited girl on boy girl on girl boy on boy boy on pi ata free for all art of dancing so while other clubs on monday are winding down with patrons yawning at the midnight hour pehrspace is still filled with youngsters raving until 2am to 90s dance idols la bouche 2 unlimited and amber like the picture above even the occasional silver lake straight arrow hipster will wander in and feel compelled to grind to those cheesy 90s happy hardcore hits that dj kyle h mabson unleashes they cant help it its the carnage effect

3103846 untruthful manner in which the ministry of education and skills development sought to justify the introduction of school fees
3103847 the school is still counting on the ghana education service ges to furnish and equip the building with all the necessary logistics
3103848 what is more pathetic is that since last year the school has not received any financial support from the university which it serves as a practical school to ucc because funds received by the university were not enough to complete the universitys own projects
3103849 it was only the pta which donated a 23 seater bus to the school 13 years ago which is presently nothing to write home about

3103922 that race is why we get into the business of sports broadcasting
3103923 it was certainly the greatest olympic relay race i have ever seen
3103924 without a doubt its the great olympic moment ive ever experienced or called head and shoulder above anything and we have done some pretty good things
3103925 it was something out of a hollywood script it had everything it had the guys that did the trash talking in the french it had the 32 year old swimmer in jason lezak who has not had successful olympic swims in the past trying to catch the world record holder in the 100m and doing it when it looked like he had no chance at all it was a crazy crazy moment i know rowdy in his eyes agrees with me that it was simply the greatest olympic relay race he has ever seen
3103926 dan will be able to tell you that he now has called two of the greatest athletes if not the two greatest athletes in history and he got to do it in the same year with tiger at the u s open and michael on his way to potentially making olympic history it was an honor to call that race
3103927 it was certainly the greatest olympic relay race i have ever seen i have been trying to think about another race that i got more excited about and i cant think of one
3103928 he is right there with tiger woods i called michael phelps tiger woods in a speedo the other night there are just so many uncanny ways that phelps reminds me of tiger its just scary they just remind me of each other so much if tiger is over a putt and he has to make it i watched him at the u s open and he made it when phelps needs to have some sort of magical touch to win a gold medal and get it done he does the same thing it is really kind of eerie how much those two guys remind me of each other
3103929 i sensed it a little bit at the first 50m only because he alain bernard was out so fast and ive seen americans do the same thing dan and i remember in sydney when they all over swam that first 50m and thats how the australians ended up beating them the same sort of thing happened to bernard on that first 50m he was out in 21 2 seconds well the world record is 21 2 he was out way too fast at about the 75m he started tightening up but i still didnt think there was any room for lezak to catch him because he was just so far ahead but you could really start to feel it at about 90 meters
3103930 it doesnt take much for me to get excited i get excited about world records and fast swimming but certainly just because of the drama behind the race it made it more exciting
3103931 that race is why we get into the business of sports broadcasting it was just absolute excitement shock and the utmost of wattage it was just so unexpected it was so clear that bernard was going to win this race and in those last meters it was like a switch was flipped and all of a sudden lezak pulled it out i think it has been clear throughout the games that we are certainly not rooting for the americans the excitement that we had was just simply about an unbelievable piece of drama in the pool
3103932 the lead that this guy bernard had hes the world record holder in the 100m was certainly in my mind insurmountable it was just that much of a long shot i just let my natural emotions take over that there was just no way that lezak was going to pull it out thats what made it so unbelievable at the end i think thats what added to the race the race that will now go down in lore and olympic history just because it looked insurmountable but the so called impossible happened
3103933 when you have both relays breaking the world record by four seconds that just shows you what kind of field it was that is just totally unheard of the world record up until that point had been broken by tenths or hundredths of a second now all of a sudden in one fell swoop it was four seconds
3103934 frankly i would say i am happy happy that we are halfway on our journey into another phase of our lives happy that we belong to each other now i also feel that we grow much more attached
3103935 these are remarkably large figures particularly for ministers in a government that has produced so much rhetoric about public sector pay restraint
3103936 next time these ministers say they understand what ordinary people are going through everyone should remember they have protected themselves from the soaring cost of living while the rest of us foot the bill
3103937 these figures show that by voting against our proposals to make mps pay more transparent government ministers pocketed thousands of pounds of taxpayers money
3103938 how are we supposed to restore public faith in politicians when it is labour government ministers themselves who are denying the public the proper scrutiny system they deserve

3103968 denim has become so high priced as of late my friends back home dont want to spend 250 for a pair of jeans i want them to be able to walk into a medium priced store and be able to afford a cool pair of jeans for less than 100 bucks
3103969 especially with the euro being so strong and the u s dollar being so weak i think a lot of younger people who had initially avoided them are staying there because they are hearing so many great things about them and money is tight
3103970 its not only youth filling up the hostel anymore like in the 70s
3103971 are more expensive but also provide more privacy and luxury
3103972 they can be surprisingly expensive for the quality so i suppose the image of the cheap backpackers hostel is rapidly disappearing
3103973 they talk about the price but it doesnt prevent them from coming here and traveling
3103974 we chose hostels because i think we wanted a more authentic backpacking experience

3104035 this measure will set a marketing code of conduct to help ensure health care providers make choices about prescription drugs and medical devices for their patients based on therapeutic benefits and cost effectiveness
3104036 i am confident the department of public health pursuant to its regulatory authority will safeguard the confidentiality of companies trade secrets and proprietary information and protect against roadblocks to medical research or the education of health care providers
3104037 this legislation lays a firm foundation for the serious kind of cost containment that is necessary if we are to realize the goals of health reform and i look forward to a continued partnership with the administration as we implement the law
3104038 this facility will serve our patrons for many years to come

3104080 in my riding it saddens me to say that our representative ken boshcoff has done his share of eroding the public trust and
3104081 his writings about dions carbon tax plan fort frances times july 16 2008 and radio interviews find them here on netnewsledger
3104082 ndp leader jack layton should repay canadian taxpayers for the estimated 50 000 cost of printing and mailing election style brochures misrepresenting the work ethic and commitment of thunder bay rainy river member of parliament ken boshcoff
3104083 this is a dishonest attack on my efforts in parliament
3104084 canadian taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for ndp election propaganda
3104085 jack layton seems to have no problem billing the canadian taxpayers for john raffertys election materials
3104086 in 2008 alone i was pleased by the all party support i received for the passage of m 183 canadian content levels for public transit which will protect local jobs and on the strong influence i have had on important issues like food labelling standards and the forestry sector report
3104087 to claim that i have been voting with mr harper is false and is a lie to my constituents about the priorities of their political leadership
3104088 its bad enough that jack layton is misrepresenting my voting record whats even worse is that he is billing the canadian taxpayers for the printing and mailing of these articles which contribute nothing honest or positive to a discussion of the important issues facing our region
3104089 i am not crying because of the money but i am crying because allah let me urinate for 70 years and he never sent me a bill
3104090 o lord how can i ever duly thank you when my thanking you is also a favor from you to me
3104091 ibm research initiatives to bring cloud computing to the enterprise
3104092 iab is committed to promoting the interactive advertising industrys public policy agenda and its important that we maintain a strong presence in washington d c
3104093 this is particularly true at a time when the online advertising industrys successful efforts to self regulate are being challenged by ill informed and ill advised regulatory proposals that would severely curtail the ability of businesses to market effectively on the internet
3104094 she has extensive experience lobbying at both the state and federal levels she is a skilled attorney who brings a deep practical background from within the industry to iab
3104095 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss
3104096 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date so i said i dont follow the rules ooooh it was so good
3104097 guest walks up to the bar theyre going to ask what that is and in light of the dnc its the obama granite martini

3104101 not even on the high holiest of jewish holidays do we all get together
3104102 it would appear that we had a bohemian rock n roll upbringing
3104103 and in many ways it was but our mother was superstrict and we also had the very english proper nanny
3104104 she always loved music and books and had a tremendous curiosity and intensity whatever subject caught her imagination
3104105 i stay away from the tabloids i dont feel that i should personally have to defend myself to a magazine that im not a drug addict i dont do drugs i dont sell pictures of my friends
3104106 im not going to talk about lindsay because shes my friend you know shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
3104107 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
3104108 the funniest thing was i bought a bunch of those tabloid magazines and didnt even notice that samantha was on the cover of one
3104109 i love the ronsons theyre close to my and i respect all the work they do samantha and my relationship is a private matter
3104110 they gave me an insight into multi sport events the distractions i need to be aware of but also of enjoying seeing the efforts and commitment of other athletes in other sports
3104111 i learnt when i need to get my head down in order to prepare myself without the help of people like your friends who arent there you learn when you need to be serious
3104112 alex took part in the world junior champs in beijing so i got some of his experiences of what the weather will be like and how to acclimatise

3104119 i think after his ethnic look in jodhaa akbar this look will be also be remembered by all his fans his look will be european and will be seen mostly wearing hats
3104120 bhansali has been in talks with hrithik for three four years for various projects but hrithik is very particular when it comes to matters professional after saawariya bhansali and hrithik have been in talks hrithik even went to the directors house for meetings and just when everything seemed set he backed out

3104123 the exhibition traced cleopatras life as queen of egypt and her liaisons with the two great roman leaders of the day julius caesar and mark antony
3104124 pharaoh ptolemy xii died in march 51 bc making the 18 year old cleopatra and her 12 year old brother ptolemy xiii joint monarchs these first three years of their reign was difficult due to economic difficulties famine deficient floods of nile and political conflicts
3104125 cleopatra was descended from a line of rulers that began with ptolemy i a general who served under alexander the great in the 4th century bce
3104126 because of this attention to education cleopatra studied philosophy literature art music medicine and was able to speak six different languages these languages were aramaic egyptian ethiopic greek hebrew and latin

3104129 the name marks the claim a man stakes in the world the name is a mans watermark above which the tides can never rise it is a strange freedom to be adrift in the world of men to go nameless
3104130 you know youre being taken seriously when karl rove takes a shot at you
3104131 will all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years
3104132 hes been able but undistinguished i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done
3104133 kaine was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
3104134 and again with all due respect to richmond virginia its smaller than chula vista california aurora colorado mesa or gilbert arizona north las vegas or henderson nevada its not a big town
3104135 im not running for anything so im not going to make a case
3104136 my sense is it shows somebody who doesnt know anything about virginia
3104137 theyre tired of a federal government that cant respond to a hurricane like katrina cant figure out what the rationale to go to war is cant manage a war people care about management so rove either doesnt know about virginia or he doesnt care about management
3104138 wont that bolster john mccains argument that the presidency needs someone with experience dealing with issues like these
3104139 i think the two concerns that americans have are the state of our economy and our security at home and abroad
3104140 and this issue in georgia obviously raises great questions but i think as we look at security what americans want is judgment experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment
3104141 it was funny but wearing a clown suit and juggling would be funny too
3104142 but it doesnt connect with the concerns americans have about gas prices about the war about the economy i hope the mccain camp does more of those ads
3104143 hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia
3104144 virginia is preparing to send letters to about 400 felons convicted in the 1970s and 1980s notifying them that genetic evidence in their cases has been reviewed including eight cases in which defendants dna did not match crime samples
3104145 we may as well just throw all these letters up into the wind
3104146 i dont think theres any doubt in anyones mind that we have a moral and statutory duty to notify people that evidence exists that could prove their innocence
3104147 by choosing to use the mail we are selecting the least reliable method of notification
3104148 i think it will work in many many of the cases in those cases where it doesnt work then we can explore another option
3104149 science has advanced and now there is other information available so lets let them know about it
3104150 a surge in hispanic immigration over the past decade has dramatically altered the racial and ethnic composition of the regions youngest residents according to u s census bureau figures released today
3104151 all of this really reinforces the importance for counties to increase their investment in early childhood development now
3104152 even more worrisome is that over half of the english as a second language learners in high school were native born
3104153 the bubbling up of minorities that were now seeing at the younger ages will continue to move up through the age range through the teenage years the working age years and then the housing buying years
3104154 the child population is really a microcosm of the future
3104155 you cannot necessarily predict that just because theyll become majority minority all these schools will become low income
3104156 the washington area has one of the most diverse foreign populations in the nation
3104157 martinsville novelist john grishams campaign appearance with democrat tom perriello seemed like a natural fit
3104158 theres no way you can defend in particular john edwards lack of honesty with the american public
3104159 i am going to suggest that if the democrats want to continue their fundraising dinner with senator john edwards as the keynote the dinner should be renamed the sex lies and dirty money dinner i dont think that any political party should embrace and endorse the morally bankrupt ideals of lies deceit and extramarital affairs
3104160 the true secret of happines lies in taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life
3104161 have nothng in your house that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful
3104162 government officials asserted yesterday that a troubled bioweapons scientist acted alone to perpetrate a terrorism scheme that killed five people a case that centered on a near perfect match of anthrax spores in his custody and a record of his late night laboratory work just before the toxic letters were mailed
3104163 an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence all contorted to create the illusion of guilt
3104164 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
3104165 bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
3104166 we have no idea what his motives may have been and are not going to speculate
3104167 the program will come to a halt thats bad for everyone concerned including us
3104168 of course i dont talk about how i really feel with them it would just make them worse seeing how differently i reacted than they did to the recent events makes me really think about myself a lot i just heard tonight that bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas redacted
3104169 osama bin laden has just decreed death to all jews and all americans
3104170 similar to the test of the anthrax letters postmarked two weeks later warning death to america death to israel
3104171 it is quite possible that dr ivins retained some kind of souvenir or references to the mailing events
3104172 but anywhere apples grow hops grow and weve got some pretty good organic apples around here
3104173 you try to breed a plant that isnt too tall and has multiple arms and few leaves so that its easier to harvest
3104174 weve been serious about this for about a year this is our second crop and already weve found some gems
3104175 you know what else everybody likes parfaits have you ever met a person you say lets get some parfait they say hell no i dont like no parfait parfaits are delicious

3104178 barack obama released a television advertisement yesterday that questions john mccains claims to be a
3104179 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
3104180 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
3104181 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
3104182 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3104183 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
3104184 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
3104185 there needs to be a negative mccain track beyond the bush policy stuff one of the great strengths of the obama campaign has been to not listen to the d c chattering class they have a plan and they stick to it but clearly the d c chattering class are all wringing their hands
3104186 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
3104187 there are no independent groups everybodys walked off the field
3104188 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3104189 ive been swimming and biking so i feel like ive maintained my cardio
3104190 they are attributing it back to maybe a helmet to helmet hit that happened saturday
3104191 whether it is a concussion or a bell ringer or how you tell the difference im not certain
3104192 from this point one week into camp i think ah you has a slight edge on doman its slight
3104193 you could basically list them as even but if we went today it would have been bauman and ah you
3104194 the type of scrimmage it was matched what wagners skill set is
3104195 there are three positions we need to target where we could have performed better
3104196 the ham string bled out which means it came to the surface on saturday so we were able to get most of that discoloration out of there he is running and i thought doing better today it is still going to take some time but at least that was a positive landmark in knowing kind of where it was now that that is out of the way it should progress quicker but i still cant tell you how fast
3104197 when our employees become proficient in english and assimilate into our society it benefits the company the community and the individual everyone gains
3104198 without private security firms it would be impossible to achieve what were achieving here
3104199 as an example they secure some of our bases canadian troops couldnt do their job without the help of private security firms thompson said
3104200 nobody wants to be in a sinking ship they want to be on the right side at this crucial moment
3104201 there is no question that georgia started this conflict with an offensive against the separatists of south ossetia because its entry to nato required a resolution to the problem but the disproportiate and continuing military attacks by russia appears to have united the european union and the u s in a call for the removal of russian troops
3104202 the fighting has now created a major refugee crisis that is spilling over to regional states
3104203 and a political crisis with fears that russia is trying to overthrow the democratically elected pro western government of georgia
3104204 much of the family was already at the nancy creek cemetery there were ten headstones that were only symbolic at the goodwin cemetery the remains were already at nancy creek and we just united the headstones with them
3104205 were hopeful that whoever buys the property will want to include the house in whatever they do
3104206 we are talking to several people who have expressed an interest in moving the house to their property
3104207 because of his dimension this role is perfect for luda
3104208 another great thing is that he and larenz tate menace to society have worked together before
3104209 eve carson was a real hottie were attempting to present her as an academically inclined daisy duke
3104210 the north koreans know what they have to do in putting together that regime
3104211 the north koreans know exactly what it is that we require
3104212 our policy is basically action for action and we need to see that verification regime and thats what we wait for
3104213 russia has applied unprecedented military power and it is of such amplitude that it would have scared much bigger states
3104214 this war has changed the whole system of values of pro western liberal minded people i dont want to be a bad prophet but why would russia stop here there are other countries where russia thinks it has a claim to territory
3104215 very many military servicemen were killed probably in the hundreds
3104216 the longer the course is the more it works in my favor and we rode it yesterday and i liked it the first 7k was really hard and then there was a section that was really fast you could find a really nice rhythm and then of course the big hill after the turnaround but i knew the last 5 to 7k would be gradual uphill and you just had to wait save a little bit in the tank because that was really gonna hurt
3104217 i didnt even think i was going to make it here in time for the race
3104218 tina is a stud she is so fast and such a great person on and off the bike its an honor to race against a rider like her a bigger honor to take that top podium step away
3104219 i knew i always had the power and a big engine it was just a matter of learning how to get in the right position to show that

3104233 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3104234 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3104235 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3104236 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3104237 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3104238 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3104239 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3104240 until now all that we have had from the international community is humanitarian aid which is starting to arrive and statements
3104241 of course this is important but we need much more
3104242 the majority of georgia amp squo s territory is occupied

3104245 the prime minister was freed this afternoon along with three other government officials i understand that only the president is still being held
3104246 the six representatives firmly condemned the coup and said it was unacceptable to overthrow a democratically elected president and demanded that the president and his prime minister are set free and constitutional order is restored
3104247 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3104248 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3104249 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3104250 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication

3104289 were going to use a number of running backs and the starter as far as im concerned will be the guy that plays the first play of the game
3104290 it wont be because one guy has earned the privilege to start over another it will be based on what we decide to do as an offensive staff to start the game theyre going to play obviously were going to have two players and as it looks right now its going to be lendale and chris were going to interchange them throughout the game and then back them up with the other guys
3104291 if you read this space you knew this was coming
3104292 but even now that the odd couple alliance between ralph reed and john mccain is complete you still cant believe that its true
3104293 in alaska and texas they have to drill for it in oregon it falls from the sky
3104294 the columbia river represents a renewable resource that has the potential to keep taxes low and give our children a world class education
3104295 every day millions of gallons of water pour into the ocean that could be sold to other states that desperately need our abundant water supply the state revenue generated from utilizing this wasted resource could be used to lower oregons class sizes improve pay for teachers and create more opportunity at oregons community colleges and universities
3104296 this is a resource we cant afford to waste for the sake of oregons schools and universities
3104297 this is a chance to change the way we pay for government within current state law we can protect salmon and tribal values while creating a plentiful supply of water for oregonians and others who need it for oregon families that means more jobs a more stable economy and more resources for classrooms
3104298 there is a broad view by the public that our health care system needs a full overhaul either to be totally rebuilt or reformed
3104299 often paperwork doesnt arrive or your records arent available when you show up there are also concerns about getting timely access to care
3104300 also having a regular doctor who is available to see you getting timely referrals and having more affordable care are important to people
3104301 if adopted in the final constitution by the people ecuador would become the first country in the world to codify a new system of environmental protection based on rights
3104302 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
3104303 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
3104304 so even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk so i think bob watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees

3104309 a big lie is still a lie tell the truth
3104310 let the press do its job even when that might sting
3104311 i would submit that a president who is unable to learn from his or her own mistakes and then to articulate for a curious public what he or she has learned is not prepared for that office
3104312 banished himself to the ignominious position of worst united states president ever

3104314 an early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
3104315 however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience if the department issues a regulation it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
3104316 until the regulation removes the re definition of abortion and it clearly states that it deals solely with abortion and not with any other procedure nor with any refusals based on the nature of the patient such as single or gay i would not be satisfied
3104317 so after yesterdays disappointing performance what are your thoughts for today

3104344 we have information that a group of men from manchester were in the club at the time and may have spoken to damian gordon we would particularly like to speak to them
3104345 there were a lot of people in club icon when the shooting happened and i want them to come forward and speak to us
3104346 you may have information that you dont realise is important to this inquiry we want to speak to everyone who was at club icon that night we are in the middle of tracing those who were at the club using cctv from the area but it would easier if you could come to us
3104347 i understand that you may be scared to come forward if you saw or know something about what happened to damian but remember this was a young man with a wife and child and his life ahead of him
3104348 damians death has destroyed his family and those responsible need to be stopped and brought to justice there is new legislation in place protecting the anonymity of witnesses this is something we intend to fully investigate for anyone coming forward with information about this crime
3104349 finally i would also appeal to a woman who called us anonymously who we believe to be from the manchester area to contact us again
3104350 the information she provided is very specific and vital and we need to speak to her further any information could be crucial and will be treated in the strictest confidence
3104351 we are making progress its just a matter of time when you move toward a clear and sensible goal things have a tendency to get achieved the market for winning colours stain remover amongst north americas 110 million households and businesses can easily support the target volume of 1 800 000 bottles per year in my opinion this is achievable our objective is that winning colours stain remover develops the reputation of being north americas favourite stain removing product thats what we are working toward for this brand
3104352 its great there are moments of truth that become amazing and fun for example i might be speaking with the owner of a hardware store when by coincidence an employee gets paint all over their pants at the mixing counter that we can clean up on the spot there are too many of these great moments for winning colours growing popularity to be a fluke its a pattern thats what we are developing

3104355 its particularly a moment where john mccain can claim to have been prescient
3104356 appears to have been ahead of the curve in his assessment that moscow was the bad actor here
3104357 its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks
3104358 certainly their initial responses they were as you say different mr obamas initial response was to say that both should show restraint the invader and the invaded thats not whats going on here

3104370 i need to work on my conditioning for games because having been out for so long it will take time before i come back into shape
3104371 it is the aspect i need to improve in and then i am confident the goals will come
3104372 there is a lot of expectation on me here and i feel if i am fully fit i am capable of meeting them but i wont set myself a goal target yet all i want now is to get back in the best shape physically and recover fully from the long lay off
3104373 if we sign a few more players we will be a better and stronger team we will have no choice but to try to finish higher and i feel we can do that
3104374 one of the main reasons they the top four able to get them the better players is money what they can spend in transfer fees and in wages they have the biggest squads you need this to compete successfully in four competitions that is something the other clubs currently dont have
3104375 we already have great players in the squad david james sol campbell peter crouch all internationals but we would always welcome more anything to make the squad stronger

3104560 la verdad es que cuando ves al resto de equipos hacerlo sientes una envidia sana lo m s importante ahora es pensar que tenemos dos partidos por delante que debemos superar y aprovechar la oportunidad que se nos presenta porque si no lo hacemos ahora no sabemos cu ndo se nos puede volver a presentar el grupo sabe que ya no hay marcha atr s
3104561 llevamos esperando este momento hace cuatro a os todos estamos muy ilusionados hay nuevos fichajes que han venido a ayudar y a reforzar al equipo este a o se repite algo que ya exist a la temporada pasada y es que la plantilla est muy comprometida

3104644 well made riesling from australias clare valley is one of the worlds most versatile food friendly wines and this is certainly a well made rendition based on vivid fruit with green apple and lime notes it is dry but very expressive in aroma and flavor zesty acidity lifts and freshens the fruit and greatly prolongs the finish making this a great warm weather sipper but also a promising partner for a very wide range of foods
3104645 this wine typifies riesling from the clare valley it is pale yellow with green hues and the aroma displays lime and lemon characters combined with floral undertones on the palate the crisp acidity for which clare is renowned shines and frames the clean vibrant fruit flavours to their best this wine will age gracefully over coming years enjoy with grilled octopus antipasto or tapas
3104646 is it painful for you to watch your child struggle to learn to talk
3104647 i know for a fact that lauras approach really does work because ive been using it for years myself dont be afraid to copy exactly what she says how and when she says it it is not hard and can become second nature to you just as it has to me by implementing her approach you will set the stage for both you and your child to be successful
3104648 i do think the video will be very helpful for parents with late talkers the ideas are great and you really do show them how to do the things you are talking about which is very important
3104649 find out what your speech therapist hasnt told you or might not know herself
3104650 even when weekly therapy reports indicated a great deal of progress we werent always seeing that progress at home the teach me to talk dvd has dramatically changed the number of words we hear seeing the techniques you use and seeing how easy they are to incorporate in to our daily routines has been a blessing i can get so many words and even phrases out of my both my toddlers by incorporating playfulness in to our daily activities as a working mom ive always felt as if im not as active in my childrens therapy as i should be you dvd is finally helping me make that connection thank you so much for such a fantastic tool
3104651 the dvd brought tears to my eyes not your goal im sure but there you go each strategy you used reminded me of my child it is amazing how simple techniques most of which we take for granted can help a non verbal child become verbal another thing i learned from my experience with being a mom a pediatrician having your guidance and the dvd is that language talking speech and articulation involve so many other aspects of development
3104652 the dvd was quite different from what i expected in a good way i hardly expected to see so much one on one with the kids and it was great
3104653 the dvd is great i wish i had had this when we first started down the path with gabe who has been diagnosed with apraxia
3104654 s eeing these tips in action was very beneficial when you have a child that is language delayed you want to do as much at home as you can after all our children are at home most of all and this dvd helped me do that
3104655 i have worked with quite a few speech therapists in my practice as a developmental interventionist in ten years ive only worked with one that was universally appreciated by parents and young children alike thanks to this dvd you no longer have to live in our county to benefit from laura mizes unique and effective approach for a minimal investment she comes live to your living room to demonstrate her highly successful approach to speech and language therapy
3104656 a lot of the therapy techniques that you use some and or all of his therapists have used except for a few things first your enthusiasm its awesome i have never seen any of my sons therapists be so upbeat and fun as you were in your video i wish they had been because i know my son would respond so well to that in therapy any time i play with him at home and do some of the things you do with your kids like tickling them and just being silly his whole frame of mind changes and i can usually get him to try whatever it is again at least one more time
3104657 get the speech therapy dvd recommended for both parents and professionals
3104658 i think this dvd is a tremendous amp invaluable guidance tool for parents preschool teachers caregivers and other therapists speech occupational developmental etc and should be used as an accessory aid for anyone involved in early childhood development
3104659 teach me to talk is an easy to watch dvd that empowers parents and caregivers with the
3104660 i just finished your dvd it was great i really got into it and actually found myself taking notes as a psc early intervention service coordinator it was helpful to see the speech therapy in motion so i can answer some questions from parents as an ot is was refreshing to see some ot techniques embedded into the speech therapy activities
3104661 thank you so much for allowing me to preview your dvd i will put these techniques into practice myself on monday morning with my clients theyre not going to recognize me anymore i learned so much from watching you provide therapy and i will never use those same approaches again this dvd has rekindled my excitement for pediatric speech therapy i cant wait for next week to come so i can try them out one more thing why didnt they teach me this in grad school thanks again
3104662 what i especially loved was that it wasnt just clips of the perfect session you showed us what to do when a kid turned away or lost interest or was more difficult to engage for instance touching the child or changing their position lets face it sometimes kids have their own agenda
3104663 just watching how my son interacted with the dvd made me a believer in how engaged he will become once it stops being
3104664 t he whole idea of using food during speech is awesome i will usually reward him with something after therapy especially if his self esteem is a little low that day or hes just having an off day but i never thought of buying something to use when working with him nor have any of his therapists used food
3104665 if you are the parent of a young child who has been in speech therapy you may have already learned the hard way that children dont necessarily respond to all speech therapists efforts to
3104666 i love the part about not ruining the interaction and to keep it going with humor this is so important i cant tell you how many times i probably lost gabe in the process of working with him because it was too drill like the withholding concept is explained perfectly it was never explained to me as well as you did i failed to keep it playful and as a result totally killed the communication with gabe as you say in the dvd you will miss the effectiveness and the child wont learn anything i plan on trying to keep things much more playful with him from now on when it comes to with holding

3104674 we felt that limiting the survey to just one group wasnt going to give us the whole picture
3104675 these results showed us that enterprise risk management has become a huge challenge for those charged with managing a companys financial health with many looking for guidance on the next steps they should take

3104704 we are making progress its just a matter of time when you move toward a clear and sensible goal things have a tendency to get achieved the market for winning colours stain remover amongst north americas 110 million households and businesses can easily support the target volume of 1 800 000 bottles per year in my opinion this is achievable our objective is that winning colours stain remover develops the reputation of being north americas favourite stain removing product thats what we are working toward for this brand
3104705 its great there are moments of truth that become amazing and fun for example i might be speaking with the owner of a hardware store when by coincidence an employee gets paint all over their pants at the mixing counter that we can clean up on the spot there are too many of these great moments for winning colours growing popularity to be a fluke its a pattern thats what we are developing

3104711 i think everyone is quite sad that the gallery will be closing
3104712 there are a number of wonderful artists who have participated and shown their work on a regular basis it will be kind of an artistic blow to the seacoast area
3104713 id say it covers pretty much every art form that you can imagine everything from watercolors of local scenes to oils of beautiful nature it also includes abstract art just about every form of art you can imagine but its all done by seacoast artists
3104714 needless to say we are all very disappointed that the shop cant continue because this gallery was such an incredibly beautiful move for us from our previous location below the water street bookstore that space although less expensive was really off the beaten track this is right on water street has a beautiful storefront window and gets a lot of foot traffic
3104715 its just that people are holding onto their money to pay for staples like food fuel and gasoline so art is not as desirable as it seems these days
3104716 its very unique in todays marketplace to have a piece of original artwork our pieces are reasonably priced and offer a variety of artwork
3104717 we are hoping area residents rally around us for the auction we are going to have to make a sad situation a little better
3104718 the space is so awkward it had a lot of wall space and because it is three floors it doesnt really lend itself to a lot of businesses
3104719 we are really sad to close the place we really loved it

3104768 ben noticed bends in the middle of two different seamount chains tracks of volcanoes on the ocean floor off of eastern australia
3104769 the chains were offset at the same time that the volcano migration slowed on land giving further evidence that the plateau arrived then and caused an abrupt westward plate excursion
3104770 we think the immense plateau which is roughly the size of greenland blocked australias northerly movement rapidly altering the pattern of volcanic activity between 26 and 23 ma
3104771 before the collision the pacific plate was sinking or subducting below the australian plate
3104772 however the arrival of the plateau jammed and reversed this system such that the australian plate now sinks below the pacific

3104793 although amzn has not disclosed kindle sales our collection of data points leads us to double our 08 unit assumption from 190 000 to 380 000 in its first year 2002 thats exactly how many ipods were sold turns out the kindle is becoming the aapl ipod of the book world
3104794 kindles a great product but we dont think the addressable market is anywhere near the size of the ipod market
3104795 we think it will ultimately appeal to a much smaller slice of the market than the ipod
3104796 a dearth of gadget gifts in the fourth quarter except the 3g iphone
3104797 i think its still a pretty small story its a nice story but its a little early for it to be driving the stock
3104798 over half of all people who shop online go to amazon first

3104811 i spoke to morris from jail just yesterday fowles said after the win over china

3104823 on april 1 2009 in just 232 days we will have no other choice but to reduce spending and close a 6 4 billion budget gap
3104824 the downturn in the economy has now elevated the problems limiting our options and creating significant out year budget gaps going forward
3104825 governor paterson is right to propose actions and bring everyone to the table to address the states growing budget problems now rather than later
3104826 hes going to bring something very special to the team
3104827 having the only current major champion at the ryder cup will add significant weight to our campaign

3104830 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3104831 but i think the pressure will be on them a little more than maybe its going to be on us were playing on our home soil and europe is going to have everything to lose here in these matches
3104832 its usually the other way around even though they won five of the last six somehow they just seem to come in as the underdog

3104855 our 37 all cash proposal clearly offers republic stockholders a better and more certain value alternative than is contemplated in the republic allied transaction

3104857 consistent with its fiduciary duties the board of directors of republic services along with its legal and financial advisers will carefully review the revised proposal received from waste management the board will respond following its review
3104858 have tended to curb the protections enjoyed by citizens against the power of the state
3104859 democratic limits on the power of the penal system reforms of public security and penal justice
3104860 counter reform is authoritarian it undermines human rights and is aimed at scaling back guarantees that were seen as excessive
3104861 it stiffens penalties and grants greater powers to the pnc and prosecutors increasing their control over the population
3104862 that led to the transformation from an inquisitorial system to an adversarial system
3104863 there is no scientific support for that there is a belief that by stiffening sentences people will stop committing crimes but thats a mistake criminals are more afraid of an effective investigation and trial than of the length of the sentences that figure in the penal code

3104871 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3104872 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3104873 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3104874 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3104875 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3104876 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3104877 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3104878 estou satisfeito com a redu o da infla o em praticamente todos os ndices de atacado e de varejo isso significa que esse processo de alta de commodities est sendo revertido isso vai fazer com que a nossa infla o possa caminhar mais rapidamente para o centro da meta no futuro

3104901 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3104902 we are not staying home with our children by default
3104903 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal

3105004 germanys progress to the global summit of the womens game was as impressive as it was inexorable the reigning european champions did not concede a single goal on their way to defending the games top prize at the fifa womens world cup china 2007

3105031 our requests are purely linked to the objective value of the player
3105032 i always remind him how grateful he should be that destiny saw him grow up in the juve youth system the club should keep a tight grip on him
3105033 he is a player who gives his best in the final third
3105034 but at empoli i saw he was also used with success as a wide left midfielder when he returns we will discuss it and see what he can do
3105035 i think he could easily be the alternative to pavel nedved albeit with different responsibilities and characteristics
3105036 i hadnt actually got any goals until saturday so hopefully ive saved it until the start of the season and during the season
3105037 if you get called upon youve just got to go out there and do a professional job and thats what well do were professional players
3105038 the ambition has always got to be to finish higher than 10th
3105039 we set ourselves a good base really we werent in the dogfight at the bottom and weve got to build on what weve started and achieve more
3105040 we left 12 men on base we had all kinds of chances to win the game and we couldnt get it done i dont have to say nothing to them on a night like this i dont have to say a word
3105041 there is nothing at all to say about berbatov were looking at options elsewhere
3105042 wed like to add to our squad and were making moves in that direction were trying
3105043 theres an issue with scoring goals at the moment but if youre making as many chances as we are we shouldnt worry about it because players will come back and we will eventually add to the squad
3105044 lack of discussion could mean that people are fine with how things are now besides you
3105045 in this situation your going to need contributors to that book to participate in the discussions voice opinions on what should be changed in written form on wiki and come to some sort of consensus before anything changes regardless of any individuals interpretation
3105046 again requirement that a actual discussion takes place is only on your head you only must provide an idea for other to express objection and grant them a chance to do it
3105047 the message that i got was that he was telling me that he was with me
3105048 i feel proud and blessed that i have this picture
3105049 i cant say whether dimitar is happy or not i just know that i would be very happy to keep him here
3105050 i would be absolutely delighted if berbatov was still at the club after the end of the transfer window i really hope that is the case
3105051 he is a magnificent player and we want to enjoy another season of him at this club
3105052 the window closes on august 31 so anything can happen before then
3105053 players might come in and players might leave it is all possible

3105057 all that is important is that we get a good start and when i say start i mean the first eight games

3105063 at the moment i am not close to concluding any transfer deal because i am too busy here
3105064 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us

3105303 the prime minister was freed this afternoon along with three other government officials i understand that only the president is still being held
3105304 the six representatives firmly condemned the coup and said it was unacceptable to overthrow a democratically elected president and demanded that the president and his prime minister are set free and constitutional order is restored
3105305 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3105306 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3105307 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3105308 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication
3105309 the soldiers were provided with combat first aid by other members of the sotg to stabilise their condition and the area surrounding the blast site was secured in preparation for a helicopter casualty evacuation
3105310 one of the greatest challenges facing photographers is dealing with the limitations of film or digital cameras in regard to dynamic range over the years photographers have been and continue to be very creative in managing the limited range of light in which film or digital sensors can capture
3105311 the much awaited adobe lightroom 2 0 was released july 29th after a brief 4 month beta period with out hesitation for reasons ill explain later i upgraded my copy of lightroom to version 2 the day it was announced
3105312 we have made investments to diversify our revenues and grow in new markets to develop new services and solutions and build new delivery centres globally these investments are already beginning to pay dividends the above average revenue growth from our emerging markets is helping to accelerate overall company growth
3105313 as we continue to grow and scale beyond 100 000 employees we need an organisational structure that is nimble and agile to allow us to capture new growth opportunities
3105314 this is a pilot to offer smes an end to end solution which includes infrastructure management networking applications and solutions like mail and merchandising it will be a vendor agnostic platform the pricing will follow either rental or revenue sharing model the solutions will be pre configured and cost anywhere between rs 50 500 crore the solution will be web based too
3105315 margin pressures are affecting even large players hence the domestic indian market is a viable proposition
3105316 theres a perceived conflict of interest which we need to rectify however as new telcos come in and the competition hots up we believe that our ability to manage business growth from customer acquisitions will help us we also have a host of pilots in our laboratory in chennai for telecom enabled services a complete network test factory in delhi besides mobility solutions for banks and so on
3105317 in five to 10 years you will see a dramatic change in the way people are serviced by 2015 there may be no such term like business process outsourcing or offshoring
3105318 you will have five or six large players by 2015 with multiple lines of services across low cost delivery centres these firms will have thousands of workers in different geographies servicing many industry verticals
3105319 indian companies will acquire some of the low rung international incumbents to gain on the branding size services and vertical portfolio and c suite relationships given that the global valuations have hit lows and indian companies have strong acquisition currency only leads to a conclusion that this is an opportune time tcs being the leader of the pack is the right candidate to pursue this lead
3105320 there will be a lot of consolidation especially with smaller firms being bought out by the bigger ones smaller firms will have an established customer base niche offerings and respectful order book will command a premium the others will have to make do with lower valuations
3105321 the super achievers or tier 1 firms of today will have built significant operations in western countries by 2015 either through acquisition or through aggressive investment backed organic growth my bet is that there will only be one or two such firms
3105322 a friend passed on this amusing little gallery by world class photojournalist vincent laforet
3105323 many thanks to all who replied to the last post it means a lot and i know tom was overwhelmed by the reaction and that has re upped his determination
3105324 the idea is that people raise 3 000 half of which covers the cost of the trip and the other half goes straight into building the centre
3105325 i was pleased with his poise pleased with his composure weve been pleased with him all camp
3105326 you never know how a guy is going to respond in a game he was very relaxed very poised
3105327 inflicted damage on operational systems troops and military facilities of georgia
3105328 overnight as many as 50 russian bombers were reported operating simultaneously over georgia targeting civilian populations in cities and villages as well as radio and telecommunications sites
3105329 during their mop up operations in south ossetia georgian commandos have thrown hand grenades into the basements where civilians were hiding
3105330 they dont have those bargain basement offers that they used to have two to three years ago
3105331 the largest numbers of unemployed fishers ever are trying to emigrate to europe using their small fishing boats and pirogues which leads to a number of people dying on the high seas
3105332 selfish europe how the economic partnership agreements would further contribute to the decline of fish stocks and exacerbate the food crisis in senegal
3105333 the european union can satisfy only 50 percent of its internal demand for fish from its own fish resources the deficit has been filled for years through access
3105334 european fishery operators present in senegalese waters contribute significantly to the overexploitation of fishing stocks and provide little long term gains for the industry
3105335 from a peak of 10 707 pirogues in 1997 the fleet declined to a mere 5 615 in 2005
3105336 many fishing companies are only operating part time due to the severe supply deficits of high value species and the average volume of fish exports has fallen by a total of 32 percent over the course of the past 15 years this has led to companies laying off 50 60 percent of their staff
3105337 the full economic partnership agreements proposed by the european commission which include services and investment provisions are likely to lock in and worsen such practices
3105338 companies which fish with a proper licence routinely exceed the quotas they are granted as senegal doesnt have enough resources to patrol its waters
3105339 fishing authorities also have problems controlling boats that move from one fishing zone to another while crossing borders
3105340 trawler owners play with different licenses and if they cant get a license from senegal they have no problem obtaining one from a neighbouring country
3105341 between 1997 and 2001 aerial surveys of guineas territorial waters found that 60 percent of the 2 313 vessels spotted were committing offences surveys of sierra leone and guinea bissau over the same period found levels of illegal fishing at 24 percent of 947 vessels and 24 of 926 vessels respectively
3105342 a european ship owner forms a joint venture to enable his boats to fly the senegalese flag this allows him to avoid strict controls and access to fish in waters reserved to senegalese boats

3105346 the aspirational goal the one that really gets shareholders hearts beating faster is that cablevision liquidate and sell all of its assets
3105347 in one scenario they would spin off madison square garden and the dolan family interest would spin off with it
3105348 a clear sign that the dolan family is seriously interested in some form of buyback dividend and or spin off sale of non core assets
3105349 consumers were happy to embrace standard dvd when that format arrived because the improvement in quality over vhs videotapes was dramatic standard dvd didnt require the purchase of a new tv either in contrast while half of the respondents to our survey rated quality as much better than standard dvd another 40 per cent termed it only somewhat better and most are very satisfied with the performance of their current dvd players
3105350 hij was een echte heer en een zeer warme en getalenteerde artiest
3105351 ik heb een van mijn beste maatjes verloren en dat is niet makkelijk te bevatten
3105352 ik weet dat een vraagteken niet is toegestaan als god ergens een punt achter zet dus ik zal niet klagen over de beslissing van god om hem bij zich te roepen
3105353 hij zal deel blijven uitmaken van mijn muzikale leven elke keer als ik het liedje deja vu zing
3105354 hij was een echte heer en een zeer warme en getalenteerde artiest voor wie ik respect had en die ik heb bewonderd
3105355 ik zal hem missen en zijn bijdrage aan de entertainmentindustrie en de mensheid
3105356 call tom ridge to washington from wherever hes vacationing and put him to work
3105357 you could tell from my reaction that it was fun
3105358 i definitely dont think ive ever sort of celebrated that much after a race in my life
3105359 its the one time he gets to really be a part of something
3105360 we were talking this morning back in the village about that race was better than the 800 free in athens
3105361 as a whole five of the teams broke the world record if you think about it we broke the world record by four seconds and won by eight one hundredths of a second
3105362 going up there with four guys but youre really one we all have to swim the perfect race we swam that perfect race this morning

3105364 three days ago it sounded like a fantastic idea for a film
3105365 now it seems almost too sad to watch buying a ticket to soul men could end up feeling like youre purchasing a seat at someones funeral
3105366 you dont want to assume that you cant influence your fate in a tough economy
3105367 always make it clear to your employer that your preference is them
3105368 often its the person who is the least costly to an employer who provides the same value as others whos going to be the last to go
3105369 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3105370 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3105371 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything
3105372 it seems just unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3105373 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3105374 clearly elisabeth is a victim in this as well obviously she physically was unscathed having to deal with this has been hard for her she has shown incredible strength the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it
3105375 obviously its a lot of tears and a lot of hugs
3105376 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3105377 not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
3105378 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
3105379 pocos padres conocen a ciencia cierta lo que el t rmino implica ellos s lo perciben un ni o sumamente inquieto dif cil de controlar o contener impulsivo y con problemas de tipo escolar
3105380 estuve en un conflicto conmigo misma al saber la muerte de mam pod a cuestionar a dios y preguntarle porque se la hab a llevado as tan de pronto pero luego de meditar profundamente decid en vez de lamentarme darle gracias por los 75 a os de edad que nos permiti tenerla

3105385 todos daban gracias al se or y a una le cantaban esta alabanza dios es bueno su gran amor por israel perdura para siempre y todo el pueblo alab con grandes aclamaciones al se or porque se hab an echado los cimientos del templo
3105386 si juzgas que tienes pocos bienes para agradecer a dios agr desele al menos los muchos males que no tienes en la vida
3105387 para que te cante y te glorifique y no me quede callado se or mi dios siempre te dar gracias

3105395 were knee deep in the studio in oakland ca recording our new album right now which is coincidentally directly accross the street from the club were playing at and will be playing this show as were finishing up the mixing come check it out well play a bunch of new songs for your asses
3105396 as promised we were able to put together a short clip of us hard at work in the studio check out day one of our studio report
3105397 the force unleashed demo is not coming out this week
3105398 if x play said that its coming out this week theyre wrong
3105399 they will have more information about the demo in their show on the 14th
3105400 ah jane over the years i have come to sincerely appreciate your ingenuous nature however my mental development has far outstripped yours and i fear i must expunge you from my life or risk eternal retardation do not torture me with your tenacity my mores demand that i sally forth in search of new companions that more accurately fit with my erudite paradigm now if you will excuse me i am absorbed in my reading of the iliad usuallly attributed to homer come hither sophocles
3105401 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
3105402 because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop
3105403 our legal team are going to be exhausting every possible channel for holding the police accountable for the draconian use of stop and search measures for the things they confiscated and for their violent incursions on to the camp
3105404 every year police use the supposed existence of a hardcore minority as justification for their heavy handedness and every year this hardcore minority fails to materialise
3105405 werent you afraid of all those amish gangs that roam freely through the heartland of the state
3105406 now the clearfield county fair is steeped in all the americana infused county fair tradition you might imagine from a fair that is in its 135th year of existence or something old like that
3105407 moving on thats my way of saying a bunch of stuff happened in between then and after then but i just dont feel like writing about it show time came and the grandstand is full and the capacity crowd is primed by our friends in great white which is perfect because it happens to be
3105408 by now the entire audience is in some sort of funnel cake induced daze at the spectacle before them
3105409 if for whatever reason they really cant do it think of cutting to one cup or switching to decaf
3105410 hard rock tunnel boring machine tbm no es buring aunque bueno aun as deb nox
3105411 faaaaaaaaaaaakkkeeeeeeeeeeeno pongan cosas tan falsas por que yo confiaba en noticiaschuecas com
3105412 i told her about the milkman who looks like a weasel and quietly fantasizes about slowly pushing his letter opener into my spine
3105413 i told her about the president possessed by the devil and a lust for dead boys in these lines which he addresses to the victim we see this condemnation in which he lives his anger at the actions of the system which surrounds him and his own denial that such actions as he has just committed are those of a madman he is the one who is sane everything else is a dream and washed it down with contamination and tap water its slowly eating my insides
3105414 were dead the locust swarm from open mouths that sing thy kingdom come the shotguns warm the room is red the sky is always gray and underneath the godless gray a billion corpses pray theres enough rat poison for us all
3105415 i like to see the predator attracting bodily fluids luring wild animals directly to my vagina and newborn
3105416 well i like the salt in my episiotomy well i would if there was a doctor around to perform one if i needed it
3105417 my inference is that they concluded that this administration would not release hamdan at the end of his sentence but the next one might
3105418 i think hamdans continued detention past the end of his sentence although justifiable under the law of war would be a political train wreck and i think the panel made an effort to protect the u s from further international criticism
3105419 for seven years uniformed military officers have pushed back against the administrations most extreme and unlawful detention and interrogation policies only to be overruled by white house lawyers with little respect for the constitution or geneva conventions
3105420 we may never know what the commission members were thinking but we saw what they did they ensured that mr hamdans fate will be determined by a future administration with more respect for the rule of law
3105421 holding hamdan past the end of his term is only going to further inflame anti american feelings in the muslim world where the u s will clearly be perceived as continuing to discriminate on the basis of nationality or religion
3105422 the flights are ongoing to redeploy the elements of the georgian contingent so that they can deal with the security issues in their country
3105423 we can accommodate that obviously it was not expected but it is something the effects of which we can certainly mitigate
3105424 if theres anyone who can tell me im doing the right thing by going through with this treatment
3105425 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
3105426 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
3105427 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
3105428 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
3105429 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
3105430 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
3105431 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
3105432 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
3105433 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
3105434 we are now in a fight against the great russia
3105435 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
3105436 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
3105437 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too
3105438 oh wow heres a product searching for a market rather than an innovation addressing an unmet market need
3105439 kindle is becoming the ipod of the book world kindle could be one of the top gadget gifts this holiday season
3105440 mulder si scully sunt atrasi din nou n lumea dosarelor x de un caz
3105441 e o poveste care implica dificultatile de a mijloci credinta si stiinta chiar sugereaza lupta lui mulder cu credinta sa
3105442 filmul cuprinde toate lucrurile bune apreciate de telespectatori la serial e nfricosator sinistru si misterios cu dosarele x am speriat deseori oamenii cu ce nu am aratat si am folosit aceasta tactica si n fim
3105443 cred ca cea mai buna parte n dosarele x era ca te putea nfricosa de orice nu spunea povestile de groaza tipice si nici nu adera la conventiile populare genului iar acest film respecta traditia de a arata lucruri pe care nu le ai vedea n majoritatea filmelor de groaza
3105444 you cant ask much more out of him right now for what he does he keeps making plays
3105445 it would be great to get a guy like watkins or a guy like rookie wide receiver chaz schilens if they were able to make the team
3105446 they both are guys that can contribute on special teams
3105447 i didnt know where i was going to be after each year whether i was going to sign with that team or if i was going to move on
3105448 but now im extremely excited i have a great opportunity on a team that is on the rise this team has great potential and im excited to hopefully be a part of it
3105449 it feels good to come out here and practice and hear the fans go oooh ahhh with the big catches interceptions and big hits
3105450 it just gives you energy for practice and we enjoy that
3105451 its just good to relate with the fans because lets face it weve been terrible the last five years and for them to still come out and support us the way they do my hats off to them
3105452 so i had darren stand next to me and told shane to throw him the ball
3105453 it was good to see coach rob ryan compete rob heard me whisper that so he whispered to hiram about 10 yards ahead of him to go cover him so it really didnt work
3105454 lets try to make everyone in america commit suicide rather than listening to us talk
3105455 i didnt have the year i wanted to have last year i could only control my part and obviously i didnt play as much as i wanted
3105456 hes worked his tail off thats never been an issue hes a good character person i think he can play and he can add something to somebodys position
3105457 its a situation where you want to go where you are celebrated not tolerated
3105458 in many ways i look at this as a gift
3105459 my elbow got caught in a guys chin strap buckle
3105460 the door is open to any player we feel makes us better but there is no one out there at this time that we feel strongly about
3105461 ive talked to my mum quite a bit and the phones ringing and theres a lot of media interest and of course its just my mum in christchurch shes not equipped to deal with something of this magnitude not that shes not capable its just that its so surreal that all of a sudden she gets drawn into this
3105462 we have a small family in new zealand but were tight i know shes hurting and shes very much a part of the broader picture
3105463 our two families were very close and it is a good in law relationship shes rocked its hard for all of us
3105464 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3105465 i am passionate about the game my job i enjoy coaching volleyball has been wonderful to elisabeth and i but at this stage its very easy for me to focus on the task at hand which is taking care of my immediate family
3105466 once weve got it taken care of we can look at other things in life but right now thats purely where my focus is
3105467 the one thing that has been incredible has been the huge groundswell of support to help us pick up the pieces and help us manage this difficult situation as best as we can he said
3105468 interest has been global but in no way have we exposed ourselves with dealing with our emails and our phonecalls or anything like that its just too overwhelming we appreciate that everyone is with us we are just in no capacity to deal with that right now
3105469 stood for all the right things and he lived them
3105470 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence there is no indication her that there was any pre meditation it seems unfortunately to be a case of the wrong place at the wrong time certainly in our opinion that is the way it seems to be
3105471 it hurts its its something that no one should have to go through lifes not fair so its never going to be about that kind of stuff
3105472 at the end of the day it happened and it seems the the sooner we can come to grips with that and kind of process it the better off were going to be anger isnt an emotion im going to allow myself to indulge in
3105473 certainly the team has been influenced by this its not exactly how you would want to prepare for your first match having to deal with a tragedy of this nature
3105474 my start was pretty slow i actually got dropped a little bit so i had to work a bit harder in that second 500m
3105475 i did put in a few big ones at the 1000m but didnt quite get the response that i wanted from the boat and i need to work on kicking on in that last 500m
3105476 its just a matter of putting things into place in the semifinal and really being on my game
3105477 it will be who wants it the most and whos firing on the day
3105478 i think it will be if not the death of northland rugby it will certainly be hugely catastrophic rugby up here is not just a game its hugely part of the community
3105479 we have had our financial issues but that doesnt make it any easier its not a palatable decision thats for sure
3105480 for the last two years weve finished in the first 10 so i dont think anyone could reasonably say that our playing performance has been inhibited
3105481 in terms of registrations we are about number eight in the country population base i think we are in the first 10 if not higher
3105482 it is regrettable that our detractors continue to impose more sanctions
3105483 we therefore call on britain and its allies to remove sanctions to enable us to freely chart our destiny as a sovereign people
3105484 instead we will be going one better and will focus on long term unemployed by requiring them to get paid work and get off the benefit
3105485 within 12 months of taking office national will require everyone who has been on the dole for more than a year to re apply for their benefit and undergo a comprehensive work assessment
3105486 the 1990s is back and today the national party showed how bereft they really are of new ideas
3105487 the reality is that people get off the dpb at the earliest opportunity that they can and evidence that people stay on it longer than they need to be simply isnt there
3105488 long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices
3105489 were really indicating that those people are the ones we are going to encourage to undertake 15 hours part time work or training or be at least looking for work
3105490 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3105491 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3105492 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3105493 there are times youd like to lash out and say something but at the same time you have to step back and look at the situation first
3105494 thats more of an emotional or rash decision to go out and say something you have to figure out why certain things are happening and look at the plus side of it this is a situation where theres definitely a big plus im getting the chance to play with one of the best players in the game and im getting to learn and see how he prepares himself
3105495 you have to know your place and know your role
3105496 im in a place and role in my career where i cant make a fuss about it i still have a lot to prove in this game

3105500 the blackberry bold is a breakthrough smartphone for both professional and personal use
3105501 the blackberry bold smartphone delivers an amazing combination of functionality performance usability and design making it an ideal choice for business professionals and power users
3105502 the blackberry bold smartphone perfectly combines state of the art communications and multimedia functionality attractive design high speed internet access and an intuitive user experience making it the perfect smartphone solution
3105503 rim is no longer a mobile office e mail player it has evolved into a deeply embedded enterprise vendor and we continue to push this as the key differentiator
3105504 so while apple nokia motorola and now htc corp continue to compete on enterprise hardware designs they cannot stack up to rim in terms of the enterprise ecosystems rim has in place
3105505 this remains a crucial difference that will make competition here almost meaningless
3105506 the battle for higher end consumers has escalated significantly the next iphone will boast 3g and may get out the door before the bold but it will be quite interesting to see how the bold does as a prosumer device
3105507 our view remains that rim and apple are market complementary and that each will continue to find its own set of users
3105508 thats why i can say its the undisputed most powerful software of its kind see normally if you were on any other website you would probably be getting a whole bunch of reasons why you should buy now blah blah

3105529 well the olympic games are more than a chance for the worlds athletes to excel they also give the host nation an opportunity to shine for china and its 1 3 billion people the beijing games are feeding a groundswell of pride
3105530 from designer clothes to new cars china is getting rich democracies once bragged that theirs was the only way to economic success china is doing it the communist way
3105531 well china wants to throw a successful olympics party and so far theyre doing just fine with plenty of enthusiasm spreading from beijing pretty much around the world
3105532 beijing has the welcome banners out to a half million visitors more foreigners at one time than the country has seen since the mongol invasion a thousand years ago

3105547 because of the large uncertainty we have in the radiative forcing of aerosols there is a corresponding large uncertainty in the degree of radiative forcing overall
3105548 this introduces a large uncertainty in the degree of warming predicted by climate change models
3105549 what we heard from the environment department today is that for every taxpayer dollar spent were getting 20 per cent less renewable energy now than we were last year
3105550 thats a failure of policy for a government that claims to be caring about addressing climate change
3105551 it has stopped people installing units of a decent size which means were not getting the reduction in carbon emissions that we should and it has failed to deliver the financial stability the industry wants to ensure it has some long term certainty

3105554 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site versus ebays starts from an incorrect basis
3105555 based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites
3105556 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue
3105557 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise
3105558 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting

3105563 we have had no obstacles or disturbances during our training camp
3105564 i feel that if i had given enough instructions these injuries would have been avoided
3105565 i feel tired and need some rest but because i want to do even more in the closing ceremony and the closing ceremonies for the paralympics games i will not
3105566 i was very impressed with footsteps made of fireworks as well as the theme song
3105567 i tried some new players today to see if they fit well in our system
3105568 it is difficult to motivate them to come for training knowing that there is nothing at stake but we will try our best though at times they complain that they do not have money to come for training
3105569 which was bumped to today because of this special week of awesomeness
3105570 the west and especially the united states could have prevented this war we have arrived at a watershed moment in the wests post cold war relations with russia
3105571 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3105572 our voters and edwards voters were the same people they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3105573 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3105574 our voters and edwards voters were the same people they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3105575 the composition and dynamics of north atlantic communities will change
3105576 but whether that will help or harm local fisheries is an open question humans may have to adapt as well
3105577 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
3105578 because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop
3105579 our legal team are going to be exhausting every possible channel for holding the police accountable for the draconian use of stop and search measures for the things they confiscated and for their violent incursions on to the camp
3105580 every year police use the supposed existence of a hardcore minority as justification for their heavy handedness and every year this hardcore minority fails to materialise
3105581 dear god i am scared tired and have had enough please give me peace please help me amen

3105584 our voters and edwards voters were the same people they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3105585 we understand this is not a social experiment but an institution of higher education that must be restored and prepared to compete with its peers across the united states
3105586 there is nothing more important to ohios economic future than making sure that we have a world class system of education
3105587 these forums are the beginning of a conversation with the people of ohio about how best to reform education in our great state
3105588 its a silent but deadly source of greenhouse gases that contributes more to global warming than the entire world transportation sector yet politicians almost never discuss it and environmental lobbyists and other green activist groups seem unaware of its existence
3105589 livestock are a leading source of greenhouse gases why isnt anyone raising a stink
3105590 the rumen is a sort of continuous culture of anaerobic microbes including protozoa and bacteria which collectively ferment the starch and cellulose of grass to yield fatty acids methane and carbon dioxide
3105591 this blows a gaping hole in the governments global warming rhetoric and the action plans of big environmental organizations even the green party

3105596 a kind providence has placed in our breasts a hatred of the unjust and cruel in order that we may preserve ourselves from cruelty and injustice
3105597 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site versus ebays starts from an incorrect basis
3105598 based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites

3105604 the city has lost an outstanding public servant councilmember fannie lewis loved the city she believed in the people and she worked hard for them this is a tremendous loss and my thoughts and prayers are with her family and everyone she touched
3105605 i am saddened to learn of the loss of fannie lewis a truly great clevelander i had the good fortune to meet fannie multiple times she is a special person who stood witness to so many events in her life through the turbulent times and the tranquil times she always worked tirelessly on behalf of her community those who knew her and benefited from her hard work will grieve her passing while remembering and celebrating the greatness of her life
3105606 it would be unfair to consumers with accounts at other firms as well as to the firms that settled if our investigation were to slow down or stop
3105607 our investigations focus is shifting to the next group of market participants
3105608 the purchase and use of these ingredients by the pet food industry not only provides nutritional needs for pets at reasonable costs but provides an important source of income to american farmers and processors of meat poultry and seafood products for human consumption
3105609 there is virtually no information on the bioavailability of nutrients for companion animals in many of the common dietary ingredients used in pet foods
3105610 to process as for industrial use to render livestock carcasses and to extract oil from fat blubber etc by melting
3105611 the grain that would go into pet food is not a high quality grain which means that the grain used in pet food is not fit for human consumption and therefore not a threat to the human population
3105612 when an ingredient or a combination of ingredients derived from animals poultry or fish constitute 95 or more of the total weight of all ingredients of a pet food the name or names of such ingredient s may form part of the product name of the pet food provided that where more than one ingredient is part of such product name then all such ingredient names shall be in the same size style and color print
3105613 when an ingredient or a combination of ingredients constitutes at least 25 but less than 95 of the total weight of all ingredients of a dog or cat food mixture the name or names of such ingredient or ingredients may form a part of the product name of the pet food if each of the ingredients constitute at least 3 of the product weight excluding water used for processing and only if the product name also includes a primary descriptive term such as dinner platter or similar designation so that the product name describes the contents of the product in accordance with an established law custom or usage or so that the product name is not misleading
3105614 no flavor designation shall be used on a pet food label unless the flavor is detected by a recognized test method or is one the presence of which provides a characterisitic distinguishable by the pet
3105615 processing is the wild card in nutritional value that is by and large simply ignored
3105616 all our problems come from foreigners getting drunk smashing windows and stealing
3105617 mussolini had his positive side the streets were safe in his day
3105618 these shocking and startling figures mean that every council tax payer in staffordshire is paying nearly 30 per head towards funding this very worrying level of absence
3105619 we need to see a range of targeted initiatives aimed at reducing this drag on council resources
3105620 the cost of sickness absence quoted by the opposition is way off the mark due to crude and basic calculations
3105621 the actual cost is considerably lower at around 9 6m which we are working hard to lower
3105622 all of this suggests the stock market may prove less useful as a leading indicator of profits and economic growth but it also suggests stocks are likely to get out of balance more often creating opportunities for savvy investors
3105623 increasingly focused on breaking news and short term swings rather than longer term fundamentals
3105624 just because markets are unpredictable doesnt mean they are efficient
3105625 the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought
3105626 the spirit is now renewing every part of my life
3105627 the rfs remains an important tool in our ongoing efforts to reduce americas greenhouse gas submissions and less in our dependents on foreign oil in aggressive yet practical ways
3105628 frantic requests to web sites asking them to take down the illicit clips and restrict authorized video to host countries
3105629 in the age of internet almost anywhere why be tied to a tv
3105630 no longer have the same viewer monopoly they had 30 years ago and why dont they see that
3105631 computer graphics meticulously created over a period of months and inserted into the coverage electronically at exactly the right moment
3105632 it would have been prohibitive to have tried to film it live
3105633 we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route
3105634 as far as we are concerned we let off the fireworks thats whats important to us

3105641 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
3105642 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
3105643 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
3105644 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
3105645 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more
3105646 if hes ready to open up the ocs whos to say that obama wont withdraw support for a cap and trade policy when he gets in office

3105649 russian actions in clear violation of international law have no place in 21st century europe
3105650 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire
3105651 i was betting on the fact that gas prices were going to level off
3105652 had i read the handwriting on the wall a little better i wouldnt have bought outside the madison area
3105653 thats one of the first issues they bring up when they tell me theyre looking for a house
3105654 proximity to where you work and things you like to do is always a plus
3105655 to the extent that high gas prices make that more of a plus well see you can find anecdotal evidence that some people are thinking about that now
3105656 people perceive cambridge to be farther than it is because it isnt four lanes all the way
3105657 people are choosing to relocate real close to their jobs rather than look outside
3105658 prior to 2006 a lot of madison workers were coming up to columbia county to look for homes
3105659 theres very little of that right now the buyers im working with want to stay in madison
3105660 i just wish i could pick it up and pop it a little closer to my job its just the long commute from belleville to waunakee the gas prices are so atrocious it just makes us more anxious to sell
3105661 if its outside of town the price is going to be depreciated
3105662 it used to be an option for buyers to commute that is now a much more difficult economic decision
3105663 i dont think gas is going to be as much of an issue as it was in the 70s
3105664 the perception today is its going to be more expensive to live in the rural communities when in reality the housing costs are less there
3105665 the biggest influence for us is that my husband teaches out here and our day care center is here also
3105666 just up ahead is the tomb of national hero mao zedong
3105667 until dogs and cats can go on the pill or wear condoms we need to help them practice safe sex by spaying and neutering
3105668 millions of homeless animals are turned in to shelters every year because there simply arent enough good homes for them all the answer is as easy as abc animal birth control which means get your fido or fluffy fixed

3106118 at a time when the process of nuclear nonproliferation is at a stand still i feel bound to entreat those in authority to resume with greater determination negotiations for a progressive and mutually agreed dismantling of existing nuclear weapons in renewing this appeal i know i am echoing the desire of all those concerned for the future of humanity
3106119 our peace and justice committee participated in pax christis peoples peace initiative in 2007
3106120 we had several meetings answering the call from pax christi to really consider how we could promote peace on earth as a church as a community and as individuals
3106121 the peace and justice committee did a lot of thinking about this request and we sent in a summary about nuclear abolishment to pax christi
3106122 they are going to publish a book they polled many catholic parishes catholic institutions and catholic universities as well as priests religious and brothers all over the united states who all came out strongly against nuclear weapons and encouraged nuclear disarmament
3106123 i was born in 1939 when there was tension and upset in the country with the prospect of going to war with germany
3106124 then we went to war with japan during world war ii
3106125 you are continuing to build their business if you do that versus building your ow
3106126 it happened in the dark of night so no one heard it
3106127 but when we saw it we knew it was more than we could clean up
3106128 we had catholic and mormon volunteers from all over the valley
3106129 it was really a tremendous self sacrifice in response to peoples needs
3106130 we burned everything that could be burned under the watchful eye of the fire department then we sold the scrap metal and used that money to repair some of the farm machinery that was damaged in the collapse
3106131 one hundred and 13 people signed up to help us clean up and they have become our prayer list
3106132 we also hope the snow will just slide down the vinyl walls instead of staying on the roofs the only building we have left to cover is the chapel
3106133 theyre really accepting blessed sacrament is smaller and more family oriented
3106134 john and shelly valdez coordinators of youth ministry at blessed sacrament are like my second parents
3106135 seventh grade was a difficult time i missed my friends but i got really close to my family
3106136 i got along with the boys better than the girls
3106137 freshman year was my favorite by far because we beat judge memorial catholic high school
3106138 when i was a freshman the varsity team seemed so big and i was so nervous my first game
3106139 the team had two hour practices seven days a week we switched coaches every year too there would be new tryouts and you would have to work for your spot again
3106140 i wont remember all the games but ill remember the girls
3106141 the girls are even closer because its more of a team sport
3106142 the spirit of christmas project was my favorite its cute to see all the little kids they dont get anything else

3106146 what fr wixted has done for the soldiers at dugway has had a profound effect
3106147 fr matt always had the interest of people at heart and we knew we came first with him
3106148 we know for a time your dream car was a mercedes benz but we couldnt find one of those we we so happy when you decided your dream car was a jaguar because we knew we could find one of those
3106149 the elevator beats having to take the stairs because i dont do stairs
3106150 this elevator is not only a symbol of your generosity it is a sign of our outreach to all of our brothers and sisters particularly those who have a hard time with stairs or who cannot take the stairs at all
3106151 this is a sign of our desire to be one and to destroy any barriers whatsoever that keep us from being together with christ
3106152 i commend you for this great work i am so delighted to take the first official ride with your pastor and a couple of members although in my heart of hearts i pray that somebody has taken a ride before this to assure that it is safe and working properly
3106153 blessed are you lord our god and worthy of all praise for you have provided for the protecting of your creations for human labor and intelligence and you show your own power and goodness in the inventions of the human race grant that all those who use this elevator to improve their lives will recognize how wonderful you are in your works and learn to carry out your will more readily
3106154 we started raising money to renovate the existing elevator we held festivals bake sales received donations and our latino community would bring homemade mexican food to sell after mass they donated the proceeds to the elevator fund this has really been a mission wide project

3106165 we the leaders of once captive nations of eastern europe and now eu and nato members estonia latvia lithuania and poland express a deep concern over the russian federations actions toward georgia
3106166 one of the greatest challenges we face as a fire service is to stop the needless deaths of firefighters while in service to their communities
3106167 every day and across this nation firefighters are responding to emergencies that threaten the lives of their residents these same threats also threaten the lives of firefighters unfortunately we all lost far too many firefighters in 2007
3106168 maybe its me but now that im facing some of the conflicts and trying to solve them im finding folks sometimes want me to do anything but
3106169 realized that if i hated them after i got outside that gate then they would still have me i wanted to be free so i let it go it was an astonishing moment in my life it changed me
3106170 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site versus ebays starts from an incorrect basis
3106171 based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites
3106172 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue
3106173 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise
3106174 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting
3106175 letter to a new president commonsense lessons for our next leader

3106178 but if sen mccain is interested in receiving a copy of the book wed be happy to get him a copy
3106179 a big lie is still a lie tell the truth
3106180 let the press do its job even when that might sting
3106181 i would submit that a president who is unable to learn from his or her own mistakes and then to articulate for a curious public what he or she has learned is not prepared for that office
3106182 banished himself to the ignominious position of worst united states president ever
3106183 built much of its program around a basic commitment to lying
3106184 we must rebuild a culture of intolerance to lying and that must start close to home
3106185 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3106186 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3106187 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything
3106188 it seems just unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time

3106204 by naming a chamar as her political heir at a party convention here last week she has tried to divide the united dalit society which was the dream of babasaheb ambedkar and kanshi ram whose ideology she claims to been pursuing
3106205 though it is an internal matter of the bsp the practice of naming heirs is not an appropriate thing in democracy
3106206 the dreams of ambedkar and kanshi ram cannot be realised merely by putting up their giant statues
3106207 as per my reports people close to her are trying to keep her away from the people and her supporters by tricking her into believing that she faced a threat to her life
3106208 after ecuador deal it is now turkey to make inroads into the helicopter market it is an achievement for hal and we can now be sure that bad times for dhruv are over
3106209 once turkey operates the dhruvs and is satisfied with its performance maintenance and spares supply they will go in for more of the choppers this deal is one of the means for hal to get into the european helicopter market
3106210 under the wet lease turkey will use the dhruvs for five years and later purchase the choppers outright though it is not an outright sale at the moment the contract has a clause that provides turkey the option of buying the helicopters outright after the lease period
3106211 we are in negotiations with a couple of south american nations for supplying dhruv choppers we hope to finalise the deals with these countries in a month two or three countries will be part of our export orders soon

3106357 on 15th october 2002 two british mps named g thomas and robert evans met ltte leaders in wanni
3106358 norway is peeved that its behind the scenes efforts to have the european parliament pass a highly critical resolution condemning sri lanka did not find favour in strasbourg in september 2006 two amendments moved by british mep robert evans condemning colombo for freezing the assets of tro and calling on the eu to lift its restrictions on the ltte were defeated by a majority of about 30 votes each time less than 60 members were present in the chamber when the vote was taken evans apparently annoyed at his failure to do something for the ltte left the chamber soon after his amendments were defeated sources in strasbourg told the sunday times
3106359 those unfortunate tamils who arrive in the uk as refugees and have passed through these particular british charities are also potential recruits for ltte political lobbying and are mobilized for ltte rallies marches vigils meetings etc
3106360 the ltte is outlawed in india but the new delhi government seems to still be recognising that it is essential for both sides to communicate with one another if solutions are going to be found

3106363 brno veloce e impegnativa un po come il mugello e phillip island insomma una di quelle che preferisco ha detto laustraliano in 250 ho fatto un podio lanno scorso abbiamo vinto e dato che la moto va bene dovremmo riuscire a lottare di nuovo nelle prime posizioni abbiamo diversi punti da recuperare in campionato quindi non sar facile ma tutta la squadra sta lavorando tantissimo e di sicuro ci proveremo poi come andr andr dopo la gara di laguna seca sono tornato in australia ed ho potuto stare un po in famiglia e con mia moglie lontano dalle piste mi sono riposato ma non ho comunque smesso di allenarmi e adesso non vedo lora di tornare in pista
3106364 il periodo di vacanza mi ha dato la possibilit di riposarmi e recuperare per cui spero di essere a posto per la gara di brno

3106367 mijn team is sterk genoeg om het niveau te halen van het ek en ook om de kroaten op weg naar zuid afrika te weerstaan
3106368 een dag voor dat duel maak ik bekend wie de aanvoerder wordt

3106370 you are my son whom i love with you i am well pleased
3106371 so if crude costs 103 50 per barrel they are already collecting extra but crude is now selling at 118 120 per barrel at its peak which is 145 per barrel it was more than double the level the government projected its oil vat income and therefore collections should have also doubled so i cannot see how dof will lose money
3106372 the specific tax will ease the hardship of our people when the price of crude is high
3106373 this is a personal mission on my part administrative cases against officials will now be handled by our office this means trust and confidence in the ombudsman and this also means the commitment that i mean business
3106374 we cant be effective in our fight for environmental protection unless we can prosecute violators of laws and theres no better partner than the office of the ombudsman
3106375 in these cases some denr officials may be implicated and could be penalized administratively so they should be handled by a third party
3106376 the grp milf moa was prepared and finalized without adequate public consultations and transparency bordering on treachery in violation of the publics constitutional right to information
3106377 if indeed the grp milf moa committed to the creation of the bje and the bangsamoro homeland without going through the constitutional requirements then the same must be deemed an anomaly so fatal which cannot be cured except by striking the same as invalid
3106378 we are for peace but not for peace at any price not peace with a gun to our heads if there is a peace agreement it must go through the proper procedures and consultations not just between the government and the milf but with the citizens of mindanao
3106379 there are many things such as the provision which says that the ancestral domain is outside the public domain not even the state can make that statement
3106380 senator roxas is within his right to intervene in pending case with two litigants and there is a third party and you file a motion for intervention
3106381 we welcome sen roxas effort because it will increase the efforts to clarify the issue
3106382 this was understandable because when the north cotabato officials filed their petition they were not yet given a copy of the moa thus their lawyers were unable to question the unconstitutionality of its provisions
3106383 beyond their constitutional authority and jurisdiction and represents a grave abuse of discretion amounting to a lack of jurisdiction
3106384 our president and her advisers should exercise some degree of intelligence and civility
3106385 until now i cannot recall telling my kumpadre vice governor pi ol that i and particularly the military will not help north cotabato in case armed conflict arises as a result of them not helping the peace process
3106386 and since they are asking for ammunitions i suspect there are firearms already and so i asked whether they are licensed or not
3106387 at least 34 130 468 05 or p1 413 376 812 42 of swiss deposits deposited in escrow at pnb declared as fund belonging to and forfeited in favor of the government were not taken up in the books of accounts of pcgg in violation of section 63 of presidential decree 1445 government auditing code of the philippines
3106388 the balance of 34 130 486 or p1 413 376 812 42 remained unaccounted unrecorded in the books
3106389 complete accounting financial statements and other documents supporting the fund held in trust from the time the amount of 624 044 905 55 was deducted from the total deposits of 658 175 373 60 to determine the balance to be recorded in the books of account
3106390 the pcgg management commented that insofar as the swiss deposit with pnb is concerned they have no record on file
3106391 however verbal confirmation with officer at pnb trust department revealed that they are regularly submitting monthly financial reports to pcgg
3106392 the latest gainers losers gap of 50 percent gainers minus percent losers is the worst since sws began monitoring in april 1983
3106393 this brought net personal optimism or the difference of personal optimists over personal pessimists steadily down from 22 in june 2007 18 in september 2007 14 in december 2007 6 in march 2008 to 6 in june 2008
3106394 optimism about the future economy is based on a question about the economy in general and not about oneself in particular it is normal to be more optimistic about ones own quality of life than about the economy as a whole
3106395 at this point he camilo then tried to convince me of the rightness of the stand of the gsis and the sec i then told him that i will vote according to my conscience and that the most i can do is to have the issuance of the tro and the injunctive relief scheduled for oral arguments i also told him that during said hearing respondents must be able to convince me that the tro did not have a legal basis
3106396 did you consider that act of your brother as a criminal act it is an attempt to corrupt a public officer
3106397 it bothers me that a justice will say that leakage occurred
3106398 i am bothered that you did not mention the name of mr de borja in your letter to pj presiding justice vasquez and at the en banc
3106399 events like these should be immediately reported for the nbi to make an entrapment and prevent further occurrence
3106400 why should i inform justice roxas when he knows what is going on
3106401 look i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd
3106402 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
3106403 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
3106404 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
3106405 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd
3106406 we withstood the storm we calmed down and we just played a lot better basketball
3106407 maybe this was our biggest mistake that we think on the floor that this can be continued you know
3106408 generally peaceful no untoward incident except the isolated case in basilan hopefully the elections will proceed peacefully and in an orderly manner
3106409 so far comparatively with previous armm polls i see an improvement it has considerably improved definitely there has been a reduction in the anomalies because human handling has become limited and results of the elections would be known in a shorter time
3106410 well be studying if this ballot snatching in sumisip will affect the results of the elections there if it will not affect the results we might no longer call for special elections there
3106411 nothing is perfect but replacement machines are readily available there are 1 5 million voters in the armm and if some 1 000 voters for instance were not able to vote i hope that it wont be the one highlighted in the media its only a small percentage
3106412 this is one way of stopping saboteurs coming near the highways and the polling sites
3106413 reports disclosed that the milf rebels were trying to block the comelec team and tried to confiscate the election paraphernalia to stop the conduct of the election
3106414 while it is true we oppose the holding of the election the protest is only to postpone the election on the assumption it will affect the peace talks if and when the memorandum on agreement on ancestral domain signing will push through
3106415 the initiatives for reforms in philippine elections whether the initiatives will be coming from the government or private sector must continue and must start right now to ensure that the general elections by 2010 are orderly clean and honest
3106416 we have tightened further the security measures that we have put in place
3106417 true muslims respect worship sites regardless if these belong to christians muslims or people of any other faith
3106418 our sustained aerial and ground bombardments have hit them hard
3106419 ombra kato is a legit commander of the milf who heads the 105th base command he is the legitimate commander he does not lead a lost command as reported
3106420 there is always such a possibility because a tactical alliance has always been existing in their efforts to topple the government
3106421 but in terms of ideology the milf and the npa have different beliefs
3106422 most probable also is these rebels would be bombing transmission lines
3106423 my instruction is to closely guard these installations and watch the activities of these people
3106424 we deployed rangers and regular army combatants in hills along the highways for them to immediately take out any armed group that would attempt to disrupt the conduct of elections in isolated areas
3106425 my appeal to both sides the government and the milif is that they should be generous to each other in order to attain peace
3106426 the peace should come from their hearts so there would be peace in the affected areas because they are the ones who suffer the poor people are the ones being dislocated from their homes because of the ongoing attack
3106427 but not unique in world football for example a similar situation has existed in italy where ac milan and inter milan share the same san siro stadium as a home venue and lazio and roma likewise both play their home games at the olympic stadium in rome
3106428 the draw decided whether sundowns or supersport were technically classified as the home team this saturday
3106429 and which team would be categorised as the home team for the second leg
3106430 whereby the two teams finish up with the same aggregate of goals on what is effectively their home ground after both matches but because one team would have scored more times on what was designated an away game by the draw they would go through to the final
3106431 playing in holland is ideal because the team has the opportunity to play the sport we all love in a country where it is fully embraced holland has some of the best field hockey teams and club programs in the world the competition will be elite and the matches will be challenging but the opportunity to also interact with local people and european culture will be a rewarding educational and for some a life changing experience
3106432 everyone on the team is so excited to be making this trip
3106433 we are very fortunate and couldnt have asked for a better experience in which we can grow together as a team weve watched youtube videos of field hockey from the netherlands so we know they will be very good i believe this opportunity will make us stronger and allow us to be more successful later this season
3106434 that experience to the third world country of jamaica was eye opening and life altering
3106435 this is my first time going to europe and i anticipate a different but yet similar experience for myself and the others
3106436 the team this year is a special group and the timing is right the time the team spends abroad will provide the players with an opportunity to bond and make us stronger as a team
3106437 the team will definitely be battle tested by the start of the regular season
3106438 the seniors have been fundraising since the end of their freshman year
3106439 theyve raised funds through activities such as goalathon solicitations jewelry sales and acquiring donations from parents and friends of the program the teams hard work over the past three years definitely helps to offset some of the costs of the trip
3106440 the day started as early as 4 30 a m to milk the cows
3106441 over the weekend the players experienced a different life and i think it reinforced what we can do for others and become better people
3106442 hartwick is a place that provides so many opportunities whether that means being part of a great academic program like nursing or belonging to an athletic team club or organization where you can connect and develop lifelong friendships
3106443 being a part of this field hockey program is like a family experience and what ive learned and experienced as a member of this team will benefit me in every sense of my life after hartwick
3106444 during the last credit crisis the stocks hit bottom in november 1990 and the losses and nonperforming assets didnt peak until well into 1991
3106445 every cycle theres one analyst who races to be the most bearish and this time its her honestly i think well look back and see that meredith whitneys credibility peaked on july 15
3106446 morgan stanley made a fortune buying written down commercial real estate assets from banks at 40 cents on the dollar
3106447 the only explanation i can see is she has no idea how to evaluate the possible downside risks
3106448 because i was rumored to be in a deal for mark teixeira so when i just told them they all thought i was messing with them
3106449 would you like to sit on the porch or would you rather live
3106450 the lagged effect of interest rate increases growing pressure on consumers as a result of sharp increases in inflation especially energy and food will reinforce the negative trend
3106451 compared to the 36 475 positions at the end of the first quarter of 2008 aggregate industry employment declined by 416 jobs during the second quarter of 2008 to 36 059 jobs
3106452 we thank the swiss government not only for the values of freedom and civil rights that are enshrined in its culture but also for its willingness to share its experience in federalism through the institute of federalism located in freebord in switzerland which has been helping us do our studies on this form of government
3106453 we advocate federalism as a way to ensure long lasting peace in mindanao
3106454 this may sound new but she has announced this a long time ago that federalism is the way forward
3106455 esperon should stay away from discussions on political structures hes not qualified lets just ask him about the extra judicial killings and forced disappearances maybe he can help but about the peace process im very sorry to say that hes not qualified
3106456 i hope nobody uses the milf moa issue to advance something that has long been ignored by the people
3106457 the mere mention of cha cha raises public suspicion that politicians and the government are up to something
3106458 i dont think any person can demand that congress prioritizes cha cha to be able to have peace in mindanao
3106459 esperons statement on cha cha and the highly suspect moves of government negotiators only expose how out of touch with reality our government is when it comes to the fate of this controversial peace pact
3106460 if they think that the people will readily swallow the garbage they will serve then they are wrong ignoring the sentiments of our citizens in the said peace pact will be the very reason this endeavor will not prosper
3106461 we already saw what can happen when we railroad cha cha the people are vigilant and they will not take a matter this serious sitting down
3106462 if government is really sincere in bringing peace all over the philippines then it must not put first selfish interests before the welfare of this nation
3106463 muslim filipinos our brothers have the right to plot their destiny within the framework of the philippine constitution
3106464 are not denied their rightful share of the fruits of national development
3106465 it is our constitutional duty to ensure the rights and well being of our muslim brothers
3106466 must establish the criteria for allocating additional resources for education economic and cultural development programs
3106467 it also has the function of advising the president in the formulation coordination implementation and monitoring of policies plans programs and projects affecting muslim filipino communities
3106468 it would also act as the primary government agency through which muslim filipinos can seek government assistance and redress and serve as medium through which such assistance may be extended to muslim filipinos
3106469 j e regrette profond ment que le pr sident de la r publique malgache ne mait pas accord la moindre chance de pouvoir accomplir lexaltante mission dont je r vais depuis longtemps

3106472 im not sure that anybody can legitimately say that mccain is conservative
3106473 while many cities and counties have their adopted budgets online its refreshing to see collin county take the initiative to become the first county in america to open its financial data to the taxpayers
3106474 by creating this level of transparency collin county is forging a true partnership with its citizens
3106475 this adds an important new dimension to open government for our citizens
3106476 providing our taxpayers with up to date easily understandable information not only brings accountability but goes a long way to ensuring public trust in how we spend their tax dollars for local services
3106477 collin county has shown the path forward to more accessible and accountable county government
3106478 we call on the other 253 texas counties to follow their lead and open their own financial books to the public
3106479 nah if we need to talk then id rather get it out of the way sooner than later
3106480 adventure based 3d virtual worlds for young children has raised 5 million in series b funding round led by azure capital and telesoft partners
3106481 will be a catalyst for knowledge adventure to further broaden from a cd rom based educational software company to a multi faceted kids entertainment company that maintains long term relationships with users

3106485 sampling frequency should be at least five to ten times as high as the highest frequency component of the signal
3106486 es una lata porque tuvimos muchas m s posibilidades nosotros en el primer set pero creo que ellos jugaron muy bien sus puntos importantes
3106487 llegamos al tiebreak que se definen por muy poco despu s hubo solamente un quiebre que nos cost el segundo set creo que nosotros merec amos haber ganado el primer set pero las cosas aqu se ganan no se merecen
3106488 obvio que nos habr a gustado ganar pero perder es parte de esto ahora nos quedan los individuales y hay jugarse por entero
3106489 nos conocemos hace mucho creo que jugamos bastante bien y nos sentimos c modos pero bueno al frente ten amos a dos grandes rivales
3106490 as es el tenis a veces se gana y a veces se pierde no hay m s
3106491 fue un partido muy apretado muy dif cil de muy buen nivel y que se decidi en dos o tres puntos pero me queda una sensaci n de que les falt un poquito de suerte porque tuvieron 12 puntos de quiebre en el primer set
3106492 ciertamente que tampoco hay que restarles m rito a los rusos porque se equivocaron muy poco
3106493 siempre dije que el primer partido era clave fernando y nicol s hubiesen tomado mucho m s confianza si hubiesen ganado este partido pero les toc uno de los cuadros m s dif ciles lo cierto es que en los momentos importantes los rusos no fallaron y por ah pas el partido
3106494 creo que frente a una situaci n que puede ser absolutamente coyuntural intentar aprovecharse haciendo anuncios de alzas que son aparentemente inevitables a nosotros nos parece imprudente porque finalmente eso atenta contra ellos y hay otras opciones que yo espero que los consumidores puedan empezar a usar
3106495 el a o pasado la importaci n de carne paraguaya estaba alrededor de 3 500 d lares la tonelada y esa misma carne hoy d a traerla vale 7 500 la tonelada por ning n lado se ve la posibilidad de que los precios bajen
3106496 cu nto van a subir de aqu al 18 de septiembre no me atrever a a decir yo creo que estos precios al menos se van a mantener
3106497 sexual orientation is a small part of a person i cannot see why a person should be reduced to sexual orientation
3106498 people should be made aware that we are also human beings with feelings
3106499 it does not only service the government there but also the ordinary zimbabweans

3106502 advanced weapons havent been able to defeat the insurgents in iraq have they why dont you go talk to anyone with a military background and ask them how difficult it is to defeat a determined guerrilla enemy especially in a urban environment
3106503 mr mccain has made a number of verbal gaffes in recent months including referring three times to czechoslovakia a country that has not existed since 1993
3106504 if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row then im not sharp

3106806 be brave master ridley and play the man we shall this day by the grace of god light such a candle in as i trust shall never be put out

3106912 let the press do its job even when that might sting
3106913 i would submit that a president who is unable to learn from his or her own mistakes and then to articulate for a curious public what he or she has learned is not prepared for that office
3106914 banished himself to the ignominious position of worst united states president ever
3106915 built much of its program around a basic commitment to lying

3106930 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3106931 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3106932 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous

3106934 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3106935 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3106936 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3106937 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3106938 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3106939 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3106940 does anyone believe that it is possible to win the nomination without over these next two months raising all these issues on him wont a single tape of the reverend jeremiah wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender

3106948 das liegt daran dass wir nur f nf mal im klagenfurter hallenbad trainieren k nnen zwei einheiten kommen bei zluga bers sport borg dazu fehlen noch immer zwei trainingseinheiten pro woche
3106949 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
3106950 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
3106951 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3106952 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3106953 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3106954 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3106955 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3106956 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3106957 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3106958 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3106959 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3106960 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3106961 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3106962 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3106963 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3106964 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3106965 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3106966 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3106967 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3106968 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3106969 its very hard to tell your banker that hes wrong
3106970 ever wonder what washington has done with your tax dollars this olympics is your chance to find out for the last 8 years the bush administration has been paying china billions of dollars in interest on the trillions it borrowed for tax breaks pork and special privileges you never got that money helped create thousands of businesses and millions of jobs in china so as you enjoy the games keep an eye on your tax dollars at work the way our economys going its tough to pay your bills but take heart you already paid chinas
3106971 youre looking forward now to a much different life for yourself
3106972 there are some one way conversations going on cause ive said i cant talk but i certainly can listen
3106973 the thing thats important for someone with my experience to talk about is the state of politics in washington
3106974 its created what i call a extremely dysfunctional hyperpartisan senate were getting little to nothing done
3106975 could romney be planning to establish residency in california with an eye on the governors seat gov schwarzenegger is forced out by term limits in 2010 stay tuned
3106976 governor romney has been looking at property on the west coast because he has family in california and because his wife ann spends a good deal of time there riding horses
3106977 the number of deviant offenders a community can afford to recognize is likely to remain stable over time
3106978 malta is not an obvious place for a love affair to flourish not unlike staten island it tends to be a conservative place
3106979 word about the affair spread and republican officials soon became concerned fearing it would be exposed sources said
3106980 a pattern of conduct was exhibited among many individuals to remain willfully ignorant
3106981 i lost confidence in her and im not going to kid you
3106982 i was also concerned with this other relationship thing it didnt look like it should
3106983 at least 70 frivolous duplicative and repetitive actions in this court
3106984 by the time the order was issued that number had reached 82
3106985 the government can operate on its own self produced money
3106986 all superdelegates should save their endorsements for candidates with a real shot
3106987 when it comes to national security any big dog should think twice before agreeing to a long journey with mitt romney
3106988 a small varmint gun totin civil rights marching nra endorsed fantasy candidate
3106989 its one thing to campaign for my dad someone whose principles i line up with almost entirely
3106990 in this time of war i simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror
3106991 we cannot allow the next president of the united states to retreat in the face of evil extremism
3106992 as a lifelong hunter i didnt want to miss the start of varmint season
3106993 its tenacious coverage of the twists and turns in the scandal involving the states senator larry craig
3106994 this was news to most idaho voters who have viewed the whole affair with shock outrage embarrassment and dismay but craig didnt stop there
3106995 i know ill love it because clean air clean water and many many many mountains
3106996 my heart my mind my body my soul my thoughts are in this to win
3106997 if i save one babys life it will be worth it
3106998 voters are casting a vote for a person and not a political proposition
3106999 the people that vote for me are more intelligent than to have something defined in legislation like this
3107000 the pirates are not in a rebuilding mode were in a building mode
3107001 trolling for sex in a mens room doesnt logically require that you support gay marriage
3107002 over the course of my public life i have insisted i believe correctly that people regardless of their position or power take responsibility for their conduct i can and will ask no less of myself
3107003 its one thing to campaign for my dad someone whose principles i line up with almost entirely
3107004 youve got this built in campaign team with your sons
3107005 to discuss the former massachusetts governor becoming the face of conservatism
3107006 was it for this that all that blood was shed
3107007 if someone had suggested a year ago and a half ago that we would be welcoming mitt romney as a potential leader of the conservative movement no one would have believed it
3107008 but over the last year and a half he has convinced us he is one of us and walks with us
3107009 you could tell everybody at the table sitting with romney was asking himself is he the one
3107010 i sampled all of the alaskan classics moose salmon and whale oh so good
3107011 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3107012 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3107013 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3107014 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3107015 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3107016 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3107017 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3107018 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3107019 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3107020 our partnership with nbc for the 2008 beijing olympics is a tremendous opportunity for rodale to offer its authoritative and trusted content in running and cycling to online viewers across the united states and the world
3107021 all eyes will be on beijing in august and we are so pleased that nbc recognizes rodale
3107022 through our coverage of the beijing olympic games it is our goal to provide our audience with a next generation online experience that encapsulates the storytelling and analysis nbc olympics is known for providing rodale
3107023 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3107024 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3107025 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3107026 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3107027 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3107028 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3107029 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3107030 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3107031 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3107032 president obama and a democratic congress will likely dole out entitlements like free health care child care and cash payments to anyone who falls under a certain income level that means that people who drink gin all day long will be getting some of my hard earned money folks who dropped out of school who are too lazy to hold a job and who smoke reefer 24 7 will all get some goodies in the mail from uncle barack and aunt nancy
3107033 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3107034 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3107035 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3107036 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3107037 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3107038 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3107039 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3107040 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3107041 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3107042 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3107043 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3107044 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3107045 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3107046 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3107047 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3107048 this is stuff you see other people do and you think thatd be awesome
3107049 i was an extra in the surrogates with bruce willis
3107050 i was in the background in a beauty shop scene
3107051 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3107052 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3107053 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3107054 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3107055 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3107056 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3107057 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3107058 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3107059 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3107060 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3107061 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3107062 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3107063 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3107064 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3107065 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3107066 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3107067 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
3107068 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
3107069 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
3107070 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
3107071 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
3107072 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
3107073 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3107074 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3107075 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
3107076 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
3107077 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3107078 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3107079 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
3107080 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3107081 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3107082 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3107083 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3107084 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3107085 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3107086 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3107087 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3107088 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3107089 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
3107090 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3107091 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3107092 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3107093 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3107094 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3107095 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
3107096 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3107097 we had no choice but to protect our civilians and restore our constitutional order
3107098 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
3107099 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
3107100 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3107101 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3107102 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3107103 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3107104 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3107105 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3107106 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3107107 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3107108 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3107109 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3107110 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3107111 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3107112 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3107113 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3107114 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3107115 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3107116 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3107117 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3107118 just so you all know we did set a record
3107119 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3107120 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3107121 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3107122 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3107123 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3107124 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3107125 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3107126 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3107127 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3107128 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3107129 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3107130 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3107131 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3107132 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3107133 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3107134 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3107135 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3107136 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3107137 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3107138 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3107139 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3107140 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3107141 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
3107142 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
3107143 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
3107144 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
3107145 whats happening is that flooding events are all of a sudden not being labeled 50 year floods anymore
3107146 prior to that i hadnt heard anybody talking about it in the community
3107147 its more something you think that older people should take care of for us
3107148 ive been going there for several years and the place has changed including the service and the food and not for the better im
3107149 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3107150 that democrats are united around a commitment to provide every american access to affordable comprehensive health care
3107151 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3107152 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3107153 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
3107154 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
3107155 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
3107156 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
3107157 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
3107158 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3107159 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
3107160 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3107161 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
3107162 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
3107163 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
3107164 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3107165 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
3107166 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
3107167 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
3107168 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3107169 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
3107170 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
3107171 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3107172 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
3107173 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3107174 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3107175 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3107176 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3107177 nobody wants to be in a sinking ship they want to be on the right side at this crucial moment
3107178 we remain close allies in the war on terror and will continue our close ties with the democratically elected government of pakistan
3107179 i took the risk and came out of twice bombed mamund because even though we were spared in the bombing we may starve as no supply is coming up there
3107180 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3107181 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3107182 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3107183 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3107184 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3107185 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3107186 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3107187 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3107188 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3107189 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3107190 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3107191 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3107192 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3107193 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3107194 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3107195 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3107196 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
3107197 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
3107198 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
3107199 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
3107200 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
3107201 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
3107202 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3107203 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3107204 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3107205 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3107206 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
3107207 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
3107208 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
3107209 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
3107210 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
3107211 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
3107212 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
3107213 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3107214 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3107215 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3107216 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3107217 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3107218 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3107219 he advocates the full repeal of doma which goes farther than hillary clinton who only recommended repealing part of the defense of marriage act
3107220 hes talking about opening up the military to homosexuality in a time of war hes talking about gay adoption putting children in homes that are intentionally fatherless or intentionally motherless and using the white house bully pulpit to do that
3107221 that makes obama the first presidential candidate to actually support homosexual marriage when youre congratulating homosexuals for their supposed marriage thats being for and celebrating homosexual marriage
3107222 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3107223 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3107224 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3107225 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3107226 this bill requires the governor to proclaim may 22 as harvey milk day the designation of a day of significance triggers statutory encouragement for public schools to observe and conduct commemorative exercises suitable to the day
3107227 this bad bill will teach impressionable schoolchildren the anti religious homosexual bisexual transsexual agenda of harvey milk
3107228 if signed into law ab 2567 will mean an official day commemorating homosexuality bisexuality and transsexuality in california government schools this will harm children as young as kindergarten
3107229 the democrats are so cocky they have no qualms about pushing sexual indoctrination upon children in an election year for the love of god parents and their children we implore governor schwarzenegger to veto ab 2567
3107230 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do
3107231 this is a team that lost nine straight its ok to go out and try to win some preseason games and get some confidence marty schottenheimer was coming back to resurrect our pathetic team instead the coach with the most boring speaking delivery in the history of football will be doing radio ugh
3107232 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3107233 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film
3107234 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3107235 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3107236 i think the clincher here will be when you tell her you actually own bibles and simply just dont rent them girls tend to like a man of means
3107237 i think the clincher here will be when you tell her you actually own bibles and simply just dont rent them girls tend to like a man of means
3107238 dia moreno sudah cukup tahu apa yang akan dia lakukan
3107239 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3107240 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3107241 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3107242 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
3107243 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
3107244 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
3107245 even if he makes a marginal improvement with that huge group of voters that could ultimately be very important in certain swing states like my state of virginia where evangelicals comprise a large portion of the voters
3107246 many will either sit on their hands on election day or even if they vote for mccain they wont be out there mobilizing the base and doing the hard work that these folks have done in the past for the republican party
3107247 there are some data that young evangelicals are focusing on a variety of issues not just the social issues but i dont see a voting shift taking place just because younger folks care about the environment doesnt mean thats going to trump their concerns about the life issues
3107248 thats the minimal step he has to take to reduce the animosity against him on abortion
3107249 and if he doesnt do even that hes basically kissing goodbye the chances of making deep inroads in the white evangelical vote
3107250 he has got to come out forcibly and talk about reducing abortions in america he has to forcibly come out and talk about education and abstinence programs
3107251 we evangelicals have to face the fact that when we speak on this issue we in the church do not have enough authority to convince people of that position and have to resort to the coercion of the law
3107252 we have lost our moral authority in this society we havent been able to impact our own community to the extent that we should
3107253 explain to me how you can live with your conscience and sleep at night
3107254 why emulate the failures of american education as opposed to the successes of european education
3107255 they could be if canadian policy makers like you did their jobs correctly
3107256 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
3107257 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3107258 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
3107259 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3107260 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3107261 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3107262 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3107263 because he bainimarama did not agree to support the sdls agenda
3107264 in all there were about 14 16 attempts to remove the commander
3107265 at that time there were some renegade officers who actually stood against the commander and actually rebelled there were officers who tried to remove the commander and take up appointment as commander when the commander was away
3107266 it was a rude awakening when they suddenly realized that the army stood by the commander and was united
3107267 we are confident in saying that the military is 100 percent behind the commander the commander has the full support of all the officers and soldiers in the camp we are all together and in support of the vision of what military represents we all support what the president has mandated
3107268 but there were elements within our society and within the government circle at that time who had other intentions
3107269 in 2000 we were quite vocal in terms of prosecuting individuals who tried to destabilize the society
3107270 we started telling political parties not to bring in an agenda which basically undermined the society
3107271 but the introduction of the qoliqoli and many other bills were not in the best interest of the country
3107272 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
3107273 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
3107274 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
3107275 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
3107276 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
3107277 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
3107278 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
3107279 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
3107280 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
3107281 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
3107282 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
3107283 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3107284 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3107285 the survey shows religion in america is indeed 3 000 miles wide and only three inches deep
3107286 theres a growing pluralistic impulse toward tolerance and that is having theological consequences
3107287 what most people are saying is hey we dont have a hammer lock on god or salvation and gods bigger than us and we should respect that and respect other people
3107288 some people are like butterflies that go from flower to flower going from religion to religion
3107289 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3107290 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3107291 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3107292 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3107293 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3107294 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3107295 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3107296 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3107297 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3107298 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3107299 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3107300 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3107301 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3107302 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3107303 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3107304 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3107305 la belleza muere con el tiempo en el arte es eterna
3107306 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie
3107307 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
3107308 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3107309 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3107310 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3107311 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
3107312 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3107313 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3107314 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3107315 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3107316 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3107317 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3107318 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3107319 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3107320 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3107321 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3107322 i am pleased to inform you that this report is false
3107323 it is merely a rumour started by someone who obviously is miserable in their own skin that they would even have the notion to attack a child
3107324 rest assured reginae is tucked away in her bed at this very moment trying to get past the hurt this ugliness has caused her and our family
3107325 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3107326 wir haben deshalb eine sachverhaltsdarstellung an die staatsanwaltschaft leoben geschickt
3107327 when i get a chance to play golf or go on a boat with good people take the boat out and put some lobsters on the grill get the ice cold beer and the cigars thats heaven on earth
3107328 facciamo il gioco del mimo noi si fa quello che fate voi ok

3107330 oh bastardo vieni gi va che si va a prende il granoo
3107331 reducir el n mero de despidos porque 1 200 es una cifra excesiva
3107332 es absurdo aplicar un ere si a la compa a le quedan pocos meses de vida
3107333 queremos saber si el plan de viabilidad es real o s lo una excusa para hacer un ere
3107334 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3107335 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3107336 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3107337 it would be unfair to consumers with accounts at other firms and well as to the firms that settled if our investigation were to slow down or stop accordingly our investigations focus is shifting to the next group of market participants
3107338 ich war von meiner arbeit aus immer unterwegs um meine finanziellen angelegenheiten hat sich meine frau gek mmert
3107339 sie geben ein verm gensverzeichnis ab weil mit exekutionen nichts mehr bei ihnen zu holen ist und im selben monat ziehen sie in ein neues haus ein
3107340 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3107341 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3107342 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3107343 russia is a nuclear state they are very close to this region and we are very far away
3107344 detaining this criminal leader will enhance security and stability for the people of baghdad
3107345 with him behind bars progress and improvements of essential services in the areas where he conducted his crimes can proceed with greater ease
3107346 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3107347 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3107348 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3107349 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3107350 we signed a plan saying that the status quo ante is to be restored
3107351 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3107352 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3107353 we are trying to stop this as soon as possible
3107354 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3107355 we have to go to the shelter because there are russian planes flying over the presidential palace here sorry
3107356 at the moment our troops are pushing out capturing and disarming groups of georgian law enforcement agencies which have been surrounded in the capital of south ossetia
3107357 the 1992 treaty which georgia signed among others clearly defines the limits of responsibility of the russian peacekeeping contingent and is doesnt have any tasks of invading the georgian territory
3107358 inflicted damage on operational systems troops and military facilities of georgia
3107359 overnight as many as 50 russian bombers were reported operating simultaneously over georgia targeting civilian populations in cities and villages as well as radio and telecommunications sites
3107360 during their mop up operations in south ossetia georgian commandos have thrown hand grenades into the basements where civilians were hiding
3107361 i wish to extend my sincerest sympathies to bob leeks family its so easy to criticize but we should recognize the great work of everyone who responded to this devastating event
3107362 i was within 10km of the incident and it was truly terrifying even from a safe distance
3107363 my heart goes out to the employee and firefighter killed in this accident it is fortunate that not more people got injured or killed
3107364 hear the thunder hear our roar its not over til its under
3107365 you cant see anything but its very romantic and sexy
3107366 i would love to find my boy teddy john of mtvs 8th amp ocean fame somewhere in this darkness he went to get red wine
3107367 it was 1956 the year of sadness the year of mourning and one man took heart on one lone horse and in an instance just as the glare of the sun had hit him previously he was struck by the what he felt for this creature
3107368 in the eyes of the horse he saw the suffering of all mankind and he had no choice but one choice to reach out and save one lone creature from the fate of suffering and murder when we make the only choice possible and that is to love then all of us become what we were intended to be we are the power
3107369 all they want to do is arrest somebody and get on tv
3107370 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3107371 theyre both good kids and they do a great job
3107372 console gamers young heavy gamers and extreme gamers are more likely to use consoles than a pc to play video games
3107373 i was feeling not good my condition was not 100 percent but he was a good player today wong choong hann
3107374 i was concentrating very hard because i didnt want to lose like i did in athens
3107375 there is too much pressure great pressure but my personal target is a medal of any colour
3107376 for the first few points i was bit nervous but after winning the first game i had much more confidence although maybe i made some simple mistakes
3107377 he is the only player that nobody wanted to meet he is by far the toughest draw to get when i say the draw i thought this is very unlucky
3107378 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3107379 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3107380 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3107381 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3107382 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3107383 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3107384 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3107385 while there are still opportunities for improvement the panels finding concluded that nasa is making significant progress in improving safety issues during the past year
3107386 the asap commends the constellation program for endorsing the recommendation of the asap and continuing to employ early hazard and risk analysis
3107387 i am pleased to inform you that this report is false
3107388 it is merely a rumour started by someone who obviously is miserable in their own skin that they would even have the notion to attack a child
3107389 an artificial appropriation of different styles from different eras the hipster represents the end
3107390 school staff and officers from the county council focused on putting plans in place for st felix pupils and staff for the start of term met on friday 8 august and continue to work with local schools to finalise arrangements

3107439 certainly not every abortion leads to domestic violence nor is every case of domestic violence rooted in the trauma of a prior abortion but it is not a coincidence that the rates of abortion and domestic violence have risen together during the last twenty five years the evidence supporting a correlation between abortion and violence between women and men at least for some couples is so compelling that it is beyond dispute
3107440 perhaps the two key elements related to post abortion violence are 1 increased levels of irritability anger and rage and 2 increased tendencies toward risk taking self destructive and suicidal behaviors
3107441 self hatred hatred of the male and hatred of men in general were all significantly correlated to each other
3107442 this constellation of problems an increased tendency toward violence emotional detachment and self destructive behaviors would appear to be exasperated by the study groups dramatically increased rate of drug and alcohol abuse subsequent to abortion
3107443 cycles of violence such as this are common studies of domestic abuse have found that women are substantially more likely to initiate violence then men as confirmed even by the women studied because of their greater strength however the hitting done by men causes more damage but researchers have also found that to offset this advantage of strength women are more likely to resort to the use of household weapons such as boiling water or knives

3107457 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3107458 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3107459 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3107460 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3107461 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3107462 this study identifies superior leadership based on the success of hospital executive teams long term strategies for strengthening performance

3107464 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3107465 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3107466 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3107496 steve radelet of the center for global development sees a total change in washingtons attitude about development aid and hes hoping this will translate into some real reform the way we are organized to deliver foreign assistance and to invest in low income countries is really quite behind the times he said our apparatus was set up in the early 60s the legislation is the foreign assistance act of 1961 passed in the early days of the kennedy administration the center put together a video to show how development needs have changed noting that when kennedy signed the act it was meant to provide military assistance to countries on the rim of the communist world

3107610 do i believe i can improve as a player yes

3107613 you cant ask much more out of him right now for what he does he keeps making plays
3107614 it would be great to get a guy like watkins or a guy like rookie wide receiver chaz schilens if they were able to make the team
3107615 they both are guys that can contribute on special teams
3107616 i didnt know where i was going to be after each year whether i was going to sign with that team or if i was going to move on
3107617 but now im extremely excited i have a great opportunity on a team that is on the rise this team has great potential and im excited to hopefully be a part of it
3107618 it feels good to come out here and practice and hear the fans go oooh ahhh with the big catches interceptions and big hits
3107619 it just gives you energy for practice and we enjoy that
3107620 its just good to relate with the fans because lets face it weve been terrible the last five years and for them to still come out and support us the way they do my hats off to them

3107639 organs from executed prisoners are being offered for up to 300 000 each to hong kong liver transplant patients who travel to a mainland hospital
3107640 the organs are of good quality as they come from executed prisoners

3107642 90 of organs used for transplant in china come from condemned prisoners
3107643 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy

3107645 we the government should own the refineries then we can control how much gets into the market

3107647 there is no question these windfall profits and income created by the bush administration need to be taxed at 100 rate and those dollars redistributed to the poor and working class

3107650 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3107651 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3107652 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3107653 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3107654 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3107655 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3107656 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3107657 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3107658 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3107659 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3107660 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3107661 believe as i do or you will go to hell
3107662 i draw from the christian faith on the other hand i was born in hawaii where obviously there are a lot of eastern influences i lived in indonesia the largest muslim country in the world between the ages of six and 10 my father was from kenya and although he was probably most accurately labeled an agnostic his father was muslim and id say probably intellectually ive drawn as much from judaism as any other faith
3107663 i was raised more by my mother and my mother was christian
3107664 my grandparents who were from small towns in kansas my grandmother was methodist my grandfather was baptist this was at a time when i think the methodists felt slightly superior to the baptists and by the time i was born they were i think my grandparents had joined a universalist church
3107665 so my mother who i think had as much influence on my values as anybody was not someone who wore her religion on her sleeve wed go to church for easter she wasnt a church lady
3107666 i probably didnt get started getting active in church activities until i moved to chicago
3107667 so that one of the churches i met or one of the churches that i became involved in was trinity united church of christ and the pastor there jeremiah wright became a good friend so i joined that church and committed myself to christ in that church
3107668 well my pastor is certainly someone who i have an enormous amount of respect for i have a number of friends who are ministers reverend meeks is a close friend and colleague of mine in the state senate father michael pfleger is a dear friend and somebody i interact with closely
3107669 and theyre good friends because both of them are in the public eye there are ways we can all reflect on whats happening to each of us in ways that are useful
3107670 which is why you generally will not see me spending a lot of time talking about it on the stump
3107671 as i said before in my own public policy im very suspicious of religious certainty expressing itself in politics
3107672 i think it was just a moment to certify or publicly affirm a growing faith in me
3107673 the high pressure causes oil to continuously seep up along fissures in the earths crust into subterranean caverns which we call oil fields oil is still being produced in great abundance and is a sustainable resource by the same definition that makes geothermal energy a sustainable resource
3107674 running out of oil and must wean ourselves off of it
3107675 it is my fervent wish that military actions cease immediately
3107676 refrain also in the name of a common christian heritage from further confrontations and violent retaliations that could degenerate into a wider conflict
3107677 i also invite the international community and the countries most influential in the current situation to make every effort to sustain and promote initiatives aimed at reaching a peaceful and lasting solution one which favors open and respectful coexistence

3107679 it must be centuries ago that i did my last tour
3107680 many many years ago i stopped doing shows at age 66 its not advisable to get back on the stage but the organizers managers and other artists involved particularly aishwarya were very keen that i come along
3107681 what we do onstage is a reproduction of what we do on film so obviously music dancing and singing are an integral part
3107682 but well also sing along and recite some dialogue from the films and interact with the audience
3107683 i think we all grew up hearing songs from amitabh bachchan movies in the car with our parents growing up and film music and copying the movies choreographed dancing is really popular at indo pak weddings
3107684 that industry is a big part of our lives so i guess this show is a really big deal especially because who knows if amitabh will ever tour again
3107685 i thought of that 20 years ago and im back so one never knows im just thankful people still consider me a performer its very gratifying
3107686 appearing before a live audience is always a frightening experience there are butterflies and nervousness
3107687 but once youre there and you hear the crowds roaring and screaming out for you all you want to do is please them
3107688 abhishek and aishwarya have been called the brangelina of bollywood and amitabh is probably even more revered there than someone legendary like
3107689 for immediate and confidential consideration please apply to this online posting
3107690 i guess its bittersweet you spend half your life trying to become larger than life and the other half trying to just live a real life again

3107765 our evidence suggests that the key factor is being outdoors and that it does not matter if that time is spent in having a picnic or in playing sport

3107767 we have not yet established why being outside is protective

3107810 its now been 10 days since speaker pelosi shut down the house of representatives shut down debate turned off the lights turned off the mikes and turned off the cameras without addressing the number one issue that confronts americans today
3107811 we come back to washington today once again to give voice to the american people to say that theres a common sense solution and a simple solution and that is the american energy act
3107812 it increases conservation increases alternative fuel sources and enhances and increases the ability to get domestic american oil supply
3107813 there is a national crisis in healthcare and at the same time contract labor spending is exploding to 10 billion
3107814 providing high quality patient care while managing labor costs against a background of increasing transparency and declining reimbursements is a critical challenge
3107815 i was just trying to get on base to be honest with you to get david ortiz up with a chance to tie the game
3107816 i ended up getting a good pitch to hit and hit it that was basically it
3107817 papi knows when the ball is gone but i guess mother nature doesnt want me to hit it out tonight the wind was blowing really hard tonight
3107818 oha du musst jetzt viel trinken m glichst kr utertee mit honig
3107819 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site versus ebays starts from an incorrect basis
3107820 based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites
3107821 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue
3107822 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise
3107823 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting
3107824 in view of recent international developments the risks associated with highly leveraged borrowings and reliance on short term funds by some nbfcs to fund long gestation assets concerns have arisen regarding the enhanced systemic risk
3107825 are not into such risky business and their loans are generally very small
3107826 leading to commercialisation of microfinance which again makes it an expensive exercise and leads to higher rates
3107827 how do we drive traffic in a really slow environment
3107828 ivan has a wealth of experience having played at the highest level for many years and he can be a great asset for us
3107829 he won the league and the cup and it would be irresponsible to replace shum to improve we need to add another experienced man who will work together with him
3107830 its not a bike its what he uses instead of a wheelchair
3107831 it has two wheels it must be classified as a bike
3107832 it is his mobility device and you should respect it
3107833 hes got a cane he can walk just fine get it out of here
3107834 theres more people than you on this bus you have to respect everyone
3107835 that aint no f cken wheelchair thats some petty sh t that he gets special priveleges
3107836 the last few days hes made some long throws and got a little achy yesterday i dont see any reason why he wouldnt be able to play tomorrow
3107837 its a combination im not going to say were moving mclouth out of the three hole
3107838 certain days the way our lineup looks like today he fits better in the lead we know he can lead off and hes had a lot of success lately when i sit down and look at the lineup see how it best looks the balance of it today right or wrong it looked better to have him lead off
3107839 the last thing was to make sure he was swinging a lot looks fine hitting just being able to grip the ball to where he can throw it across the field he went out early and did that he said he felt it but he was good enough to be able to play
3107840 faas claim that it can use its property management authority to auction slots is intellectually dishonest and a disturbing end run around congress
3107841 every transportation administration except this one has acknowledged that it does not have the authority to implement auctions and other so called market mechanisms yet this administration believes it can ignore the statutory limits of its authority to remake the industry as it sees fit
3107842 should be held unlawful and set aside because these actions are in excess of the faas statutory authority constitute unauthorized regulatory action disguised as property management are contrary to express statutory limitations imposed by congress in the 2008 consolidated appropriations act are without observance of procedure required by law and are arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion and otherwise not in accordance with law
3107843 we think that if we increase the fines it will make people think twice before dumping their boats
3107844 boats are not like cars where you can basically sell a junky car for parts
3107845 it probably costs 3 000 to have a boat properly removed
3107846 and a lot of people getting rid of a boat is doing it because of a money situation
3107847 when was the last time you were around gerritsen creek
3107848 we find boats along the shoreline or in the water sticking out at low tide and even with sonars
3107849 i live near this area and i just want to keep this place clean
3107850 agencies and individuals have taken action to preserve the environment for future generations
3107851 the congressmans recognition represents an important milestone in the success of
3107852 jamaica bay ought to be a place of refuge for residents
3107853 not a junkyard for abandoned boats pulling these boat wrecks out of the bay is a giant step toward keeping our waterways clean
3107854 i read the ticket and looked around to see what i did wrong but i didnt see any hydrant
3107855 this is an unfair ticket and its just another example of the city taking advantage of hardworking residents
3107856 the location of the hydrant was verified by my office although there is no way to know for sure where he was parked at the time the information on the ticket is incorrect and should be revoked
3107857 evidently no one in your department wants to do their job and prefers to act as 185 prostitutes
3107858 its not about the money im just making a stand for everyone who sits back and takes it
3107859 and if he doesnt know something he reads about it
3107860 he should have paid the ticket and then appealed it
3107861 theres no doubt that unfair tickets are a stain on the city
3107862 everyone knows that theres a ticket quota these cops have to reach
3107863 we need to get someone in office whos willing to do whats right for people
3107864 anyone who thinks john would not rule fairly is wrong
3107865 he is the most honest most forthright and irreproachable man i have ever met and its not just me ask anyone who worked with him
3107866 its amusing that someone like andrew cuomo is the person they are asking to replace a man like john
3107867 when i was dean at cardozo law school he was dean at fordham all i can say of the man is that he is a splendid individual
3107868 after working with dean feerick to build confidence in the judiciary ive known him to be a fair minded man
3107869 when i heard his name announced as chairman of the ethics committee i knew no matter who was being investigated it would be done fairly
3107870 ive meet mr feerick on a couple of occasions and told him that he has a rare opportunity
3107871 he used to come and present the facts as a lawyer now he has to rule on the facts we are going to see how fair and honest he is pretty quickly
3107872 when you have full control of the playing field it opens up some questions
3107873 but it is too soon to tell it would be nice if one branch of government didnt rule completely over this situation and it was more nonpartisan
3107874 unless you want to have a board of people who have no interest in politics youll have some members who have made contributions in the past
3107875 i think we are going to ask attorney general andrew cuomo to oversee this one
3107876 i think cuomo although his party affiliation has shown the ability to look into this matter with a fair eye i would like to see his office take the ball
3107877 you dont know you have a finger unless it hurts
3107878 now i get that feeling with regularity its like oh there goes another cyst popping
3107879 here i was the youngest guy from my generation and i was like hey i cant run
3107880 i feel like an idiot holding the whistle and calling penalties
3107881 when i get home from school i basically eat dinner watch the rangers and lie in bed
3107882 it never ceases to amaze me how many people come up to me willing to test and see if theyre a match
3107883 im like wow your giving me a kidney and i dont even know you how someone can be so kind is just amazing
3107884 its the little things you take for granted being healthy but you miss them
3107885 we are out here to make sure that he goes to prison not only for this mortgage scheme but for his years of committing atrocities to the people he was supposed to protect
3107886 lets say a woman goes to sleep and hears a stray cat nudge her window
3107887 she will no longer be able to sleep out of fear someone will break down her door and rape her
3107888 he was a miserable child growing up even as a boy he was known to rape women in the neighborhood
3107889 we just need to make sure that justice is served
3107890 every time a bell rings an angel gets its wings
3107891 the bells used to go off from 9 a m until 9 p m and a parent came up to me and told me she put her kid to sleep at eight so i changed the bell schedule there are some people in the community that want the bells not going to happen
3107892 for a church that is so little it sure makes a lot of noise
3107893 i used to look forward to christmastime when the church would play quiet chimes playing christmas music now i cant bear it anymore im not anti church bell just within reason
3107894 the law handed down by judge gerard denaro states that we could ring the bells whenever we want
3107895 we choose to play the bells from 10 a m to 8 p m if we wanted to there are no limitations
3107896 church bells have been used for centuries it reminds the community that god is present in the community
3107897 i wrote the pastor some letters and he more or less told me to stay out of it
3107898 i have offered my services to be something like a mediator between the two parties involved so we can come to some kind of a solution but for that to happen i need both sides to agree to that meeting
3107899 but im not sure it is a good idea for government to get involved with something religious it would be nice for the two sides to sit down
3107900 we have aa meetings with over 100 years of sobriety between the members so to tell me that the church does nothing for the community other than cause a clamor 77 times a week is just ridiculous
3107901 sometimes i look out my window and see people stop in the street and make the sign of the cross and tell me how beautiful the bells sound
3107902 georgian armed forces received an order to leave gori and to fortify positions near mtskheta to defend the capital this is total onslaught
3107903 the consequences for world security human rights and energy security are tremendous and huge
3107904 i said this violence is unacceptable i was very firm with vladimir putin hopefully this will get resolved peacefully
3107905 do you have a special table so i can lie face down
3107906 and because i can only sleep on my left side
3107907 left side lying is the best sleeping position in pregnancy
3107908 finding that this relatively unimportant topic was increasingly encroaching upon our time with patients we did some research
3107909 in conclusion advising women to sleep or lie exclusively on the left side is not practical and irrelevant to the vast majority of patients
3107910 if lying prone had been detrimental to a normal pregnancy the species would long ago have ceased to exist
3107911 sleeping positions adopted by pregnant women of more than 30 weeks gestation
3107912 each one of you has something no one else has or has ever had your fingerprints your brain your heart be an individual be unique stand out make noise make someone notice thats the power of individuals

3107920 tot nu toe is het zogenaamde nationaliseren van multinationals door de regering van evo morales niet meer dan een mediashow af en toe bezetten militairen een bedrijf houdt morales een patriottische toespraak worden er fotos gemaakt en daarna gaat iedereen weer weg wij eisen de onmiddellijke en volledige overname van alle buitenlandse bedrijven in de brandstofindustrie
3107921 ze werkten zich kapot en kregen als salaris alleen te eten en n keer per jaar een nieuwe pantalon en een hemd
3107922 ik wilde verandering maar geen burgeroorlog het radicale linkse beleid van morales zet groepen tegen elkaar op evo blijkt niet meer dan een marxistische marionet van president hugo ch vez in la paz en laat zich door voormalige guerrillastrijders adviseren
3107923 een van de substanti le problemen van de huidige regering is het gebrek aan professionaliteit de leden van regeringspartij mas beweging naar het socialisme hebben geen kennis van het openbare bestuur hun beleid wordt vooral ingegeven door een gedateerd links discours

3107952 when you look at the rarity provenance and historical importance of ashcans you cant help but fall in love with them
3107953 this was my first comic purchase and in the last month ive also acquired a cgc cetified 7 5 superman 1 and a a cgc cetified 8 5 detective comics 27 ashcans are more than comic books theyre a part of americana when rochester new york dealer adam perlman contacted me i couldnt believe that the superman ashcan was available i expect it to be a seven figure book at some point
3107954 collectors interested in museum quality collectibles are attracted to ashcans because of their importance in establishing trademarks for some of the most important titles in our nations popular culture
3107955 if one considers for a moment that the first time that the superman logo in all its glory ever appeared on a comic book was on this ashcan edition you realize youre holding a pop culture artifact of the highest order

3107969 meerkats demonstrate altruistic behavior within their colonies one or more meerkats stand sentry lookout while others are foraging or playing to warn them of approaching dangers
3107970 meerkats are also known to share their burrow with the yellow mongoose and ground squirrel species with which they do not compete for resources if they are unlucky sometimes they share their burrow with snakes
3107971 meerkats actively teach their young young of most species learn solely by observing adults for example meerkat adults teach their pups how to eat a venomous scorpion they will remove the stinger and help the pup learn how to handle the creature
3107972 despite this altruistic behaviour meerkats sometimes kill young members of their group subordinate meerkats have been seen killing the offspring of more senior members in order to improve their own offsprings position
3107973 meerkats have been known to engage in social activities including what appear to be wrestling matches and foot races

3108024 the voices from the nations four corners will be crucial in forcing mr musharraf to reconsider his position
3108025 they the military will remain out of the picture and remain neutral as things stand right now

3108033 you know pictures can tell us that terrible things happen in the world
3108034 these dead are supremely uninterested in the living in those who took their lives and witnesses and in us why should they seek our gaze what would they have to say to us we this we is everyone who has never experienced anything like what they went through we dont understand we dont get it we truly cant imagine what it was like
3108035 we cant imagine how dreadful how terrifying war is and how normal it becomes cant understand cant imagine thats what every soldier every journalist and aid worker and independent observer who has put in time under fire and had the luck to elude the death that struck down others nearby stubbornly feels and they are right
3108036 he is regarded in the military as a safe pair of hands
3108037 he has earned a reputation for being very calm and giving measured well thought out responses
3108038 an attempt to restore order and avoid confrontation and further escalation
3108039 georgian troops are storming tskhinvali the capital they are bombing the city
3108040 it is premature to say what this military operation will entail it is not targeting civilians but rather paramilitary criminals who are using ammunition
3108041 georgias step is absolutely incomprehensible and shows that the georgian leadership has zero credit of trust
3108042 it appears that the south ossetians have instigated this uptick in violence
3108043 we have urged the russians to urge their south ossetian friends to pull back and show greater restraint and we believe that the russians are trying to do just that
3108044 mr kennedy has been diagnosed with a dislocated shoulder but will not be undergoing immediate surgery instead kennedy will undergo two weeks of physical therapy to determine whether the surgery will be necessary

3108060 only to support activities in the geographic areas which were subject to the administration of the government of israel before june 5 1967
3108061 for activities which the president determines are inconsistent with the objectives and understandings reached between the united states and israel regarding the implementation of the loan guarantee program
3108062 when israel does occupy this territory deep within the west bank and connects the 200 or so settlements with each other with a road and then prohibits the palestinians from using that road or in many cases even crossing the road this perpetrates even worse instances of apartness or apartheid than we witnessed even in south africa
3108063 despite a 1999 high court ruling prohibiting pain causing interrogation techniques the shin bet israel security agency continues to torture and degrade palestinian detainees in violation of international law human rights spokespersons charged on tuesday moreover one of the spokespersons said the government had ignored a 1994 justice ministry decision to transfer the investigation of complaints against shin bet interrogators from shin bet to the independent police investigations department these allegations came during a conference in jerusalem sponsored by united against torture and the public committee aginst torture in israel pcati
3108064 the united nations is not a place for jews to rely on for protection or fairness the oil rich arab countries have never given significant amounts of money to relieve arab muslim economic suffering in the west bank gaza or lebanon if they did those people would not have the ghettos they have today
3108065 sure thats what you say and thats the general consensus in the united states the fact is that when the palestinians dug under the israeli wall from gaza and captured the israeli soldier one soldier at the time israel was holding 9 200 palestinians prisoner including 300 children some of them 12 years old and holding almost 100 women prisoner and immediately the palestinians who took the soldier said we want to swap this soldier for some of our women and children and the israelis rejected that proposal and refused to swap at all with the palestinians in the west bank that was the key issue so its right that the palestinians took a soldier which they should release but for israel to keep 9 000 palestinians and not release any of them is something that you dont mention in the question and its generally no even known in this country
3108066 i cannot assure you that things will go as planned
3108067 do the islamic arab countries allow jews to own property in their lands
3108068 for me i wanted to find out what kind of life i could live somewhere else said the 29 year old teacher at the jewish school in the heart of old damascus kosher meat shops and fine tailored clothing stores were up for sale gracious old houses the classic dama scene townhouses hidden in the citys ancient alleys their intricate tile court yards draped with shade trees and hanging vines were passed on to the few friends or family members who stayed behind or sold to muslims you must remember jatati said our people our community used to have the best cars the best shops right in the center of damascus one man had a shop worth 20 million syrian pounds about 450 000 he sold it for 6 million about 133 000 you must realize his position over the last 18 months a population of perhaps 3 800 syrian jews has shrunk to just 300 in damascus and 100 or so in the northeastern town of kamishli but now over the last few weeks the sound of sad farewells has given way to noise of welcoming celebrations the shutters are opening on closed up jewish houses slowly but surely many of those who left are finding that life in brooklyn and france was not what they had hoped for and they are coming home yousef jajati head of the syrian jewish community expects that many more will be returning over the next several months reflecting a growing disillusionment with life abroad and reaffirming ties to a nation that has been their homeland for more than two millennia
3108069 do the islamic arab countries allow jews to own property in their lands
3108070 about 125 000 jews left iraq for israel in the late 1940s and 1952 most because they had been lied to and put into a panic by what i came to learn were zionist bombs but my mother and father were among the 6 000 who did not go to israel although physically i never did return to iraq that bridge had been burned in any event my heart has made the journey there many many times my father had it right and i began to find out about the barbaric methods used to rid the fledgling state of as many palestinians as possible the world recoils today at the thought of bacteriological warfare but israel was probably the first to actually use it in the middle east in the 1948 war jewish forces would empty arab villages of their populations often by threats sometimes by just gunning down a half dozen unarmed arabs as examples to the rest to make sure the arabs couldnt return to make a fresh life for themselves in these villages the israelis put typhus and dysentery bacteria into the water wells i was there and heard their grief our hearts are in pain when we look at the orange trees that we planted with our own hands please let us go let us give water to those trees god will not be pleased with us if we leave his trees untended i asked the military governor to give them relief but he said no we want them to leave i could no longer be part of this oppression and i left those palestinians who didnt sign up for transfers were taken by force just put in trucks and dumped in gaza about four thousand people were driven from al majdal in one way or another the few who remained were collaborators with the israeli authorities
3108071 born in iraq my culture still iraqi arabic my religion jewish my citizenship american
3108072 you think that you can ignore the truth by not answering my questions it will not work
3108073 in 1973 did the arab nations attack israel on yom kippur a day when jews would be praying to god and fasting amp thus have its defences down to attack
3108074 were not jews banned from praying at the western wall when jordan was in control of jerusalem prior to the 1967 war
3108075 was not anwar sadat murdered for signing the peace treaty with israel
3108076 and finally a question for the people reading this what can we you and me do to raise american consciousness about this issue
3108077 jesus believed it i guess he was a jewish zionist lier also
3108078 a small group of human rights workers to accompany palestinian children to their homes
3108079 yassin who had returned from overseas a few months earlier had apparently not yet internalized the fact that it is dangerous to remind a soldier that a palestinian is a human being when the soldier shoved yassin shoved back
3108080 the truth is that even soldiers parents should not be interested in these explanations
3108081 only if you give up your jewishness and submit to a multi cultural democracy
3108082 in fact it matters little what you call it so long as it is recognized that what israel intends and is working toward is the erasure of the palestinian people from the palestine landscape
3108083 children shot to death sitting in school classrooms here families murdered while tilling their land there agriculture land stripped and burned here farmers cut off from their land there little girls riddled with bullets here infants beheaded by shell fire there a little massacre here a little starvation there expulsion here denial of entry and families torn apart there dispossession is the name of the game with no functioning economy dwindling food supplies medical supply shortages no way to move from one area to another no access to a capital city no easy access to education or medical care no civil service salaries the people will die the nation will die without a single gas chamber or so the israelis hope
3108084 if israel is were eliminated it would not cause peace in the region or the world the moslems also have a problem with western civilization represented in the form of christianity
3108085 and finally a question for the people reading this what can we you and me do to raise american consciousness about this issue
3108086 the only way to peace in the world is to get rid of the oppressive dictatorships and religious fundamentalists who kill in the name of god
3108087 he talks about wanting a democratic multi cultural state in place of the jewish state of israel does he not see that israel is already the only democratic multi cultural state in the region already
3108088 the truth is there is oppression amp brutality in the west bank amp gaza but it is not israels fault it is the terrorist organizations hamas amp hezbollah and countless other groups who are the source of their oppression
3108089 1 what will happen when iran has a nuclear weapon 2 what will happen when the us puppet regimes of saudi arabia jordan and egypt are overthrown by the arab street just as is happening in iraq 3 what will happen when instead of fighting essentially unarmed muslim men women and children israel is confronted with nuclear armed muslim army that is seething with anger for the years of brutality openly and arrogantly meted out to palestinians leboneses by the israelis 4 i expect there is going to be a precipitous move to make peace and also emigrate 5 the day of a nuclear armed muslim arab army is not far away it is inevitable
3108090 a regime has been established which does not show mercy even to kids destroys houses while the occupants are still in them announces beforehand its list and plans to assassinate palestinian figures and keeps thousands of palestinians in prison such a phenomenon is unique or at the very least extremely rare in recent memory another big question asked by people is why is this regime being supported
3108091 all that is going on in palestine for the last 11 months is sufficient to call the wrath of god upon the united states and israel
3108092 an international coalition to rid the region and the world of a monster is a good thing
3108093 iraq its the right war but at the wrong time
3108094 during the conflict palestinian children have consistently made up a disproportionately large number of palestinian deaths in this first year childrens deaths accounted for 24 of the palestinians killed while childrens deaths accounted for 17 of israelis killed during this time abc reported on 56 israeli childrens deaths including repetitions in later newscasts and 19 palestinian childrens deaths 200 of israeli children and 15 of palestinian children a ratio of 13 8 to 1 cbs reported on 37 israeli childrens deaths including repetitions and 27 palestinian childrens deaths 132 of israeli childrens deaths and 21 of palestinian childrens deaths a ratio of 6 4 to 1 nbc reported on 45 israeli childrens deaths including repetitions and 17 palestinian childrens deaths 161 of israeli children and 13 of palestinian childrens deaths a ratio of 12 4 to 1 collectively the networks reported on an average of 46 israeli childrens deaths 164 of the israeli children killed and 21 palestinian childrens deaths 16 of the palestinian children killed in other words the networks reported on israeli childrens deaths at a rate 10 2 times greater than palestinian childrens deaths to understand the pattern of network news coverage of childrens deaths it is useful to compare the number of deaths reported to the actual number that took place while repeated coverage of israeli childrens deaths creates an impression of a higher number of israeli victims than there actually were omissions of the majority of palestinian childrens deaths considerably under represents the number of palestinian child victims comparing the day by day reporting of childrens deaths to the actual daily death toll reveals an additional dimension of the distortion in this comparison we discover that the reports on palestinian childrens deaths followed the curve for israeli childrens deaths rather than the much steeper curve of their actual death count this finding underscores the tendency by all three networks to report a fictional situation in which israeli and palestinian deaths occur at more or less the same rate and illustrates the substantial gap between the reality of palestinian fatalities and the coverage of them it suggests that the desire to appear balanced is too often prioritized above the need for accuracy
3108095 israel is certainly not perfect but you cant make peace with enemies who have no interest in peace its not to the advantage of hamas to make peace after all its not to the advantage of syria and iran either what choice is there

3108112 turkiska folk b rjade p allvar att hota det bysantinska riket fr n och med 1000 talet och fram t slaget vid manzikert 1071 mellan bysans och det seldjukiska imperiet resulterade i att anatolien de centrala omr det i nuvarande turkiet ppnades f r er vring r 1453 intog osmanerna konstantinopel nuvarande istanbul vilket innebar slutet f r det bysantinska riket osmanerna avancerade ven s der och sterut och hade vid 1500 talets b rjan inf rlivat stora delar av den arabiska halv n samt n stan hela nordafrika imperiets norra del gr nsade till sterrike och polen fr n mitten p 1500 talet till slutet p 1600 talet var det osmanska riket som mest inflytelserikt och omfattande

3108122 it was very exciting and moreover it was on our home soil
3108123 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3108124 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3108125 government crackdowns often silence the uighurs or discourage them from speaking out most will only speak to reporters on condition of anonymity
3108126 that was the answer given after a grin and a chuckle on monday by a merchant walking through kuqas market which was bustling with life again after the city was shut down by security forces most of sunday because of the attacks
3108127 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3108128 the uighurs are driving cars and motorcycles they have shops
3108129 he accused the chinese of restricting the study and practice of islam he also said uighurs suffered job discrimination and were discouraged from using their turkic language
3108130 if you are a muslim you are already a criminal suspect in the eyes of the chinese
3108131 there may be just a rising sense of resentment and disgruntlement that have led to these attacks on the police

3108136 there is no ban on importation of day old chicks from uganda and urged ugachick and other exporters to resume exports to kenya but should only be done through your appointed agents in kenya

3108148 ssalongo had abandoned his wife and children for about one week after a domestic quarrel and was staying in an unknown place allegedly with another woman
3108149 they were young and risked catching diseases whenever we mentioned it to their mother she kept quiet
3108150 hopelessness and thinking that the future was useless for her and kids might have triggered her action off
3108151 in her mind killing them and herself was seen as a solution an end to the pain and sorrow however outrageous it was
3108152 if she had suspected the husband of cheating she could have talked to a relative other than killing the whole family

3108161 we arrived at the hospital at 2 30 and brodie was dead by 5 30 in the morning
3108162 i think a lot parents know their children are protected but fail to realize there are other strains
3108163 this disease is spread through saliva like sucking on the same water bottle as one of your teammates
3108164 there are a lot decisions that go into a publicly funded program and there are only so many health care dollars available
3108165 had we known the vaccine was available we would have made private arrangements to have brodie covered
3108166 no other kid in the province should die from this devastating disease
3108167 no other parents should suffer the tragedy that my wife and i have suffered and will likely suffer the rest of our lives

3108198 given the proximity of the new school term and since pupils from alrewas have previously always received free transport to john taylor i have agreed that the children transferring from primary school this september will be issued with temporary free passes until christmas this will allow time for a considered response to be made with regard to the availability of walking routes to john taylor high school
3108199 i have told peter traves director of education in a series of letters and emails that i have seen the route that pupils are expected to walk along the a38
3108200 while i am delighted that a temporary respite has been offered up until christmas this must be made permanent i have told peter traves that the county owes a duty of care to its children and if an accident were to happen the county would be morally and legally liable but i dont want that put to the legal test it is vital that an accident is avoided that can only happen if the county permanently reverse their mad decision to make vulnerable children walk alongside the a38

3108478 my grand parents thought us to do the right thing with wild life
3108479 first of all there are federal and state laws that prohibit keeping wild birds and there are so many important but subtle elements to raising a wild bird that the job is only legally entrusted to licensed rehabilitators many well meaning people raise baby birds or rescue birds from cats or after accidents and sometimes they dont realize that the bird in their care is suffering from a serious dietary deficiency some of the problems arent apparent to untrained people but can cause death or make the bird less likely to evade predators or to survive harsh natural weather conditions

3108481 the message that i want to send them conservatives is that if they want to enter into a nasty fight or contest then i will join that battle i will use whatever tools are available to me and i can be nasty myself i would much prefer that we carry this contest on as we have in the last three elections in a respectful manner
3108482 if they wanted to take me out i would think youd get someone whos looking forward to building a political career not somebody whos at the age where hes considering retirement

3108490 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
3108491 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
3108492 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
3108493 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
3108494 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
3108495 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france
3108496 id see things out of the corner of my eye id see shadows

3108505 george washington long ago warned america against entangling alliances and he was right
3108506 russia and georgia risk falling into a full scale war in which the u s can and hopefully will avoid any involvement but had georgia been a member of nato we would now be risking a full scale confrontation with nuclear armed russia
3108507 obviously america should encourage both countries to back down and resolve their differences peacefully
3108508 the status of south ossetia as well as abkhazia another russian supported separatist zone within georgia matters a lot more to russia on which the two territories border than to the u s moreover washington itself set a precedent for russia when it intervened in kosovo a decade ago attacking serbia to win independence for the separatist ethnic albanian majority
3108509 we should not create or expand alliances where the u s does not have vital interests if the europeans want to defend distant countries like georgia they can do so after all the european union has a larger population and bigger gdp than america without any of washingtons other global military commitments it is time for europe to accept responsibility for its own security
3108510 any war is tragic but not every war requires american intervention
3108511 we can do our best to mediate between russia and georgia but we should avoid any military involvement it is time to put the defense of america back into americas defense policy

3108515 they claim its been going in budget support but thats not the answer were talking about 700m a year missing the rest has been taken by mush for some scheme or other and weve got to find it

3108526 es gab keine alternative nachdem georgien angefangen hat mit dieser grausamen offensive auch mit raketenangriffen
3108527 bekurow in l ndern wie deutschland und frankreich scheinen sich die medien m he zu geben den konflikt zu verstehen und ausgewogen zu berichten das sagen auch meine kollegen aber vor allem ber cnn und auch ber die bbc bin ich schockiert da sind im bild ganz klar georgische kampfjets zu sehen im text wird von russischen gesprochen und wenn im bild ossetische tote sind spricht der reporter von georgischen opfern wenn ich das sehe f hle ich mich hilflos
3108528 heute de glauben sie nicht dass da jemand in den tv redaktionen im aktualit tsdruck die bilder falsch zugeordnet oder interpretiert haben k nnte bekurow nein so offensichtliche fehler kann man nicht machen das ist absicht die osseten haben in den augen der welt ffentlichkeit die falschen helfer und werden deshalb voreilig als separatisten abgestempelt aber meiner meinung nach ist es das erste mal in der modernen geschichte dass russland in den kaukasus nicht als angreifer kommt sondern um die menschen zu verteidigen ich sage es noch mal georgien hat angefangen mit den angriffen
3108529 es waren die russen die anfingen sie sind in der nacht auf freitag einmarschiert nur deshalb stie en georgische streitkr fte nach s dossetien vor um den russen den nachschub abzuschneiden
3108530 russland hat die er ffnung der olympischen spiele dazu genutzt um sozusagen in ihrem windschatten einzumarschieren
3108531 wie der konflikt zu l sen ist im moment wohl gar nicht m sste man aus heutiger sicht sagen wenn man denn ehrlich ist sp ter vielleicht dadurch dass die s dosseten nach russland bersiedeln was nat rlich den bitteren beigeschmack einer deportation h tte und an stalins vertreibungen w hrend der vierziger jahre erinnern w rde die abchasen aber brauchen eine weitgehende autonomie

3108561 you know how we do it were going to evaluate what we see based on performance
3108562 like i said plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress
3108563 quite a few of the players know the situation and have been in communication with him
3108564 well address that down the road hes got some guys here that really care about him
3108565 he wants to come back im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going to get back up here with the guys
3108566 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
3108567 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
3108568 im not going to answer any more shawn questions until i see shawn
3108569 you cant put a timetable on what shawns going through
3108570 and thats one of the issues so weve got to prepare like hes not there and its kind of brutal but thats the way youve got to approach it if he can play football he can play if he cant then well move on youve got to be right as a person before you come out and play football thats what the issue is
3108571 i just want to be on the field but if i had to choose i would take tackle
3108572 let me rephrase that with tra out there id rather play guard but if tra is not going to be out there id rather play tackle i feel like its a little easier on your body you get to work a little more athleticism in than brute force but youve got to do a little more technique there and im a little rusty
3108573 i thought he played very well actually it will be another challenge for him there

3108578 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
3108579 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every milliliter of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
3108580 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
3108581 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
3108582 a detailed description and name for each species of bacteria are needed so that different laboratories can recognise all of the bacterial species present in the mouth
3108583 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off

3108585 at this moment we all taking measures and the army and police are patrolling the streets to providing security
3108586 two or three buildings are being evaluated to see if there is structural damage
3108587 they make the decision who makes the team and who sits on the bench we hope they exercise that power to get this problem stopped
3108588 this is so much larger a problem than the general public is aware of
3108589 our first objective is raising awareness about how big of a problem it really is and not just continuing to deny that it is not going on in my school or district second is to educate parents coaches and teachers about how dangerous this drug really is
3108590 it is not typical of what we usually run into with the coaching community nationally
3108591 the kids sometimes dont like to hear it because its hard work to do it the right way and coaches are sometimes hesitant to deal with the steroid problem because that might be their starting quarterback or whatever hopefully we left them with the message that it can be a life or death issue
3108592 best buy doesnt make typos perhaps you should return to the store where you saw the poster and make your reservations there

3108611 dia abdul khalid bercakap soal kecemerlangan dan persaingan apakah persaingan antara pelajar uitm sedia ada tidak cukup sengit apakah orang melayu tidak boleh bersaing sesama dengan melayu kena masuk orang cina baru melayu tahu hendak bersaing
3108612 saya juga tidak percaya hanya kerana uitm menghimpunkan pelajar melayu dan bumiputera ia membawa kepada perpecahan dalam masyarakat
3108613 kalau dia abdul khalid kata hendak melahirkan perpaduan dengan bercampur orang india dan cina mengapa bermula di sini di uitm dia sepatutnya mencadangkan hanya ada satu sekolah untuk menggalakkan perpaduan dan ia mesti bermula di peringkat sekolah rendah
3108614 jadi saya memberi jaminan kepada semua pejuang yang telah mewujudkan uitm bahawa selagi saya menjadi menteri kedudukan uitm akan kekal
3108615 kalau kita lihat statistik enam bulan selepas tamat pengajian untuk tiga tahun kebelakangan ini seramai 81 peratus siswazah uitm dapat pekerjaan ini adalah lebih baik daripada sesetengah universiti
3108616 begitu juga purata siswazah yang belum dapat kerja selepas tiga bulan tamat belajar biasanya pada kadar 24 9 peratus tetapi hanya uitm 19 1 peratus dan bilangan itu adalah antara yang terbaik sekali dalam institusi pengajian tinggi awam dalam negara

3108739 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3108740 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia
3108741 the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay
3108742 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end
3108743 continued aggression against georgia and especially an escalation of the conflict beyond south ossetia will only serve to damage russias international reputation and its relations with countries across the globe
3108744 peaceful and speedy resolution to this crisis which maintains georgias territorial and political integrity
3108745 ive talked to my mum quite a bit and the phones ringing and theres a lot of media interest and of course its just my mum in christchurch shes not equipped to deal with something of this magnitude not that shes not capable its just that its so surreal that all of a sudden she gets drawn into this
3108746 we have a small family in new zealand but were tight i know shes hurting and shes very much a part of the broader picture

3108749 i am passionate about the game my job i enjoy coaching volleyball has been wonderful to elisabeth and i but at this stage its very easy for me to focus on the task at hand which is taking care of my immediate family
3108750 once weve got it taken care of we can look at other things in life but right now thats purely where my focus is
3108751 the one thing that has been incredible has been the huge groundswell of support to help us pick up the pieces and help us manage this difficult situation as best as we can he said
3108752 interest has been global but in no way have we exposed ourselves with dealing with our emails and our phonecalls or anything like that its just too overwhelming we appreciate that everyone is with us we are just in no capacity to deal with that right now
3108753 stood for all the right things and he lived them
3108754 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence there is no indication her that there was an pre meditation it seems unfortunately to be a case of the wrong place at the wrong time certainly in our opinion that is the way it seems to be
3108755 it hurts its its something that no one should have to got through lifes not fair so its never going to be about that kind of stuff
3108756 at the end of the day it happened and it seems the the sooner we can come to grips with that and kind of process it the better off were going to be anger isnt an emotion im going to allow myself to indulge in
3108757 certainly the team has been influenced by this its not exactly how you would want to prepare for your first match having to deal with a tragedy of this nature
3108758 instead we will be going one better and will focus on long term unemployed by requiring them to get paid work and get off the benefit
3108759 within 12 months of taking office national will require everyone who has been on the dole for more than a year to re apply for their benefit and undergo a comprehensive work assessment
3108760 the 1990s is back and today the national party showed how bereft they really are of new ideas

3108762 long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices

3108796 boiling everything down is arbitrage they buy low and sell higher presumably after adding some secret technology special sauce since there are tons of these companies right now and they are all offering pretty much the same value proposition the only real lever that they have to compete on is cost and here the cost is totally defined in direct response metrics cost per click cost per action cost per application and so on
3108797 basic free market theory suggests that this will be a run to the bottom each turn of the wheel will net lower and lower gross costs to the network and net costs to the publisher what is more this model totally focuses the agency and eventually the client on dr metrics with no attention paid to the brand given some of the placements that these networks produce campaigns that run through them can often actually devalue the marketer brand but since the focus in not on that end of the paradigm no one is paying attention to it

3108804 could senator clinton win the democratic presidential nomination at the last minute by taking advantage of buyers remorse among democratic super delegates who are dismayed by the performance of senator obamas campaign so far what if by the time the convention rolls around mr obama isnt just running neck and neck with mr mccain but is lagging by say five percentage points or if mr obama makes a big blunder with his choice of a running mate or some other campaign stumble

3108816 that is what i am depressed about at the moment the kind of charmlessness of most comedy on television

3108911 there will be no working life conference this year we will be looking to hold events later in the year but the cost and lack of interest in working life conference last year means we are not going ahead this year
3108912 there was literally zero support from cchq for the entire time i was on the exec
3108913 i thought that karen allen and her team did a great job and had they had even the slightest bit of support from cchq they would have delivered but the fact is that cchq dont want to know about young professionals unless they are in donor clubs
3108914 its been 6 months since they started i am a young professional in london and this is the first time i have heard from the nme on working life and i bet im not the only one
3108915 the web address www cfwlconference co uk is clearly still owned by conservative future
3108916 the prime minister was freed this afternoon along with three other government officials i understand that only the president is still being held
3108917 the six representatives firmly condemned the coup and said it was unacceptable to overthrow a democratically elected president and demanded that the president and his prime minister are set free and constitutional order is restored
3108918 the soldiers were provided with combat first aid by other members of the sotg to stabilise their condition and the area surrounding the blast site was secured in preparation for a helicopter casualty evacuation
3108919 we need to show a united front but we also need to be united in our aim to get the conservative party elected
3108920 pienso que el gobierno de rosales mantiene una actitud de lenidad con los paramilitares lo que al parecer forma parte de su planteamiento separatista
3108921 estoy seguro de que el gobierno nacional est plenamente dispuesto a enfrentar el secuestro en todos sus frentes
3108922 a friendly test between two histori cal institutions fifty overs between two teams of gentleman cricketers
3108923 mr johnson said an obama win could boost the self image of young black londoners
3108924 john mccain has many many wonderful qualities but i think a barack obama victory would do fantastic things for the confidence and the feelings of black people around the world
3108925 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3108926 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3108927 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3108928 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication
3108929 until now all that we have had from the international community is humanitarian aid which is starting to arrive and statements
3108930 of course this is important but we need much more
3108931 until now all that we have had from the international community is humanitarian aid which is starting to arrive and statements
3108932 of course this is important but we need much more
3108933 it can be safely asserted that if she had been born 10 years earlier beaumont bott would not be a member of the conservative party
3108934 liza chantelle any favours she isnt my cup of tea and i do know a lot of people have a problem with her but i think that article doesnt really do her justification
3108935 she said he did she is a blah blah blah
3108936 it can be safely asserted that if she had been born 10 years earlier beaumont bott would not be a member of the conservative party
3108937 yo creo que el tiempo de las proclamas ha pasado las palabras deben servir para aportar soluciones y no para exacerbar pasiones malentendidas

3108940 los que queremos hacer las cosas tal y como las pactamos
3108941 lo que me sorprende es que los l deres de la oposici n que han recurrido el estatuto ahora haga preguntas sobre un estatuto en el que no creen nunca arriman el hombro y siempre mantienen una postura incoherente
3108942 the city is spending an incredible amount of money to buy water we should be able to pour out of our own wells you certainly will have the cooperation from staff and weve made that incredibly clear to staff
3108943 we really need to see the federal government taking a partnership position
3108944 in the end this all comes down to whos going to pay for it
3108945 we really need to see the federal government taking a partnership position
3108946 in the end this all comes down to whos going to pay for it
3108947 i want to make it perfectly clear that our decision to move this case to the grand jury phase in no way is to be taken as an indication that the morris county prosecutors office believes that a crime has been committed by the police officers
3108948 this action is simply taken pursuant to the attorney general guidelines for police related shootings where a death has occurred
3108949 we are obligated under those rules to either prepare a report to the attorney general or present the matter to a grand jury
3108950 in this case for complete integrity of this investigation i am doing both this ensures the maximum amount of checks and balances possible under the law
3108951 proceeding before the grand jury is a true and tried way to ensure that the matter is fully and fairly presented to the court and to ensure that the unbiased truth is the guiding principal
3108952 i will publicly divulge the full set of facts at a time permitted by law
3108953 to release the video or any investigative facts sooner is an egregious violation of the ethics rules
3108954 investigations of this type take time if they arte to be done correctly the morris county prosecutors office legal and investigative team has been working very hard on this matter and have kept all interested parties fully apprised of the progress of the investigation the public respectfully must understand that we will proceed in a calm and deliberate fashion and not be influenced to prematurely act or speak of the facts when it is legally inappropriate to do so
3108955 is a full and fair investigation and presentation of the evidence so that the truth is ascertained and not to be rushed to judgment where sloppiness and other negative influences have the capacity to affect our attempts to ascertain the truth

3108964 we will be one of the only vendors to provide wired and wireless solutions that integrated end to end to our customers so that is key part
3108965 with this acquisition we have extended our capabilities in the wlan wireless lan space to include 802 11n and that will be a big part of that portfolio it also helps us augments the solutions that we are already providing in the market today
3108966 their social networking pages show pictures of an england of pimms polo and county shows
3108967 they can smell victory and they want it very badly
3108968 we should take pieces like this and learn from them next time cfers are in the presence of journos maybe keep the snuff in the jacket pocket maybe not talk about getting naked and for fuck sake make your photos private on facebook
3108969 all our problems come from foreigners getting drunk smashing windows and stealing
3108970 mussolini had his positive side the streets were safe in his day
3108971 send them to the country or send them somewhere they are dirty and there are lots of problems with burglary and thieving they make toxic smoke
3108972 these things were done in the fascist days when gipsies were killed or sent to concentration camps
3108973 the politicians should remember that we are human not garbage
3108974 our main goal is to get the most detailed images and remote sensing data ever of the geologically active features on enceladus
3108975 from this data we may learn more about how eruptions tectonics and seismic activity alter the moons surface we will get an unprecedented high resolution view of the active area immediately following the closest approach
3108976 knowing the sizes of the particles their rates and what else is mixed in these jets can tell us a lot about whats happening inside the little moon
3108977 wed like to refine our numbers and see which fracture or stripe is hotter than the rest because these results can offer evidence one way or the other for the existence of liquid water as the engine that powers the plumes
3108978 jesus is instructed to watch israels house and not leave the place while the master goes away on a tour to collect clothes to be dyed but no sooner has israel left the house than jesus runs out with the boys terian says
3108979 the most amazing part of the story of the nine year old jesus playing a form of cricket with the boys at the sea shore is that he would go on playing the game on water over the sea waves
3108980 he jesus would take the boys to the seashore and carrying the playing ball and the club he would go over the waves of the sea as though he was playing on a frozen surface hitting the playing ball
3108981 but the apocryphal story shows that for a ball game even jesus would forget work and would go to have fun with the boys he says
3108982 most of the audience thought it was being shown live so that was mission accomplished
3108983 i do hope whoever gets in introduces 2 year terms the current exec have only been in a very short time and everybodys already speculating about whos going to replace them
3108984 look at how the young conservative movement has become all modern and trendy
3108985 se le echar mucho de menos ya no hay muchos como l
3108986 era un actor de personajes impactantes capaz de interpretar con facilidad papeles de buenos y de malos

3108990 tom was very nervous more so than ever before i think he really struggled to get through the competition and as his partner it was hard for me to get up there and try and ease him into it
3108991 when we were sitting down i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call but tom went to me what are you on the phone for
3108992 thats just tom being over nervous thats how it was today tom should not be worrying about what im doing today he was worrying about everyone and everything and for me that is really the sole reason why he didnt perform today
3108993 it was a great experience it just didnt happen for us today
3108994 for me my time is now to get a medal i believe ill still be around for 2012 but divings evolved so much
3108995 we stayed consistent we didnt miss anything we just didnt hit it to the best of our potential
3108996 could be one of the top gadget gifts this holiday season
3108997 although amzn has not disclosed kindle sales our collection of data points leads us to double our 08 unit assumption from 190 000 to 380 000 in its first year 2002 thats exactly how many ipods were sold turns out the kindle is becoming the aapl ipod of the book world
3108998 kindles a great product but we dont think the addressable market is anywhere near the size of the ipod market
3108999 we think it will ultimately appeal to a much smaller slice of the market than the ipod
3109000 a dearth of gadget gifts in the fourth quarter except the 3g iphone
3109001 i think its still a pretty small story its a nice story but its a little early for it to be driving the stock
3109002 over half of all people who shop online go to amazon first
3109003 there is always the possibility of amazon not being able to convert shipments into sales and simply stuffing the channel but the channel in this case would have to be amazons own warehouses
3109004 were just beginning to see where this will lead but it marks an overall shift in how things are going to be done in the mobile environment
3109005 letter to a new president commonsense lessons for our next leader
3109006 son of privilege and dynasty who had defined himself as the president of only that fraction of the country which shared his world view
3109007 sen byrd doesnt believe sen mccain is going to be the next president
3109008 but if sen mccain is interested in receiving a copy of the book wed be happy to get him a copy
3109009 a big lie is still a lie tell the truth
3109010 let the press do its job even when that might sting
3109011 i would submit that a president who is unable to learn from his or her own mistakes and then to articulate for a curious public what he or she has learned is not prepared for that office
3109012 banished himself to the ignominious position of worst united states president ever
3109013 built much of its program around a basic commitment to lying
3109014 we must rebuild a culture of intolerance to lying and that must start close to home
3109015 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spin off
3109016 when they say you cant go home again its not true im headed back to the zip code i know best and couldnt be happier
3109017 the cw has no deal with tori spelling to appear on 90210 at this time
3109018 im alan yeah i just got into an argument with my drunk wife

3109020 los partidos no pueden hacer ingresar gente al congreso por la puerta chica
3109021 vamos a cumplir todo lo que la constituci n y la ley al partido socialista le indica
3109022 espero es que los candidatos a parlamentarios el pr ximo a o cuando concurran al partido socialista a pedir cupo recuerden lo que dicen hoy d a hoy se desprecia a los partidos y ma ana se les valora hoy se les denigra y ma ana se les ensalza y debiese siempre haber la misma conducta no s lo cuando uno necesita el cupo
3109023 un interlocutor con el que tenemos una muy buena relaci n
3109024 the united states has long expressed concerns about government financial support for the launch of commercial aircraft and has pursued this issue with the europeans in the wto world trade organization
3109025 washington will take a very careful look at the support announced by canada quebec and the u k to ensure they do not distort the market for commercial airliners or contravene wto rules
3109026 the governments we are working with are totally aware of the wto rules and we are confident the repayable government investment we have arranged is compliant with these international obligations
3109027 there will be no more flowers sent my loved ones are getting giant fortune cookies from now on
3109028 with photoshop elements im able to capture memories that are very special to me in my life and create beautiful works of art
3109029 the call recorder card service enable the user to record all incoming and outgoing cell phone calls creating a digital record of all conversations for later playback or storage on a pc
3109030 the service simply re routes all calls through a telecommunications switch and records the conversations for you there is no extra equipment to connect to the phone and the service works on any phone regardless of service provider it is the absolute easiest way to record a cell phone conversation
3109031 add uncertainty complexity new liability and a great deal of cost while compelling companies to provide potentially unreliable and often immaterial information about pending litigation
3109032 legal outcomes are inherently difficult if not impossible to predict
3109033 compelling companies to guess what the maximum liability might be or the likely outcome will undoubtedly lead to the disclosure of some arbitrary unreliable amounts and outcomes
3109034 current shareholders should not be injured to serve the potential needs of other categories of financial statement users
3109035 we see that many of the markets that we serve including law enforcement fire military safety commercial and industrial are ready and in need of engineered orthotics these products will greatly improve the comfort and safety of those who wear work boots work shoes or are primarily on their feet for extended periods of time we are proud to offer such an extensive line of quality products for these markets that far exceeds those of the competition
3109036 angies list is similar to craigslist in that its a long standing site it was launched back in 1995 that has local listings for over 140 us cities and metro areas
3109037 the downside of angies list however is that you have to pay to access its listings
3109038 weve found that even simple changes to improve usability are difficult or impossible to make at papers in the us
3109039 waiting for the next threat and reacting with some wimpy promotion is not a plan
3109040 with a little cooperation we might find that craigslist can help to turn around newspapers
3109041 our inability to deliver small targeted audiences is a significant reason behind why newspaper classifieds arent selling as well as they used to
3109042 maybe we could stop blaming the customers or the competition or craig newmark and think up a classified product that people might actually like
3109043 we shouldnt be afraid to knock down our walls and share our classifieds with other newspapers or even with other websites
3109044 a wide disconnect exists between what teens are thinking and feeling and what parents believe about their teens when it comes to attitudes about drug use

3109116 frauen in der rechten szene sind wie ein spiegelbild der gesellschaft das hei t sie k nnen ein traditionelles rollenmodell leben berufst tige m tter oder emanzipiert sein oder sogar gewaltbereit agieren
3109117 auch frauen sind politische akteurinnen sie gehen weit seltener als ihnen nachgesagt wird in die szene weil ihnen die jungs gefallen oder weil sie es dort besonders nett finden oder sie dort besonders hofiert werden sie gehen dahin weil sie rechts sind und rechte positionen haben f r die sie einstehen und k mpfen wollen

3109150 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
3109151 because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop
3109152 our legal team are going to be exhausting every possible channel for holding the police accountable for the draconian use of stop and search measures for the things they confiscated and for their violent incursions on to the camp

3109172 i have tremendous respect for st louis and the direction theyre going but it worked out best for me
3109173 in hindsight things couldnt have worked out better i still had something left in the tank and i think i proved that in the playoffs
3109174 seeing my friends doing it you get jealous in a good way
3109175 ive been around the stanley cup but i just wanted to touch it
3109176 i cant tell you what it feels like it because i never thought id be driving to the airport to pick up the stanley cup
3109177 it seems like i just started my rookie year you learn a lot and you change your game year to year i think i did that and did it well i wasnt the biggest guy or the best player but i did things that kept me in the league i played the game the right way and i played hard i hope i had my teammates respect because thats what meant the most to me
3109178 any time youre the captain of a team any place its an honor
3109179 but to be a captain in the nhl that meant a lot to me
3109180 i couldnt think of a better way to go out
3109181 ive said all along that if the right situation comes along id definitely look at it
3109182 you get back in the car after practicing and pick up right where you left off
3109183 i was never a major prospect and it was never an easy road the only way to make it was to work hard and not get down
3109184 i was in the minors for six years and i saw goalies get mentally deflated and feel like they were getting overlooked i kept telling myself that eventually i would get a chance then when i got to the nhl i was a depth guy a guy who could play while the kids developed a space filler but thats not what i thought your belief system has to be strong
3109185 chris is going to come in and help us and if they push each other thats wonderful internal competition thats a fact of life well worry about ice time issues when they come up
3109186 its been a few things he wanted to work on when to stay down when to get back to your feet
3109187 they are skills the new goalies coming up have like a carey price who is very good technique wise chris has been in the league awhile and he wanted to go back and focus on his skills
3109188 if the body is trained one way it takes a lot of repetition and going over it slowly to build up your muscle memory
3109189 the kids coming up have more efficient ways of making saves im just really trying to strengthen that part of my game getting used to making those movements so it feels natural
3109190 the big thing with chris hes a real good person
3109191 he sits in the same dressing room as the kids theres no arrogance and no ego chris is a guy whos played long enough he could have an attitude but he knows where he came from im sure manny is another one who worked so hard to get there he respects his journey a little more
3109192 my only focus coming to st louis would be earning the respect of the coaches and the players
3109193 i havent set any seasonal goals manny had an all star season last year and hes the guy they have faith in him and they should i look forward to learning from him and helping the blues get to the next level
3109194 i guess putting the sign in the lawn really makes it real
3109195 i think he did an unbelievably good job of representing st louis
3109196 he was pretty visible and everybody in st louis knew who he was its a credit to him and the way he handled himself
3109197 not a fun phone call to make especially at 10 30 it sounded like he was half asleep
3109198 those things are part of our job but its not fun especially when youre dealing with somebody whos been around so long
3109199 its amazing because i could have ended up on 28 other teams in that respect i was excited but at that point i was more focused on the fact that i was leaving st louis
3109200 with the quality of person he was you were always hoping he improved on the ice and thats what he did
3109201 hes been good for the blues he gave us a lot of hockey
3109202 in my heart i dont feel like the blues didnt want me
3109203 i think they had to go make a move and thats what they had to give up theres no hard feelings
3109204 what it will do will create new opportunities for guys like brad boyes david backes even lee stempniak and jay mcclement to step up and take control of the room
3109205 it just gives other guys an opportunity to step up and grow as players its part of the evolution
3109206 people say its a big city with a small town feel what theyre trying to say is theres a sense of community im really appreciative of how this community accepted me and i feel very lucky to have been here so long
3109207 the fans wanted to see more variety thats what they wanted and i think theres a lot more balance in that respect
3109208 the fans will get a chance to look at the players they only hear about i like variety too you dont get bored with it
3109209 we are excited to have jay in our core group of young players
3109210 he will provide some stability and experience on the penalty kill and we are expecting his offensive numbers to improve with the more ice time he gets
3109211 we had a pretty solid pk last year but losing two of our top guys theres going to be some holes to fill
3109212 its a goal of mine to be that guy thats always out there

3109332 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3109333 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3109334 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3109335 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3109336 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3109337 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3109338 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3109339 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3109340 these releases come just nine months after the release of the net framework 3 5 and visual studio 2008 and include a substantial number of updates based directly on customer feedback the service packs continue to address the needs of the developer community by making it even easier to develop applications for the latest platforms with new features such as the net framework client profile for faster deployment of windows based applications multiple enhancements to asp net and unparalleled support for database application development through the ado net entity framework ado net data services and integration with sql server 2008
3109341 the beauty of the net framework has always been that it makes it easier for developers to build applications that are visually stunning well connected and highly secure
3109342 we want to make sure we are keeping the end user experience in mind as well which is why we created the net framework client profile the net framework client profile significantly speeds up the installation of windows and enables a much more consumer friendly experience this is a huge step forward for the more than 4 million net developers worldwide
3109343 amp gt die f nfte ausgabe des schweizer online magazins hopehope mit dem titel
3109344 obviously we announced the title for both the ps3 and 360 so in that sense were very excited to be able to appeal to a new user base ans to fans that are users of both ps3 and 360
3109345 another thing im excited about it that its traditionally taken about a year for localisation to take place so the japanese version can reach audiences around the world but with this titles were focused on decreasing that time gap
3109346 that means right now were not only involved in creating and developing but also working hard to deliver the title in a fresh state to everyone in the world

3109348 for more than a year i and my assembly colleagues have warned that our state was entering a period of economic decline as a result of failed federal policies we forecasted the recession and called attention to potential weaknesses in the states revenue stream in january the assembly advanced a plan to address the subprime mortgage crisis and in june we acted on a plan to help homeowners pay their winter heating bills we will review the proposals advanced today by the governor and will continue to work with the governor and with our colleagues in the senate to address the challenges brought on by the current recession
3109349 while we are working cooperatively to get a head start on the 2009 10 state budget its important that the governor and legislature not take any actions that would force local governments to raise their local taxes to make up for a shortfall from albany
3109350 as for the governors proposed medicaid cuts i believe we must extract every dollar from the massive fraud that exists as the author of the legislation that created the states medicaid inspector general i know that we arent doing enough to root out waste fraud and abuse in the medicaid system we need to focus more of our energy on preventing those who are ineligible for medicaid from accessing benefits at taxpayer expense as it was recently reported that hundreds of thousands of out of state residents may be bilking our medicaid system
3109351 these are working families who for years have been paying taxes and supporting the medicaid program for others now when they need the program most we must redouble our commitment to ensuring that they will be able to access the care they need
3109352 however in just a few short weeks we have gone from suggestions of shared sacrifice to making hospitals and nursing homes into sacrificial lambs
3109353 bear in mind that the governors proposal represents only the state share of medicaid the full impact state and federal share combined to hospitals nursing homes and home health agencies would be more than 1 billion
3109354 moreover this plan in no way can be considered a balance of shared sacrifice when entire sectors are exempted from it
3109355 for awhile my office has been saying that new york state is facing serious fiscal challenges and spending well beyond our means the downturn in the economy has now elevated the problems limiting our options and creating significant out year budget gaps going forward
3109356 the participants demonstrated a perception that not having to attach receipts to the return creates a temptation for electronic filers to overstate their claims for deductions and credits
3109357 there is no need to supply receipts so sometimes people may think they can get away with it without getting caught
3109358 the underestimating part could be more forgetting or not adding things up properly or maybe theyre not sure they have all their information
3109359 they believed they would not be caught as long as the overstatements were relatively small
3109360 i would recommend people who think they can get away with this to not try it

3109378 im not going to make any money going to the olympics of course its a great honor but i need to think about supporting feeding my family
3109379 that being said this whole olympic thing its such an honor
3109380 i think this is an incredible imposition the worst timed event in the world all i really want to do is prepare for the u s open with money like what that pays why would i care about anything else

3109416 we do not believe the law allows auction sites like ebay to continue to turn a blind eye to this problem while reaping profits from the listing and sale of counterfeit merchandise trademark law does not impose a duty on tiffany to police ebays site ebay designed the site and has the responsibility to police it
3109417 if you look at a retail store the same applies
3109418 once a store owner knows there is a problem with counterfeiting it has a duty to investigate and take action in neither instance is there any obligation on the trademark owner to investigate what is happening on site at the flea market or the retail store yet ebay has set itself up and the district court seems to have agreed that tiffany has an obligation to police ebays site we dont believe that obligation exists in law and we respectfully disagree with the district court decision

3109420 the scout tells us that the tunnel and chamber was once a spur of a forgotten subway an underground maintenance area for the cars built in the 1920s in 1955 the tunnel suffered a collapse that flooded this section of the system and the lower portions of the track were abandoned 100 yards from the repair yard the tunnel now opens up directly to the east river
3109421 clearly someone had broken into the chamber from above probably in the sixties and build the steel stair that connected directly the basement wed stumbled into
3109422 we are starting to climb the mechanical stairs when there is loud cracking sound from upstairs and the scout shouts for us to leave as we race up the stairs and out into the street we hear behind us dull sounds of collapse and walk quickly away

3109439 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
3109440 the actions of the georgian leadership in south ossetia are a crime and foremost they are a crime against their own people because a deadly blow has been delivered to the territorial integrity of georgia which brings massive damage to its national identity
3109441 its hard to imagine after all that had happened and after all that is still happening theyll be able to convince south ossetia to be part of georgia
3109442 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people i think it would be correct if you instruct the military prosecutor to document all such incidents

3109452 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3109453 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3109476 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3109477 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3109478 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3109479 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3109480 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3109481 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3109482 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3109483 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3109484 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3109485 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3109486 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3109487 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3109488 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3109489 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3109490 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3109491 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3109492 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3109493 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3109494 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3109495 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3109496 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3109497 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3109498 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3109499 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3109500 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3109501 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3109502 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3109503 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3109504 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3109505 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3109506 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3109507 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3109508 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3109509 cest une mauvaise politique qui est men e par nos autorit s et celles de la russie dit un habitant ils auraient du se retrouver autour dune table et discuter ensemble
3109510 when you move they look at you when you stop they look at the screen
3109511 can you see this 8 point font no oh let me change it while you wait
3109512 ah this is a common mistake that ive made and heres what you should watch for
3109513 oh well ill invent something tomorrow before the presentation starts
3109514 you are the content and your slides are your table of contents
3109515 any proportionally spaced font is not appropriate for code demonstrations period full stop
3109516 how to give a presentation to people who can read
3109517 spontaneous speech is filled with disfluencies unwanted pauses elongated segments fillers such as uh and um editing expressions such as i mean and you know word fragments self corrections and repeated words most disfluencies seem to reflect planning problems when speakers cannot formulate an entire utterance at once they may suspend their speech and introduce a pause or filler before going on and when speakers change their minds about what they are saying they may suspend their speech and then add to delete or replace words they have already produced
3109518 what is required is a new human order of true men and women who will live reality and never turn away
3109519 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3109520 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3109521 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3109522 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3109523 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3109524 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3109525 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3109526 who are open to doing something on the production side
3109527 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3109528 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3109529 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3109530 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3109531 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3109532 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3109533 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3109534 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3109535 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3109536 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3109537 1 4 million people downloaded this album from you and that means 1 4 million people who would have bought this album didnt and so you owe us 21 million dollars
3109538 after years of debate over the reality of global warming 80 percent of those polled now say they accept it as fact
3109539 seventy three percent say it is a threat to todays children and 63 percent believe people and industry are to blame
3109540 rather than engage speech that strays too far from the dangerously narrow borders of our public discourse the gatekeepers of that discourse our mass media tend to effectively shout it down marginalize it or ignore it
3109541 a danger that the subtleties of the science and its uncertainty might be missed by reporters unfamiliar with the territory
3109542 scientists look for consistency among several reports before concluding something is true
3109543 if only all blunders were this funny pass me an egg
3109544 they said they were there to find out who the next vice president would be and i couldnt tell them it was me
3109545 began to be used more than 1 000 years ago and led to the occurrence of the first cases of schizophrenia
3109546 the highly charged climate surrounding environmental health risks can create powerful pressure for scientists to conform and to fall into line with a particular position
3109547 led initially to the carrying out of the studies based on weak hypotheses and inadequate methods which were greatly oversold
3109548 likened concern over weak emf from power lines to the fear that leaves falling from trees could fracture a persons skull

3109550 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3109551 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3109552 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3109553 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3109554 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3109555 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3109556 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3109557 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3109558 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3109559 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3109560 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3109561 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3109562 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3109563 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3109568 the u s government has spent some 7 billion building a repository for nuclear waste at yucca mountain in nevada
3109569 coal is making us sick oil is making us sick
3109570 on june 3 the department of energy submitted an 8 600 page application to the nuclear regulatory commission seeking approval of the yucca mountain site for waste storage just one day later nevada urged the agency to reject the application
3109571 no u s plant worker or member of the public has ever been injured or killed by an accident caused by nuclear power
3109572 we have enough game ideas to do geometry wars for probably about 10 games
3109573 the results suggest not all the large changes seen in arctic climate in recent years are a result of long term trends associated with global warming
3109574 our study confirms many changes seen in upper arctic ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature rather than trends caused by global warming
3109575 while some 1990s climate trends such as declines in arctic sea ice extent have continued these results suggest at least for the wet part of the arctic the arctic ocean circulation reverted to conditions like those prevalent before the 1990s
3109576 the winter of 2006 2007 was another high arctic oscillation year and summer sea ice extent reached a new minimum
3109577 it is too early to say but it looks as though the arctic ocean is ready to start swinging back to the counterclockwise circulation pattern of the 1990s again
3109578 the events of the 1990s may well be a preview of how the arctic will respond over longer periods of time in a warming world
3109579 the close agreement between the north pole pressure gauges and grace data demonstrates graces potential for tracking world ocean circulation
3109580 satellite altimeters such as nasas jason are ideal for studying ocean circulation but cant be used at earths poles due to ice cover
3109581 our results show grace can be a powerful tool for tracking changes in the distribution of mass in the arctic ocean as well as its circulation
3109582 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3109583 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3109584 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3109585 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3109586 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3109587 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3109588 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

3109697 os jogos ol mpicos s o um acontecimento mundial e se recorreu ao melhor da arquitetura mundial para esta ocasi o
3109698 pequim est levando a arquitetura para uma nova dire o
3109699 nenhuma cidade do mundo teve recentemente tantas obras projetadas por pessoas de prestigio mundial
3109700 a gente passa dez minutos aguardando para poder atravessar e se a gente paga os impostos a gente quer uma melhoria
3109701 devido ao crescimento populacional nas adjac ncias da rodovia ela perde as caracter sticas de via rural e passa a ter caracter sticas urbanas o perigo aumenta com certeza
3109702 acuso os l deres georgianos de limpeza tnica porque sua meta pol tica era eliminar a popula o uma nfima popula o da oss tia do sul porque sem ela imposs vel reintegrar a oss tia do sul ge rgia
3109703 como resultado do que ocorreu agora estou totalmente seguro que uma negocia o pol tica digo entre ge rgia e oss tia do sul jamais ser uma realidade nas pr ximas d cadas
3109704 um cessar fogo assinado por ambas as partes quando se re nem
3109705 todos est o bem apreensivos com tudo isso que est acontecendo
3109706 triste mas vamos ver no que vai dar tudo isso
3109707 a gente tem tentado ficar a par de tudo sempre solid rio mas muito dif cil porque a gente n o sabe o que eles est o vivendo
3109708 uma forma de eles tentarem associar o nome ao pa s que eles est o defendendo
3109709 e uma oportunidade de ter mais brasileiros nos jogos ol mpicos
3109710 realizei dois sonhos primeiro o de participar da olimp ada e segundo de jogar contra eles ricardo e emanuel aqui dentro da olimp ada
3109711 temos nossa casa l na ge rgia mas vivemos e treinamos s no brasil
3109712 recebemos de madrugada a not cia de que o conflito estava pior e surgiu essa possibilidade de a gente deixar os jogos
3109713 no come o ficamos tristes mas n o tristes por ter que sair e sim por eles
3109714 o que a gente podia fazer era tomar a posi o que eles decidissem
3109715 a not cia que eles est o recebendo a mesma que todos n s estamos recebendo pela internet porque nem todos est o conseguindo ligar para casa
3109716 o nosso presidente da confedera o tem uma esposa l e uma filha que nasceu h pouco tempo
3109717 queria muito ter ganhado esse jogo para dar um pouco de alegria a ele
3109718 a gente estava representando outra na o mas o cora o brasileiro
3109719 foi bem engra ado mas ao mesmo tempo ele ficou meio ansioso porque treinou bastante para cantar o hino
3109720 de jeito nenhum melhor voc perguntar de novo aos que disseram que ele renunciaria
3109721 mas a a gente se ama muito e tudo vai dar certo
3109722 a quest o das algemas apenas revela a ponta do iceberg de outras quest es ligadas dignidade da pessoa humana
3109723 estamos dizendo n o s que n o se deve colocar algemas mas que n o se deve fazer a exposi o desnecess ria de qualquer pessoa submetida autoridade estatal
3109724 a pris o em muitos casos s se justifica para fazer a imagem e a imagem com algema para expor na televis o
3109725 se depois se verificar que a pessoa foi presa indevidamente como em muitos casos j se verificou n o h sequer pedidos de desculpas formais muito menos a obriga o da rede de televis o de dizer que aquela pessoa foi presa indevidamente
3109726 quem h de reparar esses danos que s o grav ssimos e que na verdade s o irrepar veis
3109727 satisfaz se a sanha a curiosidade os desvios psicol gicos que todos eventualmente possam ter num dado momento sem que se resolvam os problemas
3109728 como se os tribunais especialmente as cortes superiores fossem condescendentes com o crime
3109729 n o se tratava como os senhores v em de um financista
3109730 abusos que se perpetram continuadamente j na pris o preventiva j na pris o provis ria j na execu o criminal
3109731 quem discute a coloca o das algemas n o quer a posi o de algemas nem em ricos nem em pobres
3109732 eu comecei a ligar para um monte de gente e as pessoas falavam comigo como se eu estivesse louca bem ele ainda n o ganhou e eu dizia ganhou sim porque j chegou at aqui acho que ele enche todo mundo de esperan a
3109733 o que me emociona que se barack obama ganhar as crian as v o poder dizer que um negro tamb m pode ser presidente
3109734 eu usaria sempre decotes em v e saltos baixos mesmo que o presidente fosse mais alto sen o fica sexy demais
3109735 uma campanha de guerra virtual feita pela r ssia est prejudicando seriamente muitos sites da ge rgia incluindo a p gina do minist rio das rela es exteriores
3109736 muitos sites do governo sa ram do ar desde o come o dos ataques hackers na sexta feira

3109738 os helic pteros encurralaram militantes em bajaur e mataram 50 deles

3109740 n o pode se preocupar com uma pesquisa e mudar sua pol tica econ mica
3109741 estou muito satisfeito com a redu o da infla o em praticamente todos os ndices de atacado e varejo significa que esse processo de alta das commodities produtos b sicos com cota o internacional como alimentos a o e petr leo est sendo revertido isso vai fazer com que a nossa infla o possa caminhar mais rapidamente para o centro da meta
3109742 isso queda da infla o n o significa que n s devemos agora descuidar dessa quest o o governo continuar empenhado em controlar a infla o porque ela sempre pode voltar e difundir a partir do que j aconteceu no passado
3109743 as for as russas est o ocupando gori as for as armadas georgianas receberam ordens de abandonar gori e de fortificar posi es pr ximo a mtsjeta para defender a capital uma ofensiva total
3109744 uma l stima que alguns de nossos aliados n o nos ajudem e tentem inclusive nos perturbar e com isso me refiro principalmente ao deslocamento do contingente militar da ge rgia no iraque para a zona de conflito oseta pelos estados unidos e seus avi es de transporte militar
3109745 parte significativa da opera o para for ar as autoridades georgianas a fazer paz com a oss tia do sul foi conclu da

3109752 we are mindful of global economic uncertainty and the challenging cost environment but barring unforeseen factors our current forecasts suggest another year of double digit earnings growth in 2009

3109765 i mean do you know how many pictures have been taken of me holding children in the last three years i mean it happens all the time
3109766 i think its amazing even as the mans coming clean that hes continuing to lie
3109767 that god will be there when you need him that i believe in a benevolent and merciful god that when things seem at their worst and their lowest he will always be there for you that no matter what you do he will forgive you and it is important to ask for his forgiveness its important in my case to have a personal relationship with the lord so that i pray daily and i feel that relationship all the time and when im faced with difficult decisions which i regularly am i very often go to him in prayer
3109768 i will say i dont want this to linger too much longer i should make my final decision pretty soon
3109769 whatever that is i want to make sure its 100 per cent sure
3109770 at the end of the year to be honest with you i didnt know if i was going to come back
3109771 i needed that time to really think about my future it was a tougher decision than i thought it was going to be at the end of the year
3109772 there are half a dozen different locations where the pot growers are dumping equipment and soil and its not just regular potting soil its laced with chemicals and pesticides they dumpers have to use rubber gloves to handle it and then they leave the gloves behind
3109773 not only does this stuff look bad it is not a healthy thing for the wild animals in the area they can get injured by this stuff
3109774 in the fall or early spring during the deer hunting season people are leaving carcasses ive also seen cows dropped off just left to rot or when people have pets die they just drop them off
3109775 if they get into the stream system there are some people in this area who actually take their water supply from the creek they could get really sick even die
3109776 ive seen everything tossed in the woods from kitchen sinks to old refrigerators and sofas its very frustrating
3109777 tree branches are not litter animal parts and carcasses are not litter litter is things like plastic bags and garbage
3109778 the litter act was designed for people throwing things out car windows more than anything if someone drives down the road and tosses a mcdonalds burger wrapper out the window that falls under the litter act i dont think when they made this legislation that it would would deal with people dumping garbage in the woods
3109779 we have to have something to investigate just saying there is someone dumping garbage wont help us depending on whats on our plate on a particular day it may not be a high enough priority to investigate
3109780 we will charge an individual and have in the past if there is sufficient evidence such as a license plate then we have the individual clean it up take it to the dump and bring a receipt to show that they dropped it off after which instead of taking court action we go by the way of writing a ticket the maximum ticket fine is 100
3109781 the cost of cleaning up illegal dump sites on public land is about 17 000 each year
3109782 thats down substantially from where it was about 10 years ago when we had a full time crew working five days a week cleaning up sites now we have a contractor who is responsible for this and basically works one day a week
3109783 this will be an excellent addition to the services we offer our small business community
3109784 bizpal will allow our entrepreneurs a more streamlined and simplified start up process

3109786 kelowna reported a total rainfall of 8 5 millimeters there was some intense lightning we were recording a lightning strike across the okanagan every three to five seconds
3109787 there were reports of hail up to 20 millimeters in diameter reported in the penticton area the penticton airport recorded total rainfall of 45 6 millimeters thats a lot of rain to come down in a short amount of time
3109788 on our arrival we found fire in the basement area of the building there was heat damage to the basement area which was used for book storage and an office area and smoke damage to the rest of the building there was no structural damage and only contents were affected
3109789 there was no one occupying the building it was used as a church office building
3109790 it meant so much to our family that our fellow kelowna residents came out to support connor and canadian blood services
3109791 my son would not be where he is today if not for the blood donated by generous canadians and for that we are truly grateful

3109800 the people ive been talking to are angry but theyre also afraid afraid to dissent and afraid to look powerless and foolish
3109801 the criminals who govern us have injured our earth damaged our republic put us in mortal danger and we go on as if everything were fine seemingly unaware of our dire situation
3109802 my conversations tell me that we are not unaware and that we are seething with repressed rage witnesses to an atrocity we turn away because we feel unable to act
3109803 and our biggest fear is not that any of the million or so terrorists out there will do us any harm but that we will be counted among them
3109804 and so we take off our shoes in the airport and buy newspapers that lie to us and pretend to support the troops and stay away from political gatherings of all kinds
3109805 its not that people are apathetic or complacent were damaged and discouraged
3109806 the two major political parties have been complicit in the racket and have furthered it by trashing the bill of rights undermining the rule of law and effectively repealing all checks on executive power
3109807 most recently our leaders have waged two wars to advance their political ends and lost both of them as all responsible authorities predicted they would
3109808 they have long since quit regulating the big anti national corporations that control public policy resulting in the widespread abuse of workers poor quality goods mass export of jobs declines in public health and happiness environmental pollution the concentration of wealth in a few hands and a failing economy
3109809 these problems cant be addressed until americans undertake the restoration of constitutional government

3109829 change is the only constant within the coastal system and happens at much faster rates than changes occurring on more stable inland terrains if we recognize the inevitability of change we can adjust our human activities to accommodate it by educating students now we hope to create citizens who will make smart science based decisions about our use of the islands
3109830 first to explore the islands with a team of scientists educators and students and then to create a curriculum document that would address the dynamic nature of the barrier islands and the forces that affect them
3109831 when students make careful observations at regular intervals they become more aware of the constant changes that occur in our coastal setting
3109832 because every citizen benefits directly or indirectly from wise management of our coastal resources

3109870 regarding the grave sin of abortion or euthanasia when a persons formal cooperation becomes manifest understood in the case of a catholic politician as his consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws his pastor should meet with him instructing him about the churchs teaching informing him that he is not to present himself for holy communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of sin and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the eucharist
3109871 when these precautionary measures have not had their effect or in which they were not possible and the person in question with obstinate persistence still presents himself to receive the holy eucharist the minister of holy communion must refuse to distribute it

3109893 the good lord is praying that were able to keep our car up front every week weve just been fortunate to run as well as we have at places and yet weve struggled at a couple others weve got some work to do
3109894 i heard earlier today that the 48 of jimmie johnson has been testing like 18 times this year and stuff and weve tested a couple places but nothing like that
3109895 weve got some tests lined up and were going to try to learn something and keep our mojo going and keep it going through and into the chase
3109896 it feels good to clinch a spot in the chase to begin with after three years
3109897 the 18 car has been through a lot since ive been there but you know like i say the 48 of johnson and the 9 of kasey kahne and those guys have picked up their game and i think weve got to get on top of it and weve got some stuff coming that were going to try at testing it feels good to go in on top but its a lot of work to stay there this team will dig down deep and i think that well be just fine but weve got to work hard to get there
3109898 theres still more opportunities for us to be able to win another one just to increase our point total for the start of the chase
3109899 candidates that live in glass houses should think about their own history before trying to clown their opponent about theirs

3109902 the fact that hes african american is a big deal i do expect and hope that hillary is the nominee of the party but i hope hes used in some way
3109903 if he happens to be the nominee of the party and ends up being president i think his capacity to influence in a positive way the behavior of a lot of underperforming black youth today is very important and hes the only one who can reach them
3109904 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee

3109965 the result is that the population seems more closely related to the african source population of the favored genes than it really is
