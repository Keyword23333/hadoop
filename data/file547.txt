5470014 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain

5470034 you cant do that what are you crazy cant ever happen
5470035 you can say its preseason and its going to be ok but i thought defensively we were poor
5470036 starting with the coaches myself and the people on that side of the ball
5470037 we put no pressure on the quarterback and missed assignments
5470038 im happy with the way this first game for him went
5470039 i was average at best but its a start and you have to start somewhere ill take a few four yard carries like i had tonight i ran with some toughness ive had to stay patient through the whole process rehab and im still trying to make all the effort over the last year pay off
5470040 we couldnt score in the red zone in the first half and over all we couldnt get off the field on third downs
5470041 bob and i think its so good that were going to try to get the league to approve to put us in preseason on a rotation basis then we can do this every year next year wed go to and the texans would come back here the next year the year after that
5470042 is too but theyre in our division so that wouldnt work houston is ideal for what we want to accomplish at a time like this weve got a lot of fans in the area we had a lot of them leave here after katrina and now theyre settled over there it would be a good thing for both teams

5470048 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognizing the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5470049 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5470050 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5470051 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5470052 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5470053 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5470054 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5470055 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5470056 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5470057 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people

5470081 the impact of foreign investment is being considered more and more by governments around the world
5470082 this has had an impact on omers in the past in one specific case related to our bid on a toll road in france
5470083 while our bid was competitive on price we lost the bid as a result of our not having a french partner
5470084 one of the reasons we are establishing omers worldwide is to grow our on the ground relationships with local partners across the globe to support our investment areas to bring successful deals to the table

5470095 the irrational exuberance that we saw earlier in the year has come out of this gold market
5470096 the focus on the dollar has real legs and there is a risk of further long liquidation of gold prices
5470097 if the commodity bubble hasnt truly burst and trends change again even then we have to look at a year of pause and breath catching before gold can continue higher
5470098 money is coming out of this sector the shift in asset allocation is perceptible

5470108 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5470109 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5470110 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5470111 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5470112 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5470113 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5470114 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5470115 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5470116 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5470117 on the other hand are the people of this country the business community and there too i dont see any new initiatives
5470118 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual

5470152 if they screw up in a building and they deliberately do things that are wrong in the building just to pocket money and people die because of it then people should be held accountable
5470153 i can tell you in my heart of hearts i dont believe anybody deliberately did anything to make that building less safe
5470154 were they derelict in their duty only time will tell in retrospect obviously one could have done more

5470161 at this time we have no idea how this man came to be situated within the womans vagina or what motivation he might have had for being there
5470162 his dazed state public defecating and lack of clothing suggest that he is a mentally ill homeless man who was seeking shelter yet its hard to believe that someone so feeble and mentally disturbed would be capable of such an intrusion we have not ruled out the possibility that he had help

5470219 the activity that resulted in this lawsuit is alleged to have begun in 2001 pre dating general dynamicss acquisition of the operations in june 2002

5470225 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5470226 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5470227 although the overall frequency of sleep insufficiency in children is unknown our studys prevalence of 26 percent may be under estimated due to the exclusion of children with known sleep disorders and other illnesses
5470228 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5470229 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5470230 these groups already are known to be at higher risk for hypertension and other adverse outcomes
5470231 their high prevalence of poor sleep quality and deprivation could be due to disruptive home environments and neighborhoods as well as unrecognized psychological and medical problems
5470232 meanwhile pediatricians should view sleep quality and patterns as an intervenable health concern
5470233 our data underscores the need to monitor quality and quantity of sleep as part of a childs overall health strategy

5470275 the increase in fuel prices is a major problem and we do not want the increase in these costs to show in the shelf prices of our products
5470276 we have successfully controlled the prices in the menu so as the rise will be below last years inflation and this years forecast of 8 and 10 respectively however the improvement of living standards in romania has lead to a change in our customers behaviour year after year this is why the average transaction is 22 higher than last year

5470291 small towns and regional markets are growing faster than the national average equally important there are significant lifestyle and aspirational changes happening in these areas
5470292 the next phase of growth and fragmentation is expected to take place in the individual regional state while in the south each state has more than ten local language channels west bengal maharashtra orissa and punjab have very limited regional options so in these markets the gestation period of any new channel will not be too much for example last year in maharashtra me marathi and zee talkies got launched both these channels have a considerable number of advertisers
5470293 many of our brands have national appeal while others are leaders in regional markets
5470294 we plan to launch regional channels in six cities in india with over 100 million investment over the next 12 months
5470295 we have been thinking about venturing into the regional channel space for quite sometime now however we are currently evaluating the right opportunity
5470296 there are certain ideas in the pipeline we did an internal research before launching 9xm the so called music channels were focused on reality shows fiction shows and other programmes
5470297 it was important for us that we keep our focus intact over the fact that we were a music channel
5470298 for those entering the regional space would say that the advertising pie would grow and those who would not venture into that space would say otherwise
5470299 with the growth of regional language channels there will be a number of local advertisers who will come on board and and advertising will get far more focused therefore one can expect that there will be some kind of an expansion in the advertising pie however whether the growth in advertising will be significant or not we will have to wait and see

5470307 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5470308 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5470309 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5470310 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better

5470331 este un pas normal in dezvoltarea companiei sa oferim clientilor credite si pentru alte scopuri ne gandim si la alte produse de finantare prin care credex sa devina un magazin de credite
5470332 avem in proiect emiterea de carduri pentru clienti la care sa fie asociat in curand si un cont credex

5470336 vom avea noi puncte si in reteaua altex si prin parteneriate dar nu vom avea si puncte independente pana la finalul anului deocamdata vom exploata portofoliul de clienti altex de altfel urmarim ca la finalul anului 25 din vanzarile altex sa fie realizate prin credit

5470343 unlike previous large scale operations there is no u s strategic or economic interest in the somalia deployments
5470344 but the nation 12 21 92 referred to somalia as

5470354 the view is that they would like everything to be settled before the deployment and our view is that we should proceed immediately with the monitors
5470355 a few specific examples include guitar hero world tours guitars and drums will work with rock band 2 and konamis rock revolution software and yes you guessed it rock band 2s guitar and drum set will work with guitar hero world tour and with rock revolution conversely rock revolutions drum set will work with both guitar hero world tour and rock band 2 in addition guitar hero world tour and rock band 2 will both support the singstar microphones

5470361 rezultatele aferente primului semestru din 2008 indica o piata a asigurarilor stabila si in continua dezvoltare fapt care in opinia mea reflecta inclusiv o incredere din ce in ce mai mare a consumatorilor de produse de asigurare
5470362 in ceea ce priveste structura pe clase se constata faptul ca asigurarile auto detin in continuare ponderea majoritara respectiv de 75 2 din total prime brute subscrise din asigurari generale
5470363 ponderile celorlalte clase de asigurari generale se situeaza la aproximativ aceleasi niveluri ca in semestrul i din 2007 cu exceptia clasei xiv asigurari de credite in cazul careia s a inregistrat o scadere a ponderii cu 5 6 puncte procentuale pana la 3 0 in semestrul i 2008
5470364 din totalul primelor brute subscrise din asigurari de viata in semestrul i 2008 un procent de 66 6 a fost generat de asigurarile traditionale clasa i iar un procent de 30 8 de catre asigurarile de viata si anuitati legate de investitii clasa iii se constata faptul ca in orizontul de timp analizat ponderea clasei i a crescut cu 3 1 puncte procentuale in timp ce ponderea clasei iii a scazut cu 3 6 puncte procentuale
5470365 pe termen scurt infuzia de capital din partea grupului mama ne a ajutat la cresterea cotei de piata insa cresterea de active s a datorat timing ului foarte bun in care am lansat fondurile de obligatiuni si monetare si fortei de distributie foarte puternice a grupului
5470366 vrem sa incheiem anul cu un volum de active in administrare mai mult decat dublu si pentru ca acest lucru sa se intample avem in plan ca in intervalul ramas pana la finalul anului sa ne concentram si pe segmentul fondurilor de actiuni
5470367 nu cred ca clasamentul administratorilor de fonduri va inregistra modificari spectaculoase pana la sfarsitul anului investitorii asteapta stirile pozitive despre piata si cresterile pentru a face plasamente in fonduri
5470368 fed ul este o institutie cu o credibilitate solida trebuie sa avem grija sa nu ne lansam in actiuni care ar afecta aceasta credibilitate
5470369 vor sa multumeasca congresul si pietele financiare insa acest lucru creeaza un precedent teribil
5470370 este mult mai greu sa spui nu cand ai creat un precedent
5470371 ne aflam intr un mediu nou iar banca centrala a trebuit sa faca ceva nou structura de reglementare trebuie sa se adapteze
5470372 trebuie sa se ia in calcul riscul ca jucatorii de pe piata sa priveasca in mod incorect fed ul ca sursa de sprijin neconditionat
5470373 apare pericolul ca masurile pe care fed ul trebuie sa le ia pentru a spori stabilitatea sa ajunga sa restranga cresterea economica
5470374 nu e de mirare ca nivelul lichiditatii se pastreaza in continuare scazut pe bursa pentru ca ne lipsesc investitorii nu are cine cumpara pentru ca interesul pentru bursa de la bucuresti este in scadere nu doar din cauza situatiei internationale ci si datorita faptului ca bursa noastra este mica lipsita de calitate

5470387 there was a general assumption that nuts and dried fruits would be included in this program they are considered to be healthy
5470388 students look forward to the fruits and vegetables offered and are starting to think more about a healthy diet

5470390 the withdrawal of russian forces to the positions they had held before hostilities broke out in line with the assurances i was given by president medvedev

5470405 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5470406 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant

5470600 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5470601 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5470602 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5470603 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5470604 this cannot be done using but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5470605 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words

5470640 those malicious psychopaths who take pleasure in harming others they harass and attack people with mean spirited blog postings they hide behind various screen names being the cowards that they are it gives them a false sense of safety hiding in the shadows like a frightened rat
5470641 unconscionable and deceptive business practices relating to an advertising campaign

5470645 it was definitely a pro job the locks were drilled out and the van was cleaned out of all of its contents
5470646 they dont care about prosecuting anybody they just would like their personal belongings back
5470647 whoever did this they can email the bands website and drop the items somewhere and well pick them up no questions asked we dont care about the ipods or other items that can be replaced its the personal items and the laptops they would really like back
5470648 for years the discussion has been dominated by people with a political and or a social agenda noted robert king
5470649 but the academic analysis shows the data cannot be used to prove the racial profiling allegations ironically an objective analysis of the data actually proves that portland police officers do not engage in racial profiling i hope people are willing to listen to the facts if they do they will understand we do not stop anyone because of their race we only stop people on the basis of their behavior
5470650 the fact that they could hire a woman with such a deplorable record is in keeping with dhs pattern of incompetence overall
5470651 i am optimistic about people but pessimistic about world views
5470652 i wanted movement and not a calm course of existence i wanted excitement and danger and the chance to sacrifice myself for my love i felt myself in a superabundance of energy which found no outlet in our quiet life

5470661 i do think its fair to say that in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well anymore its becoming increasingly dysfunctional
5470662 i have dreamed of being a hero of one of the games maybe winning the world series eventually but not such a great game all along
5470663 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5470664 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5470665 in hindsight i played perfectly into the hands of monckton and his happy radio host roy green who share the same goal not to win an argument about global warming science but merely to show that there still is an argument
5470666 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5470667 this is the first study to comprehensively look at a large population of infected persons to study the long term effects of west nile virus
5470668 we found that both physical and mental functions as well as mood and fatigue seemed to return to normal in about one year
5470669 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems

5470675 unlike illicit drug use which shows a continuing downward trend prescription drug abuse has seen a continual rise through the 1990s and has remained stubbornly steady during recent years

5470680 if development continues beyond the mind via meditative disciplines or in some instances psychedelically induced mystical experience then the eye of contemplation opens and discloses the world of soul and spirit of subtle energies and insights of radical intuition and transcendental illumination

5470690 were sorry but the head you are calling has been disconnected
5470691 obamas granny has selected the vp she will announce this afternoon at 5 00 pm eastern time
5470692 but i see that r james woolsey a former director of the c i a serves on the board of american congress for truth your educational foundation
5470693 if you are worried about death threats why would you put a glamorous photograph of yourself on the cover of your new book
5470694 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5470695 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5470696 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5470697 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5470698 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5470699 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5470700 hmmm we realize that someone cannot mention everything in one column so that these are selected things that professor clayson has learned i am sorry that he has chosen to publish such negative stuff since there is a lot more to learn
5470701 i would just like to mention that calling those holding an opposing view stupid is nothing new
5470702 mccain is still considered the republican candidate for president while edwards is not
5470703 i have heard over and over again about mccains affair what channel are you watching i think it is one of the only things the democrats have that and showing pics over and over of mccain with bush as if because he took a pic with him he is just like him
5470704 jeroze doyou read anything other than left wing talking points
5470705 the polls are tied yet i cant find anything reporting that bit of info here or on the national sites why
5470706 what does it matter if mccain had an affair its common knowledge that obama had an affair as well
5470707 today prof clayson denounces the press for its religious reverence to obama he then tries to prove it by providing three examples
5470708 the bat thinkaboutit and mister t have apparently been living on the moon for a while and have been out of touch with events here on earth the fact that john mccain was fooling around with cindy while he was still married to carol is something that he admits
5470709 jeroze you are right on mccains affair i did not see the entire saddle back event i was watching the swimming
5470710 cross you kill me every week i cant help but think you read a different article than me each week because your generalizations of claysons intent and meaning behind is writing seams to be much different than what i read
5470711 i dont get it the title says it all now liberals everywhere are trying to say clayson did not learn these things
5470712 cire asks what does it matter if mccain had an affair
5470713 cross is your goal to be insulting to people because if it is you are surely reaching your goals
5470714 sorry cire i wont take you seriously anymore and please dont take what i just wrote seriously
5470715 if you watched that youtube video and thought they were being serious im beyond concerned
5470716 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5470717 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5470718 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5470719 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5470720 i could hear the bubbling of my skin as the flames kissed it
5470721 the sibilant sermons of the snake as she discoursed upon the disposition of my sinners soul seemed ceaseless
5470722 he served 22 years with great vision and integrity and all who love wake forest are grateful for his legacy of achievement and the place the institution holds in american higher education
5470723 jonesy put your head down and skate the improbable nhl career of keith jones
5470724 bloggers falling into the same trap as those they once hilariously and correctly lampooned
5470725 emphasised the huge gap between the real technology revolution and what the countrys leaders appear to know about it
5470726 take a more serious approach to the changes technology is bringing to our society

5470735 all the languages of heteroglossia are specific points of view on the world forms for conceptualizing the world in words specificworldviews each characterized by its own objects meanings and values bakhtin
5470736 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5470737 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5470738 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5470739 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5470740 he was obviously uncomfortable and we were uncomfortable you cant just develop policy on the spot so not knowing who this person was i had no idea what his standards were and i think we certainly had the discretion to ask him to leave
5470741 im an independent reporter who does original research and has a record of being credentialed
5470742 i dont think theres any question im a member of the media
5470743 sign whatever it is the favored members of the media have to sign swear to whatever they have to swear to
5470744 i think what were looking at is a tycoon team if you will people with the resources and vision for a new energy economy
5470745 its time for the wealthiest of the country to lead in solving the carbon crisis
5470746 if they can come together on climate change and pool their intellectual resources their financial resources and their own teams of people they have managing their empires what a critical mass that would be and what a voice it would be
5470747 this is a combination of a symposium and a renewable energy street fair and multimedia presentation
5470748 its a fabulous concentration most venues dont bring all of that together
5470749 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5470750 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5470751 a troop increase is likely to inflame afghan nationalism because afghans are more anti foreign than we acknowledge and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining
5470752 americans need to get over the political bigotry that there are only two parties
5470753 must be astonishing to canadians who have a multiparty system
5470754 mainstream political parties can essentially cooperate in failing to even attempt to solve problems faced by a majority of citizens usually because they have been funded and supported in other ways by large corporations
5470755 naders presidential campaign as with other similar past campaigns by independents and third parties serve the purpose of educating people about the huge gaps in the mainstream parties platforms
5470756 not stupid theyve developed a highly proficient way of censoring themselves
5470757 until these loopholes are closed you will continue to see regular dishonest unethical secretive unrepresentative and wasteful actions by governments and corporations
5470758 hello americans cut the crap stop making excuses and take over
5470759 protest the corporate control over our political system and to call for opening the presidential debates
5470760 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5470761 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5470762 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5470763 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5470764 if they would only let her into the debates and stand on the same stage with all the leaders people would be able to compare and see that for themselves
5470765 to some degree these people can be role models in terms of showing our current students that they have a lot of opportunities to advance
5470766 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
5470767 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5470768 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5470769 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5470770 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5470771 efforts to build and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5470772 to go from a small town like taunton and go to america and do all the research he does especially this as part of the nobel peace prize is a great achievement
5470773 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
5470774 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
5470775 oh yea obama likes his coffee with some milk in it from what i hear
5470776 where dallas elite go to cool their heels in the heat of summer
5470777 i was pretty surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous
5470778 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5470779 but im sure that team owner joe and j d gibbs team president will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think and were going to just keep working on our stuff
5470780 this sort of thing in manipulating horsepower is prevalent in the garage
5470781 its not unknown we had one of our truck series drivers ask us a couple of years ago why arent you doing this because we always did it with our previous manufacturer
5470782 i can understand because of the personal way a team would take the penalty that was without question directed toward them at jgr not the brand they were penalized before indy for overachievement
5470783 we dont condone it its not allowed in the rules
5470784 we have seen instances throughout the last couple of years where teams were found to be doing things in postrace inspection which were obvious attempts to affect the performance of the car during the race
5470785 to me that is a blatant attempt to affect the outcome of the event this was not an attempt to affect the outcome of the event
5470786 this was an attempt to somehow keep to themselves in my opinion without even knowing what was actually done it appears to be an attempt to keep their hands around some product of their effort and their hard work and it wasnt the right thing to do
5470787 i was present when the restrictor was created between nascar and the manufacturers for the truck and the nationwide series the restrictor cuts the horsepower by 150 horsepower from the potential of the engines and 1 000 rpm that limits the peak power for the nationwide and the truck series
5470788 d gale al comandante de la polic a que se atenga a las consecuencias pero no voy a permitir que esa polic a ataque al pueblo de gu rico ni al gobierno nacional

5470792 hay muchos que llegan a alcaldes y gobernadores y se olvidaron de la revoluci n y van a hacer lo m nimo arreglar la carretera a tapar un hueco all arreglar el agua eso es bueno pero
5470793 por qu raz n si nosotros estamos exonerando del pago a los productores del pago de maquinaria el precio del producto no baja esa pregunta es interesante sabes porque no baja el as porque lo que reina en esto por todo esto es el metabolismo del capitalismo y eso debemos tenerlo claro todos nosotros
5470794 hay que construir el socialismo hay que apurar la marcha
5470795 el capitalismo es perverso y est acabando con el mundo
5470796 this is a gorgeous venue and i can just envision some really great shows here
5470797 we do this same show in hollywood too but in hollywood dane cook or jamie kennedy could come out and people are like eh they see that kind of thing a lot but the crowds in orange county just seem to appreciate it a lot more and seem to have way more fun with it
5470798 tell me if this is a woman or a little kid they cry for no reason fall down a lot wake up in the middle of the night because they had a nightmare and occasionally call you daddy
5470799 the quickest way to get out of a phone call is to ask what time it is loudly repeat the time back and then just hang up
5470800 a mustache tells the world dont trust me around your kids
5470801 im a man and i like beer and whiskey but you also know what i like the taste of strawberries
5470802 someone said look at this rich bleep and slashed my bike seat
5470803 why do gay guys always look like they just smelled cookies
5470804 do we really trust the judgment of the american people
5470805 never throw a tank top over a light bulb to create mood lighting
5470806 the music seriously 80s rotation is still heavy in my ipod
5470807 make sure the plant upholds basic standards of kashrut and worker and animal treatment and that it is in full compliance with the laws of the united states
5470808 regardless of the allegations the food is kosher thats whats important
5470809 were in a bit of an eco mess but weve got the brains to lick any problem and thats why ecogeek org publishes up to ten stories daily about innovations that are saving the planet and if that sounds interesting to you then congratulations youre an ecogeek
5470810 that the tools models and ideas for building a better future lie all around us
5470811 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
5470812 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
5470813 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
5470814 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
5470815 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
5470816 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a 1 in 3 chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
5470817 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
5470818 its kind of a weird process if you stop and think about it
5470819 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
5470820 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
5470821 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5470822 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5470823 we had a heart to heart regarding our friendship versus business we both believed we could manage both and that our friendship would not get in the way
5470824 weve been friends for eight years and never thought about getting into business with each other but this presented the right opportunity with the market timing our passion for doing something good randys sales and marketing experience and my technical and construction abilities we figured it was a natural fit
5470825 we want the clean solar team to stay abreast of the latest advancements in technology maintain certifications and educate ourselves in order to provide our customers with the knowledge they need as a solar owner
5470826 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5470827 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5470828 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5470829 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5470830 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5470831 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5470832 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5470833 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5470834 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5470835 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5470836 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5470837 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5470838 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5470839 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5470840 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5470841 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
5470842 10 6 gw the generation capacity of the six plants x 7884 hours of generation per year assuming 90 operational 83 57 twh y 83 57 twh y x 0 65 54 mt co2 y
5470843 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5470844 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5470845 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5470846 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5470847 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5470848 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5470849 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5470850 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5470851 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5470852 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5470853 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5470854 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5470855 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5470856 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5470857 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5470858 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5470859 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5470860 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5470861 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5470862 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5470863 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5470864 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5470865 since man lives by the permission of physical geography it is his fate to be divided by mountains rivers and seas into groups that develop in semi isolation their diverging languages and creeds their climatically conditioned features customs and dress

5470869 this is an occasion where we have two suites actually one inside the track and one outside that we celebrate with our customers and employees weve got about 3 000 employees in the area that work on prototype cars for all the manufacturers and we have a great time with that
5470870 its really home for me its a chance to play in front of the home crowd it means a lot to ford motor co it means a lot to me
5470871 it wouldve been a long plane ride home if the other manufacturer wouldve got in victory lane
5470872 but its good to see all the ford fans and jack roush and everybody excited that was a good weekend for those guys and a good day for everybody i think we all were pretty close to the top 10 and i dont know what it is about this place but we all seem to run well and have good speed the cars run good so it was a good day for the whole organization
5470873 theres a lot of credit for a track like this that needs to go to doug yates and the engine guys
5470874 they did a great job with the engine right now were still running stuff that is fundamentally the same as a production which nobody else is and for those guys to be able to prepare the engine and develop it and keep it competitive through the all things that have been developed by all the other manufacturers its just a real incredible feat
5470875 we probably put a little more effort into this race than some of the others
5470876 maybe we take a few more chances and really get pumped up a little bit more being that theres such a presence of ford racing people here and a lot of jacks employees and familys up here
5470877 we dont anything out of the box we just always are making sure that we cross our ts and dot our is when we come up to michigan because it is an important race for our team owner and its fun to see him happy when we leave here michigan

5470882 this fugitive was truly a menace to society and the community is a much safer place with him in custody i applaud the efforts of all of our task force officers for working so diligently to bring this fugitive to justice
5470883 the lone star fugitive task forces success is measured by the collective efforts of our law enforcement partners cornelius robinson will be assured of his day in court
5470884 this case exemplifies the tireless efforts of our agency in taking alleged sexual predators off the streets before they can affect another childs life

5470907 i am a talentless observer who cant have fun listening to music without being a hater
5470908 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5470909 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5470910 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5470911 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5470912 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5470913 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5470914 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5470915 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5470916 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5470917 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5470918 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5470919 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5470920 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5470921 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5470922 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5470923 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5470924 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5470925 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5470926 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5470927 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5470928 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5470929 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5470930 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5470931 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5470932 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5470933 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5470934 get it off the air and i really mean it
5470935 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5470936 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5470937 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5470938 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5470939 i am married to the next president of the united states
5470940 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5470941 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5470942 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5470943 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5470944 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5470945 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5470946 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5470947 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5470948 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5470949 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5470950 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5470951 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5470952 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5470953 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5470954 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5470955 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5470956 they have to be careful sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5470957 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5470958 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5470959 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5470960 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5470961 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5470962 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5470963 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5470964 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5470965 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5470966 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5470967 bitterly clinging to their religion guns and antithapy towards others
5470968 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5470969 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5470970 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5470971 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5470972 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5470973 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5470974 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5470975 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5470976 students need to comprehend that it is lack of judgment not only lack of skill that increases the risk of injury to one s self and others
5470977 in essence the judge appears to conclude that fox retained distribution rights in watchmen through the 1991 largo quitclaim and he concludes that under the 1994 turnaround producer larry gordon acquired an option to acquire foxs remaining interest in watchmen that was never exercised thereby leaving fox with its rights under the 1994 agreement
5470978 while the judges opinion is preliminary and his views could change in the course of the litigation his current take on the facts is consistent with our position
5470979 we dont know why we had so many arrests on this particular sting
5470980 actually weve seen a marked decrease in street level prostitution so its hard to tell if that just happened to be a night that people were out looking for that particular service or if other factors were involved
5470981 the direction for the public is that this is not an either or decision
5470982 for a growing number of consumers its not that theyre saying the web is here im going to turn off the tv theyre going to add to their sources that may cut into their time there are only so many hours in the day but it doesnt mean eschewing the traditional sources of news
5470983 the established news brands will continue to be the brands that attract the publics attention
5470984 i would say theres a direct correlation between how long someones been in the business and that persons willingness to adapt
5470985 this means people really want our information we just have to keep up with how they want it it means they cant be platform centric the way they used to be for people to think the audience desire for news is going away this flies right in the face of that
5470986 its a terrific time for journalists to take their career into their own hands its always been a very passive career you move up from market to market and you dont have to retrain yourself but if you take the time to retrain if you learn the new skills and its not a matter of new skills for journalism those rules stay the same you throw yourself to the front of the pack

5471010 ninety years after survivors encountered the 1918 pandemic influenza virus we collected antibody producing b cells from them and successfully isolated b cells that produce antibodies that block the viral infection
5471011 the antibodies produced by these cells demonstrated remarkable power to block 1918 flu virus infection in mice proving that even nine decades after infection with this virus survivors retain protection from it
5471012 our findings show that survivors of the pandemic have highly effective virus neutralising antibodies to this powerful virus and humans can sustain circulating b memory cells to viruses for up to nine decades after exposure
5471013 the first truly revolutionary black film presented to us by a black man
5471014 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5471015 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5471016 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5471017 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable

5471019 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

5471023 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5471024 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5471050 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5471051 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5471052 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5471053 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5471054 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5471055 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5471056 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5471057 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5471058 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5471059 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5471060 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5471061 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud

5471063 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
5471064 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
5471065 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee

5471076 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries

5471079 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
5471080 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree

5471089 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5471090 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5471091 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5471092 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5471093 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter

5471099 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5471100 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her

5471106 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5471107 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5471108 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5471109 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5471110 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5471111 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5471112 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5471113 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5471114 i have serious sadness over two things in the congress
5471115 i know its the two biggest issues that youre concerned about but 107 days until the election maybe its 106 by now and things will be better
5471116 this will not happen without the election of barack obama as president of the united states

5471118 proposing to get a little increase in oil driiling for fuel to be sold to china 10 to 15 years from now as a solution to our rising gasoline prices makes about as much sense as responding to an attack from afghanistan by invading some other country
5471119 the highest and best thing for me to do is to focus on trying to enlarge the political space in which elected officials address the climate crisis i m devoting my life to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines that supports the truly massive policy change we need to have

5471131 the announcement by president musharraf that he is standing down as president brings to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5471132 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential for britains security never mind the personal ties that bind nearly one million british people to pakistan that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thoroughgoing reform of its social political and economic structures
5471133 in this context the musharraf years yielded significant dividends notably in the economic field but also until last autumn in areas like media freedom it is important to highlight president musharrafs commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5471134 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5471135 the responsibilities on political leaders in pakistan are now significant they need to come together to ensure that the recently elected government carries forward an economic and security agenda consistent with the long term interests of the pakistani people
5471136 the uk will remain strongly committed to its partnership with the pakistani people notably through our aid programme
5471137 i look forward to the early election of a new president in pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together
5471138 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5471139 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5471140 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5471141 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5471142 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5471143 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5471144 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5471145 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives

5471156 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

5471159 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh

5471161 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5471162 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5471163 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5471164 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5471165 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5471166 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5471167 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5471168 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world

5471223 aabid khan was very much the mr fix it of the group
5471224 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5471225 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaida and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5471226 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems

5471228 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim

5471260 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5471261 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5471262 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5471263 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5471264 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5471265 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5471266 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5471267 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5471268 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation

5471272 we could leave here in two minutes but weve had no orders to pull out
5471273 practically speaking there are so far no signs of withdrawal at all what theyre trying to do is to widen their territorial presence
5471274 they have pretty much unrestricted freedom of action they are trying to show us they are masters on the ground right now
5471275 i might be naive but im still hopeful that a very strong common effort by europe and the united states will be effective in the withdrawing of russian troops from territory of georgia
5471276 according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun

5471283 the commitment of this party was not that we would have no taxes for telus it was not that we would have no taxes for bce it was not that we would have no taxes for foreign investors or no taxes for major corporations it was a commitment to protect the income of seniors

5471287 we owe it to the victims to not allow inmates to continue to run their enterprises from behind our bars
5471288 inmates can make calls and conduct criminal enterprises from a cell phone if we dont try to limit that
5471289 the cell phones are utilized to go around get unrestricted access to the community and thats not a good thing things can occur bad things can occur that way
5471290 such a show of violence is pushing kashmiri people especially our youth toward revolution
5471291 at this point i think the international community has to step in otherwise we fear a growing extremism this kind of anger comes at the worst time
5471292 pakistan has to put its political house in order before we can say what it means for kashmir
5471293 by the end of the day if the weather cooperates we can probably get all of our tourists out of there
5471294 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5471295 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5471296 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side

5471306 oh cedric i cant believe you are dead oh cedric now youre in twilight instead oh cedric vampires are no fun to haunt oh but edward you can bite me if you want
5471307 five years ago when we were first starting out wed autograph shirts and say start your own band about books
5471308 we just wanted to present a different idea of what a band could be
5471309 we wanted to play music that you wouldnt normally see on the tv or the radio
5471310 we werent thinking we would create a wizard rock movement it just evolved
5471311 but its cool to see bands about books realized in some way
5471312 some people dont like twilight potentially becoming the new harry potter theres a lot of groaning and moaning about the movie coming out and the fact that there is twilight music kind of bothers some people
5471313 twilight is sort of like the hannah montana of literature
5471314 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5471315 love is never going to get old and if you can find new ways to talk about love you can find new ways to write about twilight but i dont think twilight is as powerful as harry potter is twilight is about love and being a teenager and wondering if you fit in and harry potter is that and so much more
5471316 for us its a community not so much a genre of music and i dont know if they have a community yet if they all get together if the bands are as close as all of us are
5471317 i dont think it could have a movement on its own
5471318 but wizard rock can expand to be bands themed about other books it doesnt just have to be about harry potter anyone who is singing about any book can be part of wizard rock
5471319 excused from such performance from and after july 4 2008 pursuant to california labor code sec 2855 a

5471321 emis relationship with 30 seconds to mars has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company
5471322 the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of 3 million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fanbase however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emis investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success
5471323 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5471324 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5471325 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5471326 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here
5471327 the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt
5471328 so we have lost many of the people that were near and dear to us at virgin emi and crucial to the success of 30 seconds to mars a few of the great ones are still there but it is hardly the same company we have known

5471333 xde offers consumers a simple solution to add on to their hdtv purchase xde works with existing dvds to deliver a near hd experience with enhanced detail and richer colors toshiba is delivering to consumers what they want a high quality experience at an affordable price
5471334 after toshibas hd dvd finally phased itself out and we noted that blu ray was the clear winner we saw a lot of consumers who were saying whens the right time for me to buy
5471335 were at 1080p now and thats going to continue to go up with educated consumers one of the main reasons the sony ps3 blu ray player is so interesting is that it can be updated with software so as new standards come out theyll be able to update their ps3 blu ray player with software so that its consistent with whats available on the market at the highest levels
5471336 how great you are o sovereign lord there is no one like you and there is no god but you

5471338 the idea of trying to utilize the white spaces from a consumer perspective would be a good win for everyone
5471339 google has a clear business interest in expanding access to the web theres no doubt that if these airwaves are opened up to unlicensed use more people will be using the internet thats certainly good for google not to mention many of our industry peers but we also think that its good for consumers
5471340 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money

5471343 were funded by venture capital theyre not going to chase a company whose business model has been broken so if it doesnt feel like its headed towards a solution were done
5471344 internet dating was quite a good way of meeting fellas because they werent available anywhere else
5471345 i met quite a lot of interesting guys and it helped me decide what i did and didnt want from a relationship
5471346 i didnt meet anybody i thought was really weird they were fairly nice guys but i was careful to meet in a public place and tell people where i was going
5471347 i never put myself in any danger and the guys were normal to a certain degree they just didnt suit me
5471348 then i got this really nice email from a guy who looked normal there wasnt any weirdness and we liked talking about the same sort of things
5471349 i think you can find somebody if youre careful and do it right but i do worry about young girls who get themselves into tricky situations and perhaps arent old enough or wise enough to get themselves out of it
5471350 you can tell they arent online in the evenings they dont want to meet anywhere public and that sort of thing
5471351 i wasnt really into going to pubs and clubs and none of my friends had any eligible single guys for me i had a few workmates at the time who were having a go on the internet and i thought what have i got to lose
5471352 if i thought they sounded interesting i sent them a hi message and something most women dont seem to do i was keen to meet them quite quickly
5471353 i wasnt into the whole chatting online forever because my theory was worst case scenario we meet and dont hit it off i still have an ok sort of date get to meet someone new have a nice meal and nice conversation
5471354 i dont believe theres any way the virtual world can really represent who someone really is
5471355 no one turned up and went ew yuck how revolting
5471356 because im not a skinny person i would always make that really clear i didnt think there was any point in lying or misrepresenting myself
5471357 it was a nice photo but i thought it made him look really intellectual and really deep
5471358 we just talked the whole night we went to the lido restaurant for dinner and they started packing up around us so we had to leave then we went to midnight espresso cafe and spent ages there talking so we were out for quite a few hours
5471359 eventually he dropped me home and didnt give me a kiss goodnight but within a couple of days we met up again and had a picnic together which was really awesome
5471360 we have always decided that our anniversary is the day we met
5471361 tall average looking but nice and kind we arranged to meet tall average and nice was actually a smelly dwarf with an attitude problem
5471362 i was up at 3 45 a m because i couldnt sleep i was so excited
5471363 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
5471364 oh my we were clapping and jumping up and down when she won bronze its great just the fact she was good enough to go to the olympics but its even better she brought home a medal
5471365 she said she put her best foot forward and it paid off she was so excited
5471366 they have to be so careful with their weight so she couldnt wait to celebrate with ice cream
5471367 the only way to get the water out of the valley next to the highway is through pumps and hoses going across the road and every time a car passes over it stops the flow
5471368 its just a matter of getting it cleared out so the rain thats coming throughout this evening and overnight can flow freely and not cause any further trouble
5471369 if we can get those opened up itll greatly diminish the amount of water up there

5471371 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5471372 it was approximately two miles from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft
5471373 we noticed it was flying low and literally within a split second we saw a light aircraft come in from the right
5471374 the twin engined aircraft struck the light aircraft and just totally destroyed it
5471375 fighting to become part of the system here in england the traditions and what not though as the show progresses he slowly starts to understand them and embraces them
5471376 booth at first hates it but then he kind of turns around
5471377 thats when our show is the best when people have to reveal their feelings in some way but we never get sentimental
5471378 hepburn and tracy kind of thing the witty stylish fond but confrontational relationship of brennan and booth
5471379 i think going into season four this should be the mark of what our show is you put these two characters in a misplaced environment thats where they operate best thats what brings out the best in their relationship
5471380 we are getting very good production value weve shot in places you cant believe we shot in front of the tower bridge i thought it would be just a distant thing but its this close

5471383 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5471384 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5471385 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5471386 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5471387 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5471388 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5471389 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one
5471390 todo esto es mentira porque estas ideas se las inventan creativos psicop ticos del sector publicitario
5471391 hace siete a os usted como ex gur de la publicidad francesa habl en su novela 99 francs en espa a
5471392 pero si la publicidad sigue siendo hoy agresiva vulgar desprecia a las personas es sexista la cr tica que muestra mi libro y ahora la pel cula es muy actual nosotros los creativos nos ve amos entonces como artistas geniales viv amos en la embriaguez y de forma muy poco sana hoy la situaci n es a n peor los publicitarios son m s lisos as pticos pero no son tan vistosos ya no son artistas sino simples industriales la publicidad no tiene escr pulos a los publicitarios se les paga exclusivamente para que mientan y seduzcan

5471394 cleaning berber carpet to remove dust mites and remove allergins
5471395 the direction for the public is that this is not an either or decision
5471396 for a growing number of consumers its not that theyre saying the web is here im going to turn off the tv theyre going to add to their sources that may cut into their time there are only so many hours in the day but it doesnt mean eschewing the traditional sources of news
5471397 the established news brands will continue to be the brands that attract the publics attention
5471398 i would say theres a direct correlation between how long someones been in the business and that persons willingness to adapt
5471399 this means people really want our information we just have to keep up with how they want it it means they cant be platform centric the way they used to be for people to think the audience desire for news is going away this flies right in the face of that
5471400 its a terrific time for journalists to take their career into their own hands its always been a very passive career you move up from market to market and you dont have to retrain yourself but if you take the time to retrain if you learn the new skills and its not a matter of new skills for journalism those rules stay the same you throw yourself to the front of the pack

5471403 its 1 3 billion people and im telling you that they are moving fast you think that canada is very important in the world i remember when i was going to china the press saying mr chr tien you have to tell the president of china to do this and do that
5471404 you want me to the tell the president of a country of 1 3 billion people you should do this and do that but i dont dare to say what to do to the premier of saskatchewan you have to put things in perspective
5471405 we are at the bottom of the ladder in terms of having any influence with china
5471406 some people who say i never mentioned human rights they are completely wrong

5471411 lightning is not a big deal if youve coached in the southeast but its obviously a much bigger deal here
5471412 in georgia or texas if there is lightning you keep on practicing until it gets real close when it hit near dt jermaine jacobs today they thought it was close enough that everybody ran off the field it hit behind the goal post it was probably 25 yards away and that was it

5471424 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5471425 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5471426 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder

5471445 we would probably wait and see what ukraines response is what the eu u s and natos response is then we would try to draw up a new balance sheet which takes these things into consideration

5471452 the clone wars does not add anything to that epic
5471453 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5471454 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5471455 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5471456 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5471457 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5471458 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5471459 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one
5471460 it was a great movie and really got me stuck into it maybe there was a bit too much violence but apart from that great i loved the actors and the won
5471461 the saturn 12 footer i bought from you is the most fun boat weve ever had over the last 35 years it turns heads every time were out on the water with it and folks always stop for a closer look at the boat ramp and ask a lot of questions about it another great thing to mention is how easy it is to paddle the boat in either direction it just glides across the water i also bought a 9 8 nissan four stroke for this boat and swear you couldnt burn 3 gallons of gas in it in an entire day had to take it out in the ocean just to try it out and it was more fun then i could ever imagine completely safe and super stable big boat wakes in the intercostals waterway are a snap with this boat ran it once with just my 210 lbs in it and it was scary fast lol with the wife and i in it it runs about 16 18 knots at full plane using half throttle really and exceptional boat

5471468 i think people who are depressed especially those on anti depressants should be aware of this if they are driving or doing anything that relies on concentration and reaction skills
5471469 assessments are done on a case by case basis we would urge anyone who feels their driving is impaired by a medical condition to contact us
5471470 depression can affect people in many different ways but one of the common symptoms is experiencing difficulty concentrating

5471479 near term demand for hot roles in it will be driven by the need for local and cross discipline knowledge changes in technology greater emphasis on managing risk and the enterprise and a limited supply of key roles
5471480 nearly all organizations now see the need to integrate information across the entire organization
5471481 security roles have increased in importance as security expands to include risk management and requires an approach that considers applications infrastructure facilities and business factors
5471482 these roles deal with processes technology and vendors at the enterprise level and individuals with this experience are rare

5471486 conclusively show that spectrum sensing white space devices will cause harmfulinterference to wireless microphones during live events
5471487 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
5471488 an occurrence that takes place multiple times during any nfl game
5471489 the device did not operate in terms of transmitting a signal because it found that particular channel was occupied
5471490 there would be zero chance of causing any interference to the signals because in that situation there certainly would not be a transmission of the signal in the first place

5471540 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5471541 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5471551 well hes promoting what i would term a government takeover of the health system
5471552 he has said he wants to mandate free college tuition for every student in america
5471553 unlike ted kennedy he meant jack kennedy of course who said dont ask what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country he obama says were the wealthiest country in the world you should get this you should get that youre entitled to this youre entitled to that to me thats a move toward socialism
5471554 im familiar with what his work was here at the state capitol and to me the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior
5471555 and he has supported what i would consider to be socialistic moves on health care as a state senator
5471556 the expansion of the schip program represents a truly common sense and bipartisan solution that is plaguing many families especially those in our ninth congressional district

5471570 to make sure that the virus that causes smallpox would remain in storage awaiting a new opportunity to terrorize the world for decades both countries stored it distributed it to various research labs and otherwise ensured that this public health victory would be turned into a potential human tragedy

5471579 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
5471580 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
5471581 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
5471582 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
5471583 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
5471584 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5471586 this would include levies that would provide up to a 500 year level of protection
5471587 all too often it seems like if the market makes a move at 11 am or whatever someone appears to just go to a newswire and pick one story that came out right before that and just declares causality but theres another factor at play too imho strict observance of the sacred narrative if the narrative is that the market moves inverse to oil despite evidence that there is not a particularly strong correlation then any time a market drop coincides with an oil pop bam we have our market driver of the day

5471632 we realize that we made a sacrifice to come out here and part of it is our bodies need to sleep
5471633 this is what we signed up for lets go do whatever it takes to get it if it takes leaving the arena at one in the morning to get the gold medal well do it to get the gold medal
5471634 for 40 minutes we want to be nonstop movement and chaos
5471635 thats what we try to do we wreck havoc every time down were all over the point guards our big men are up were not relaxing
5471636 you will see a team of professionals in the olympics again
5471637 but i dont think youll see another team quite like this
5471638 my client was not under arrest he had not participated in any criminal acts and according to the allegheny county district attorneys office he was not about to be arrested for any reason
5471639 therefore the question remains how can a man die in the custody of the police when he is not the suspect of any criminal activity
5471640 it is our intention to show at trial that mr nugent caused the death of baron pikes by tasing him multiple times unnecessarily and in violation of louisiana law and by failing to get him medical attention when it was apparent he needed it
5471641 in a civilized society abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated
5471642 whereas recently in philadelphia and other cities officials have condemned and even charged police officers caught using excessive force against civilians here in pittsburgh high ranking officials all immediately made excuses for the police they should at least wait for all the facts
5471643 swissvale should put a moratorium on use of tasers until theres a policy
5471644 attacked struck kicked punched bludgeoned beat repeatedly shocked him with a taser
5471645 we expect our officers to use some degree of judgment and discretion on the street
5471646 police thought he was dangerous how dangerous to whom in order to know if its ok to have used an electroshock weapon on a person you have to know what kind of danger this person posed you use the amount of force to meet the danger presented
5471647 if the guy is using fists youre one step ahead you use pepper spray but its messy it can get in your eyes you could use your night stick or metal baton but thats going to open some wounds up if the persons bigger than you and you shoot them you could kill them if you use the taser it will put them down in a heartbeat
5471648 police use it as a weapon of first choice thats the pattern weve noticed
5471649 i think we had to do something to be fair to the team and to be fair to olson trembley said
5471650 apparently obama can do no better than to recycle discredited statements of harry reid when it comes to justice thomas like other liberal elites obama cannot stand it when a black man strays from the ideological plantation and refuses to implement liberal policies through the courts but obama will never point out any intellectual deficiencies in justice thomass work because he cant justice thomass opinions consistently reveal faithfulness to the constitution judicial modesty and deference to the will of the people in our representative democracy that is opposed to everything that obama and the liberals are trying to do in grabbing power from the people and giving it to the courts
5471651 its precisely because justice thomas has proven himself such a faithful steward of the constitution that barack obama says he wouldnt have nominated him
5471652 if he is elected obama is a sure bet to appoint liberal judicial activists eager to invent farfetched constitutional rights that entrench the lefts agenda on issues like same sex marriage stripping god out of the pledge of allegiance child pornography partial birth abortion and national security its obama who lacks the experience and judgment for the position that he seeks
5471653 obama started to say that justice thomas didnt have enough experience for the supreme court
5471654 even more troubling is what the illinois democrats answer betrays about his political habits of mind asked a question he didnt expect at a rare unscripted event the rookie candidate didnt merely say he disagreed with justice thomas instead he instinctively reverted to the leftwing clich that the courts black conservative isnt up to the job while his white conservative colleagues are
5471655 obama wants justices who will do his bidding who will implement the preferred policies of the liberal establishment not justices like thomas scalia roberts and alito who understand that the role of a judge is not to legislate from the bench
5471656 obamas answer about the three wisest people in his life upon whom he would rely heavily in his administration also sheds light on the way he would choose supreme court justices obama said he would consult his grandmother his wife and ted kennedy this is unlikely to yield the highest quality judicial nominees who understand the constitution and the role of judges in our constitutional democracy

5471685 michael phelps is a once in a lifetime once in a generation athlete
5471686 lignin is natures plastic and any organism that wants to get to the sugars in a plant has to be able to get past this protective barrier
5471687 we suspect that the fungus produces enzymes that help the beetles degrade lignin
5471688 how these insects are able to circumvent this plastic wall lignin and get at the goodies the sugars behind it has remained a mystery
5471689 we have been able to detect messages from the fungal dna which get translated into enzymes
5471690 the types of chemical changes we see in the beetle are similar to those seen in the white rot fungus
5471691 changes that we see in the termite are similar to those in the brown rot fungus the chemical changes to the lignin are similar
5471692 it is likely that there is an interaction among enzymes produced by the fungus hundreds of bacteria within the insect gut and the insect itself
5471693 this type of fungus in the asian longhorned beetle is known to cause disease in plants
5471694 but this particular strain appears to be unique it looks like these insects somehow acquired the fungus to live in their gut and help them break down wood
5471695 getting rid of the lignin barrier and making the cellulose more accessible is the most expensive and environmentally unfriendly part of making ethanol from biomass
5471696 i think that the winner in the presidential veepstakes is probably joe biden
5471697 if obama wants someone with experience theres no better pick than delaware senator joe biden
5471698 carl woese and his colleagues years ago established that protein translation had to be well developed when the evolution of modern cells started
5471699 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
5471700 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5471701 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5471702 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5471703 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5471704 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles
5471705 we introduce a way to relate wind stretch to dry air and dust which correlate very well with humidity in the western tropical atlantic

5471756 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5471757 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5471758 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5471759 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5471760 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5471761 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology

5471786 b ut also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment we felt an obligation to take these concerns very seriously we consulted with security experts as well as with scholars of islam whom we asked to review the book and offer their assessments of potential reactions we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house inc booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book

5471797 a ten year old can plot a comic its a reality maybe not a whole series arc ive received virtually plotless scripts i said it takes an adult to script a modern comic quit undermining 10 year olds theyre tomorrows todays writers

5471800 just playing around on this thread having some fun incorporating the disparate wacky stuff posted here throwing up ludicrous long winded tangential silliness
5471801 but dont pull that im just kidding shit if you said a comic could be layed out by a 10 year old not an entire arc and not the finished art youd have mirrored what i said about plot arc and script and it wouldnt have bothered me a bit i wouldnt have cut into you like that
5471802 having drawn over 150 stories i stand by what i said if an adult writer scripted a plot from a 10 year old it wouldnt win an eisner but itd pass unnoticed by a lot more people than many folks would like to believe

5471924 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15 percent

5471950 with combination therapy it is now possible to reach these low ldl goals they are not unrealistic
5471951 yet most patients outside specialty clinics are not reaching those goals in part because of poor compliance but also in part because practitioners are still hesitant to be more aggressive there continue to be concerns about safety and side effects despite the wealth of evidence that they are not serious problems in the vast majority of patients
5471952 would be reasonable to recommend that an ideal ldl cholesterol level should be defined as
5471953 the problem with that approach however is a practical one
5471954 we wont be around to see the benefits of those interventions begun in childhood it will take 30 or 40 or 50 years to establish the usefulness of those strategies even though such benefits seem reasonable and plausible while it is still a worthwhile goal what do we do with the millions of people who have disease and need something done now
5471955 i think we would end up using all of the resources in healthcare in a frantic way
5471956 i think we should try to identify ways in which to make society healthier but in medical terms i think we need better ways to identify high risk people they dont mention apob which is unfortunate because i dont think there is much doubt that apob identifies high risk people more precisely than ldl cholesterol thats not really debatable at this point why wouldnt we use better technology to identify fewer people to treat
5471957 so why wouldnt we want to do better target the patients better the real benefit comes from making sure you are treating the high risk patient and get them down to a low level
5471958 because of the effects of exposure if we can identify the high risk person earlier then we can make very substantial changes in outcome by intervening moderately earlier in life

5472026 bleeding complications are reduced by 70 percent when interventional cardiologists go in through a radial artery in the wrist
5472027 but our research shows that only a tiny fraction of stenting procedures are done this way the study suggests that maybe its time to change the way we practice
5472028 the findings are somewhat surprising given that numerous studies have shown that r pci is similarly successful to f pci and that r pci can significantly lower risk of bleeding especially among women patients younger than 75 and people undergoing pci for acute coronary syndrome
5472029 patients managed medically without stenting or bypass surgery tend to be elderly and frail and in some sense we feel they have been overlooked
5472030 we wanted to find out what clinical factors were funneling them into a medicine only group and what happened to them when compared to patients who received stents and bypass procedures
5472031 it is important to know that the patients in the medically managed group had a higher death rate despite receiving most of the currently recommended medications for this condition from clinical practice guidelines
5472032 there are often very good reasons why stenting or bypass are not viable options for some patients what this study tells us is that for these patients who are medically managed we need to come up with better treatment approaches that lessen their risk of death
5472033 there should be a post about the reasons that made make it difficult for us to leave faith a post about what hinders hindered us in walking away
5472034 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5472035 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5472036 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5472037 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5472038 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5472039 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology
5472040 there are many ways to kill a cell and weve discovered yet another one the bacterium hijacks activities from us and deregulates them its like a bulldozer
5472041 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
5472042 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high
5472043 the importance of primary sulfate is usually ignored in assessments of the impact of ship emissions on air quality because less than 7 percent of all sulfur emitted by ships is found in primary sulfate particles
5472044 but our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future knowing how much sulfate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 percent of sulfur emitted by ships
5472045 we found that in san diego the port of los angeles can be a significant influence on air quality because these fine particulates can travel so far
5472046 this will tell us whether californias new regulation requiring cleaner burning fuel 24 miles off the coast is having the effect its intended to have
5472047 and because a large part of the worlds population live in major cities with shipping ports such as new york city san francisco hong kong houston and singapore and global shipping is expected to increase in the decades to come this should help policy makers around the world make more informed decisions about improving the health of their citizens

5472052 on every issue important to fire fighters senator obama is and has been in our corner
5472053 the iaff is the most bipartisan union in the afl cio and we support those who support us we cant overlook senator mccains service to our country but we also cant overlook his poor record on issues critical to the financial security of our 290 000 members
5472054 wont become law unless we have a president whos willing to sign it and ill be that president it is unacceptable when fire fighters do not have collective bargaining rights but its not just collective bargaining for too long on too many issues fire fighters have not been treated with the dignity respect and honor you deserve
5472055 barack obama will be the best friend fire fighters have ever had in the white house
5472056 he comes from your ethic he understands the middle class is shrinking and that you are the middle class he understands that labor is the reason there is a middle class barack obama respects you you say what the hell everybody respects us wrong
5472057 dont tell me this administration respects you dont tell me barack obamas opponent respects you dont take away my collective bargaining rights and tell me you respect me dont tell me you respect me
5472058 weve fought and succeeded to keep you out of social security weve done it together in every instance barack obama has voted with us you guys have always been with me you stuck with me im here to tell you that barack obama will stick with you
5472059 once senator dodd stepped aside we needed to talk to our members gauge the candidates and examine their positions on the issues critical to fire fighters senator obama has shown fire fighters nothing but support in the illinois state senate and in the u s senate

5472065 this study shows that number abilities are not simply based on culture or language associate professor reeve says
5472066 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5472067 we need to investigate ways in which we can add on to these building blocks to develop ways of teaching numeracy that are relevant to indigenous students culture he says
5472068 we also need to redefine the way we think about numeracy across the board moving away from the view that we need words to describe numbers and basic computations
5472069 if you imagine a chessboard on which the dark squares are shrubs and the light squares are grasses warming alone would tend to increase the size of the dark squares until the chess board is completely filled in
5472070 our experiment suggests that herbivores like caribou and muskoxen will slow this process inhibit it or perhaps even increase the size of the white squares on the chessboard
5472071 this discovery is quite surprising considering that muskoxen occur at such a low density at our site
5472072 careful management and conservation of existing populations of muskoxen and caribou as well as other large herbivores should be a priority in plans to mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystems
5472073 until now these animals seem to have been regarded more as background noise than as an active component of the ecosystems response to warming
5472074 our results suggest that herbivores in the arctic and elsewhere may constrain the increase in shrub growth that is projected by current models of global warming their grazing could have important consequences for the ability of shrubs to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide insect outbreaks may become more frequent with future warming as well and our results also suggest an important role of such outbreaks in reducing shrubs
5472075 on the practical and policy sides of this story we need to be aware that the carbon dioxide sponge represented especially by shrubs and trees may not be as big as we thought it was this finding is yet another reason to think carefully about reducing carbon dioxide emissions
5472076 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5472077 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5472078 we all want to know whats going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
5472079 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5472080 thats the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system
5472081 it allows us to assess the response of one animal to a variety of conditions and gives us much more valuable information
5472082 a lot of research efforts are devoted to the basic science of stem cells
5472083 this work is focused on the immediate practicalities of actually using these cells therapeutically
5472084 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics

5472116 our findings clearly demonstrate that cheddar and low fat cheeses are suitable foods for vitamin d3
5472117 these findings will help to validate this approach for expanding the dietary sources of this essential nutrient for consumers this will ultimately increase vitamin d intakes in the population which are currently too low and could help bring about the public health benefits that result from a greater consumption of vitamin d
5472118 to our knowledge the fortification of reduced fat cheese with vitamin d3 has never been reported

5472148 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed

5472151 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis

5472173 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating to their board the significant strides made by take two since they last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007
5472174 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate and undervalued world class entertainment franchises and our strong operational and financial performance
5472175 this deal comes down to leverage and agreeing on a price at least for the moment ea doesnt have a lot of leverage over take two and take two doesnt like the price ea has offered
5472176 take two is flying high right now as a result of the success of grand theft auto that makes it tougher to make a deal happen without paying a premium that blows them away
5472177 everybody has a number the question is will ea pay the price in order to get take two without knowing what magic number is its hard to gauge is it a 20 percent premium is it a 50 percent premium

5472184 the court found that using reclaimed sewer water to make snow for skiing on an admittedly sacred site posed no substantial burden on the plaintiffs exercise of religion in this case
5472185 according to the court the only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience
5472186 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
5472187 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
5472188 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
5472189 was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra
5472190 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow

5472245 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5472246 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5472247 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5472248 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5472249 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5472250 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5472251 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5472252 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5472253 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5472254 in the future this new knowledge can be incorporated into developing new repellents and may be in control strategies for culex quinquefasciatus and other mosquitoes
5472255 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5472256 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5472257 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5472258 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5472259 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
5472260 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
5472261 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5472262 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem
5472263 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5472264 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5472265 ovarian cancer has a drug taxol that works pretty well in the beginning seventy or eighty percent of the patients have a response
5472266 but it fails at the end because drug resistance develops

5472277 the universal postal service canadians enjoy is only made possible by the post offices exclusive rights to letter service
5472278 canada is a vast diverse country and delivery costs for rural mail are many times higher than urban mail under deregulation for profit companies will focus on dense profitable areas leaving canada post with responsibility for delivery in costly rural areas while faced with declining revenues this is a recipe for drastic service cuts to public postal services and increased costs to canadians in rural and remote areas
5472279 allowing private companies into the letter market will also mean additional delivery vehicles decreasing the efficiency of letter delivery services while maximizing traffic and pollution

5472283 if we brought the buses as close as we could to people but those buses we knew were routinely going to experience unacceptable delays thats not very good service either
5472284 we hope that part of the reason that the number of recipients is going up is because weve worked to increase the rolls

5472287 we have identified a massive reservoir of pathogenic mtdna mutations in the general population placing greater emphasis on developing techniques to prevent the transmission of pathogenic alleles that could segregate to high levels and thus cause mtdna diseases in subsequent generations
5472288 detecting heteroplasmic mtdna mutations in gt 1 in 200 individuals of the background population has implications for studies reporting mtdna mutations in specific disease groups our data show that putative disease associations such as the reported high frequency of m 3243a g in diabetes mellitus could be a chance finding irrelevant to pathogenesis

5472295 shps is honored to partner with cummins for the 2008 harvard colloquium and to work collaboratively with cummins to improve the quality of care provided to our target population
5472296 based upon our findings the partnership anticipates increased awareness of the medication protocol and the benefit of medication compliance to both individuals as well as physicians
5472297 specifically we have found the means to improve cummins wellness programs with initiatives that lead individuals to healthier lifestyles and prevent the migration to higher more expensive ends of the healthcare spectrum

5472317 you can save money and save the environment by driving green
5472318 through ecodriving 10 top automakers and the states of california and colorado have found we share an important commitment and we commend governor schwarzenegger and governor ritter for their leadership in engaging consumers in green driving drivers dont have to wait to buy a new fuel efficient vehicle to start reducing fuel costs and co2 though i do encourage everyone to buy one of our new fuel efficient vehicles immediately
5472319 todays automobiles are really computers on wheels with more than 3 000 interactive parts operating as a complex system the more you know about your machine the better you can reduce fuel use and co2 emissions
5472320 consumers who are better aware of the operations of their vehicle will be rewarded by saving money at the gas pump and reducing co2 emissions working together we can substantially reduce co2 emissions and fuel use one ecodriver at a time
5472321 were all in this together so theres a role for each one of us to play in being a part of the solution to these critical issues
5472322 automakers are aggressively developing and introducing new technologies but it takes 15 years or more for these technologies to become widespread on the road ecodriving helps consumers reduce carbon dioxide emissions today

5472326 ohmigosh this is the first time ive admitted it but yes i do i dont use toys or anything just my fingers since its the summer it gets really hot at night so i like to sleep naked that leads to me touching myself at first i could only get one finger in cause imso tight but i kept working at it now when i get really wet from rubbing my clit i can fit two fingers in i wonder how it will feel with a guys thingie in there

5472332 the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5472333 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain

5472380 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5472381 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5472382 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5472383 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5472384 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5472385 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology
5472386 there are many ways to kill a cell and weve discovered yet another one the bacterium hijacks activities from us and deregulates them its like a bulldozer
5472387 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5472388 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5472389 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5472390 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5472391 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5472392 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound

5472396 in the future this new knowledge can be incorporated into developing new repellents and may be in control strategies for culex quinquefasciatus and other mosquitoes
5472397 presents as a very logical basis to help us understand how deet is perceived by the mosquitoes and this work provides an excellent explanation to link physiological processing within the mosquito to the macroscopic behavioral response that we observe in laboratory bioassays with this repellent
5472398 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5472399 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5472400 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5472401 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5472402 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5472403 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5472404 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5472405 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles
5472406 its almost like everyone is doing well weve got a lot of people coming back so thats a good thing
5472407 weve been going on our eighth day and been in the gym almost six hours a day theyve been competing and really working hard through all of it

5472410 we will still continue to work on our hitting percentage last year our hitting percentage was about sixth in the league we need to put balls in bounce and make less hitting errors with the game going to 25 its even more important to not lose points on errors
5472411 realistically we should be fifth or sixth in the conference with everybody returning challenging goal would be fourth or third and then barrier breaking would be one or two in the league
5472412 last year was exciting we were in the hunt we were playing against the top of the league and we were actually there if you set a goal we want to win the league sometimes that anxiousness can lead to poor performance

5472455 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan

5472457 this is the first study to comprehensively look at a large population of infected persons to study the long term effects of west nile virus
5472458 we found that both physical and mental functions as well as mood and fatigue seemed to return to normal in about one year
5472459 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5472460 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5472461 we all want to know whats going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
5472462 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5472463 thats the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system
5472464 it allows us to assess the response of one animal to a variety of conditions and gives us much more valuable information
5472465 a lot of research efforts are devoted to the basic science of stem cells
5472466 this work is focused on the immediate practicalities of actually using these cells therapeutically

5472512 substituting chicken fish or vegetables for red meat can help over the past two years ive given up eating beef save for that one or two double doubles from in n out
5472513 in fact putting these foods on the dinner table does more to reduce carbon emissions than eating locally grown food researchers report
5472514 we suggest that dietary shift can be a more effective means of lowering an average households food related climate footprint than buying local
5472515 shifting less than one day per weeks worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken fish eggs or a vegetable based diet achieves more greenhouse gas reduction than buying all locally sourced food

5472529 we already offer two really well diversified international etfs so i dont think we have any plans to offer this as an etf

5472531 anything that vanguard launches thats broad based would attract assets
5472532 were trying to reflect those underlying assets rather than fund ownership
5472533 the foreign tax credit is one of them we can better track the index and we have more flexibility in how we manage taxes in the portfolio
5472534 its an opportunity to make some transactions in a tax free way
5472535 we want to make sure we do this in a way that has the lowest impact to shareholders its a combination of markets and cash flows in and out of the funds that will allow us to get to that point

5472553 i would think that at some level this is standard practice
5472554 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5472555 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5472556 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5472557 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5472558 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5472559 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5472560 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5472561 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5472562 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5472563 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5472564 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5472565 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5472566 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5472567 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5472568 the objectives were to provide product trial among a key physician group to accelerate uptake of vioxx as the second entrant in a highly competitive new class

5472632 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5472641 it will help the credibility of canada when the canadian boxers are better known to international judges and its going to get us better results
5472642 we now have taken a significant step in a project which will lift the standards across all areas of boxing
5472643 in the last couple of years canadian boxing has been a disaster
5472644 scotland has become famous for its call centres but this is the wrong end of the value chain to concentrate on

5472679 due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from outside the device the data messaging facility of the gtalkservice will not be present in android 1 0

5472717 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period

5472720 by the end of the day if the weather cooperates we can probably get all of our tourists out of there
5472721 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5472722 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5472723 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side

5472735 the action and inaction on this issue tells you what the priorities are
5472736 right now the priorities are spending cuts we need to prioritize the tax breaks against what spending were looking to cut
5472737 we dont want to take away any tax cuts if we can avoid it particularly when you are trying to incentivize businesses and create jobs
5472738 the 50 million tax break for vouchers needs to be on the table to cut the insurance tax breaks need to be on the table
5472739 there arent many ways we can stimulate the economy but thats probably the best weapon we have

5472750 high energy prices across the economy rising air fares and airline schedule cuts are the primary drivers of the overall reduction in passenger volumes expected for this labor day period
5472751 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and business travelers are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all

5472779 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5472780 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5472781 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5472782 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5472783 this cannot be done using but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5472784 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words

5472795 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5472796 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5472797 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5472798 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5472799 signs of not getting enough sleep or sleeping poorly include consistently taking more than 30 minutes to fall asleep awakening more than a few times or for long periods each night feeling sleepy during the day or having trouble concentrating at school or at work

5472864 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all
5472865 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5472866 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5472867 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5472868 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defenses protecting the brain from infection
5472869 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5472870 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5472871 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5472872 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
5472873 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5472874 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream
5472875 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb
5472876 they have been separated for almost a year but remain close friends
5472877 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5472878 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5472879 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5472880 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5472881 lignin is natures plastic and any organism that wants to get to the sugars in a plant has to be able to get past this protective barrier
5472882 we suspect that the fungus produces enzymes that help the beetles degrade lignin
5472883 how these insects are able to circumvent this plastic wall lignin and get at the goodies the sugars behind it has remained a mystery
5472884 we have been able to detect messages from the fungal dna which get translated into enzymes
5472885 the types of chemical changes we see in the beetle are similar to those seen in the white rot fungus
5472886 changes that we see in the termite are similar to those in the brown rot fungus the chemical changes to the lignin are similar
5472887 it is likely that there is an interaction among enzymes produced by the fungus hundreds of bacteria within the insect gut and the insect itself
5472888 this type of fungus in the asian longhorned beetle is known to cause disease in plants
5472889 but this particular strain appears to be unique it looks like these insects somehow acquired the fungus to live in their gut and help them break down wood
5472890 getting rid of the lignin barrier and making the cellulose more accessible is the most expensive and environmentally unfriendly part of making ethanol from biomass
5472891 carl woese and his colleagues years ago established that protein translation had to be well developed when the evolution of modern cells started
5472892 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
5472893 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5472894 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5472895 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5472896 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5472897 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles

5472899 the holy grail of enzyme catalysis and the ultimate manifestation of understanding of this process is the ability to design enzymes
5472900 what really fits is the electrostatic interaction between the enzyme active site to the substrate charges at the so called transition state where the bonds are halfway to being broken
5472901 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5472902 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5472903 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5472904 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5472905 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5472906 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5472907 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5472908 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5472909 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5472910 in the future this new knowledge can be incorporated into developing new repellents and may be in control strategies for culex quinquefasciatus and other mosquitoes
5472911 presents as a very logical basis to help us understand how deet is perceived by the mosquitoes and this work provides an excellent explanation to link physiological processing within the mosquito to the macroscopic behavioral response that we observe in laboratory bioassays with this repellent
5472912 opening the door of the political process to people who have never taken part in the past has been the bedrock of our planning for this convention since we arrived in denver one year ago
5472913 twelve months and 56 primaries and caucuses later its only fitting that our delegates represent that same core value and barack obamas unparalleled ability to bring more new people in to the electoral process than ever before young and old first timers and convention veterans all representing a broad spectrum of backgrounds and communities this is a delegation that will bring americas voices to denver
5472914 in just days delegates will come together in denver to conduct the most important business of the convention nominating barack obama as our partys nominee for the next president of the united states
5472915 as we gather in denver to change the course of our nation we will truly represent the strength and diversity of our party and our country
5472916 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
5472917 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high
5472918 the importance of primary sulfate is usually ignored in assessments of the impact of ship emissions on air quality because less than 7 percent of all sulfur emitted by ships is found in primary sulfate particles
5472919 but our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future knowing how much sulfate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 percent of sulfur emitted by ships
5472920 we found that in san diego the port of los angeles can be a significant influence on air quality because these fine particulates can travel so far
5472921 this will tell us whether californias new regulation requiring cleaner burning fuel 24 miles off the coast is having the effect its intended to have
5472922 and because a large part of the worlds population live in major cities with shipping ports such as new york city san francisco hong kong houston and singapore and global shipping is expected to increase in the decades to come this should help policy makers around the world make more informed decisions about improving the health of their citizens
5472923 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5472924 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5472925 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5472926 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5472927 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
5472928 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
5472929 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5472930 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem

5473001 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5473002 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5473003 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5473004 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5473005 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5473008 this type of political punishment proves that democrats will not tolerate independent thought
5473009 how many other lawmakers are being bullied and intimidated by democrat leadership for refusing to join them in their out of control spending

5473018 this is yet another sad day for california and its citizens freedom
5473019 it seems that every few weeks we witness another constitutional freedom or right being taken away from us by activist judges bent on forcing homosexuality upon us
5473020 some citizens have bought into the dangerous lie that homosexual marriage will have no impact on our religious freedom
5473021 the california supreme courts decision proves that these activist judges are willing to deny our first amendment religious freedom in order to create rights for homosexuals if homosexual marriage remains legal the courts will soon start mandating homosexual marriage ceremonies in all churches

5473031 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man

5473077 it can be argued that canadian human rights tribunals are insensitive to the practicalities of operating a business and accommodating members of a workforce who may or may not have realistic expectations of how their unique situations might be handled

5473093 previously batch scanning has had a significantly higher cagr than other segments of the document capture software market that we track we are now seeing the transaction capture segment having the highest cagr going forward although we have some concerns regarding the world economy that may negatively affect growth from a base of us 670 million in 2007 we expect that transaction capture will have a cagr of 16 5 to 2011
5473094 capture is no longer just truncating the paper into an image so you can find it nowadays corporate users want the software to understand and extract relevant data automatically from it
5473095 this is driving a move towards the transactional segment of the market
5473096 we are also seeing a move towards truncating paper to a usable image at the point of entry to the organization
5473097 for example over 50 of users reported using a digital copier as a scanner in a recent survey we did with the tawpi organization www tawpi org capture of business documents in the mailroom is increasing in the future we will use the camera on a cell phone to capture documents
5473098 these trends toward distributed and transactional capture represent an understanding by users that traditional forms of information capture are expensive and that major savings can be achieved through automating and integrating capture into the work process so that document based information can be acted on at the earliest opportunity
5473099 even in the batch segment there are some emerging global opportunities for large scale back file conversions as well as a new movement towards national mail services delivering scanned images in place of paper mail additionally developing countries are only just starting to use capture technology as increasing labor costs prompt re evaluations of how best to get the work done still the adhoc and batch segments market grew less quickly which we believe will continue as these segments become more mature

5473103 the basic value proposition of this highly innovative company is that it strengthens the physician patient relationship by stimulating patients in need of care to take action to interact with their physicians nothing is fundamentally more important to the effort to improve healthcare outcomes than the relationship between patients and their physicians the potential to build additional decision support tools and physician driven technology enabled disease management services on top of phytels existing outreach services platform is very exciting and perfectly leverages my past industry experience

5473130 in fact there is only one ocean on earth a world ocean encompassing 70 78 percent of our planet the ancient greeks sensed the ocean was one and portrayed their water god okeanos oceanus as a river circling the world three thousand years later modern oceanographers confirm the world ocean is connected in riverlike fashion using a schematic known as the ocean conveyor belt they portray okeanos as a m biuslike ribbon winding through all the ocean basins rising and falling and stirring the waters of the world in this manner the surface waters we sail in the north atlantic are destined to flow to the arctic to grow colder and sink and once at the bottom to reverse flow southward through the atlantic eventually converging with the antarctic circumpolar current before surfacing in the northeast pacific 1 200 years from now centuries later they will arrive back in the north atlantic having truly traveled the seven seas or maybe they wont things are changing

5473137 are you sure you know how the modified controls work
5473138 okay this first level is based off the information database of the tardis its one of the easier but larger systems to decode
5473139 over the centuries ive collected data on hundreds of species thousands of planets and millions of places throughout time and space
5473140 as you go through the first level there will be pieces of a puzzle you have to collect in order to decrypt the firewall at the end
5473141 manifestations of the different safety codes will appear as doors
5473142 and as avatars the stronger the avatar the closer you are to the end
5473143 none of those items are of this time like the pendant we used with some of you most arent even of this planet
5473144 time isnt linear its circular the past present and future all exist all at once
5473145 not a crisis of epic proportions im afraid im supposed to be meeting a friend for dinner and im late
5473146 ms smith your companion has already arrived if you will follow me
5473147 why dont you come along and meet him we have a mutual friend in common
5473148 i heard a rumour that your current assignment had finished
5473149 you look well sarah but how would you know anything about my current assignment
5473150 oh harry have you met jack harkness jack this is harry sullivan
5473151 it was good seeing you both again but my party has arrived so i must take my leave
5473152 i worked with torchwood on a project back in the 80s before we lost the funding and how do you know him
5473153 its not what you think hes another former companion of the doctor who i met during the dalek invasion the doctor says hello by the way and im very sorry about your brother
5473154 how would you know what i think and when have you ever cared about my opinion
5473155 i dont think i ever got used to him flirting with everything that moves
5473156 will left me a note explaining everything i think he regretted his involvement with the orb with what he got involved in
5473157 so what have you been up to lately i heard a rumour that you adopted a son
5473158 my client was not under arrest he had not participated in any criminal acts and according to the allegheny county district attorneys office he was not about to be arrested for any reason
5473159 therefore the question remains how can a man die in the custody of the police when he is not the suspect of any criminal activity
5473160 it is our intention to show at trial that mr nugent caused the death of baron pikes by tasing him multiple times unnecessarily and in violation of louisiana law and by failing to get him medical attention when it was apparent he needed it
5473161 in a civilized society abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated
5473162 whereas recently in philadelphia and other cities officials have condemned and even charged police officers caught using excessive force against civilians here in pittsburgh high ranking officials all immediately made excuses for the police they should at least wait for all the facts
5473163 swissvale should put a moratorium on use of tasers until theres a policy
5473164 attacked struck kicked punched bludgeoned beat repeatedly shocked him with a taser
5473165 we expect our officers to use some degree of judgment and discretion on the street
5473166 police thought he was dangerous how dangerous to whom in order to know if its ok to have used an electroshock weapon on a person you have to know what kind of danger this person posed you use the amount of force to meet the danger presented
5473167 if the guy is using fists youre one step ahead you use pepper spray but its messy it can get in your eyes you could use your night stick or metal baton but thats going to open some wounds up if the persons bigger than you and you shoot them you could kill them if you use the taser it will put them down in a heartbeat
5473168 police use it as a weapon of first choice thats the pattern weve noticed
5473169 yeah right it will take a serious silver bullet to kill the money sucking nightmare that is windows
5473170 only the biggest apple fans or microsoft haters believe you have to eliminate microsoft to defeat them
5473171 hi abstractizman i am delighted to let you know that your submitted photo has been selected for inclusion in the newly released fifth edition of our schmap cologne guide thanks so much for letting us include your photo please enjoy the guide best regards e w managing editor schmap guides
5473172 this is a free web based program schools can use to ensure a safer environment
5473173 all schools are concerned about security and this helps school districts provide a safer environment by monitoring and controlling the attendees at the event
5473174 once i get through the security checkpoints at the airport i feel pretty darn safe with the changes in society safety at schools is becoming the number one priority
5473175 some of the larger urban schools have tried selling advance tickets but there was no name on the ticket as a way of preventing violence and that hasnt worked effectively
5473176 matching the pre sold ticket with an i d is just like what happens at airport security
5473177 it will hurt sales because you wouldnt have a crowd anywhere near if you would have sold tickets at the gate
5473178 this is a service that goes along the lines of ticketmaster but it has the ability to limit who can purchase the tickets and its not an online service that charges exorbitant fees
5473179 schools that decide to use this service for contests will have to do a very good job of educating their public about purchasing tickets in advance
5473180 however as the program advances it will get more sophisticated where tickets could be sold at the gate
5473181 the unanimous response was provide me with a safe and secure environment the same feeling must persist for our after school events as well
5473182 looksmart has a strong online marketing brand and a long operating history
5473183 while we did not want to change our trade name our new corporate identity reflects our commitment to quality search advertising products and services through the companys proven adcenter platform and tenacious delivery of results for search advertisers and web publishers on our search advertising networks
5473184 looksmarts business transition from a consumer web directory and search engine to a trusted independent search advertising network and technology solutions provider was not yet fully addressed
5473185 looksmart has gone through a compelling evolution and needed a look that captures its leadership position today
5473186 it is great to see looksmarts brand identity reflect the great work the companys employees have been doing in growing our business in search advertising networks
5473187 we have emerged as an essential complement to web publishers and search advertisers who seek to go beyond the major search engines to monetize their traffic and extend their advertising reach cost effectively

5473195 hollywood didnt send its stars to us we sent our stars to them
5473196 isaac came from our culture he emanated our culture thats why he never lost his authenticity never lost his conviction
5473197 there would be no isaac hayes without stax and no stax without isaac hayes
5473198 hip hop wouldnt be what it is without isaac hayes
5473199 i am going to get dressed and then i am going set the coordinates to random and we are going to explore whatever is outside those doors like mature sensible adults instead of the primitive uncivilised animals you two seem to have devolved into
5473200 were on a cruise ship the lower levels by the looks of it which would explain why theres no one about
5473201 well thats bloody typical of you take us halfway across the universe just to see the disused decks of a cruise ship all my dreams have been fulfilled
5473202 be careful there jack dont want to press something youre not supposed to
5473203 yeah freak no blowing us up i do not want to die on some crappy cruise ship just because you like pressing buttons
5473204 what the hell have you done you useless bloody ape
5473205 you were the idiot who was playing with things he didnt understand and now look what youve done
5473206 but believe it or not killing you isnt its only function it also comes with a variety of torture settings which im sure youll remember
5473207 can age or de age a body and do everything the sonic screwdriver can do
5473208 including scanning for residual energy left behind by the transmat
5473209 he could be floating around in a vacuum right now
5473210 unable to breathe his lifeless body floating endlessly around in the dark recesses of space
5473211 and itll be all your fault on your conscience for the rest of your life you killed the doctor hes dead because of you you killed the doctor
5473212 or he could have landed in the middle of a battle field or on a dalek warship or in the middle of a great big furnace
5473213 hes probably dying a horrible and painful death right now
5473214 well theres this immortal one jack hes called really good looking muscled blue eyes gorgeous smile you know the type
5473215 and yknow hes been madly in love with me for over a hundred years he says hes been following me for a long time but dont get the wrong idea he isnt a stalker at least i dont think he is mind you he did have my hand all that time id hate to think what hes been doing to it
5473216 and then theres the master only one of my species left known him since i was a kid which is a long time to know someone when youre over nine hundred years old dont you think
5473217 anyway hes a raving lunatic who likes to take over the universe for kicks and has this weird obsession with me that hes had since we were kids
5473218 but now im living with both of them trying to have a happy three way relationship but the only problem is they hate each others guts which i suppose you could say is understandable since the master spent a whole year torturing jack but youd think since they share a common interest theyd put their differences aside wouldnt you
5473219 and now they spend so much time arguing and fighting that they forget about me and neither of them realise that if they both learn to share they can both get what they want which incidentally is what i want and then everybody would be happy
5473220 so im hoping that while im gone the two of them will be so distraught and concerned for my safety that they make friends and join forces in trying to find me doing their alpha male thing where they rescue the poor damsel in distress blah blah i wish theyd realise that im really the one pulling the strings they do underestimate me you know
5473221 more importantly what do you mean are we getting along yet
5473222 um question one a party a party with lots of music and lots of drinks and lots of bored rich gits question two i mean are you two getting along yet now that youve had time to get to know each other
5473223 what a strange thing to be top of your priorities after being unexpectedly transmatted across the universe
5473224 actually i think i was only transmatted upstairs onto the main deck
5473225 then how come we could find no record of where you went
5473226 i may have rigged it so you couldnt find me
5473227 i wanted you to worry so youd put aside your differences and try to find me together

5473336 record losses from the subprime fallout and rising delinquencies have squeezed issuers credit so tight theyre tapping out add that to the fact that consumers credit is already stretched and youre left with a tough market for credit card issuers
5473337 cutbacks in direct marketing are part of financials institutions plan to ride this through we see notably less credit card and mortgage offers as companies figure out key messaging services and products for todays anxious weary consumer

5473344 clearly the legal framework against the use of forced child labor exists in uzbekistan
5473345 despite this fact there are continued reports of the systemic and persistent use of forced child labor in the cotton fields of uzbekistan

5473641 put the rights of all cohabitants on a level playing field
5473642 a federal judge has denied a warner bros motion to dismiss 20th century foxs legal battle over the rights to develop produce and distribute a film based on the graphic novel watchmen
5473643 in essence the judge appears to conclude that fox retained distribution rights in watchmen through the 1991 largo quit claim and he concludes that under the 1994 turnaround producer larry gordon acquired an option to acquire foxs remaining interest in watchmen that was never exercised thereby leaving fox with its rights under the 1994 agreement
5473644 while the judges opinion is preliminary and his views could change in the course of the litigation his current take on the facts is consistent with our position
5473645 the coaching staff talked about it for a long time last night we looked at every statistic that we kept from pass completions yards per catch yards after catch interceptions percentage of drives scoring good practices and bad practices we even consulted with some of the players really when you look at all the data jordan steffy has earned the spot he was ahead in almost every category
5473646 we rotated the quarterbacks with all the teams for the last nine practices so everybody had an equal shot with every team
5473647 i think theres a credibility thing here if you dont reward kids for practicing well then i dont know what you can base your decision on what made it hard is that chris played well in the games and i think thats his m o but based on not only fall practice but i even went back to spring practices steffy was far and away ahead in all the statistics
5473648 i think theyll all end up playing throughout the year to be honest with you
5473649 the biggest thing for me is how well jordan has played
5473650 i think people need to get behind him and support him hes worked his butt off theres no question he knows where everybody is and what were doing hes just got to go out and do it he is ahead in that light
5473651 i dont think theres another team in the acc that has three quarterbacks like we do
5473652 now thats great the most important thing is the one quarterback you have on the field but i dont know if theres anybody who has three like we do

5473654 can you build me a wall 10ft high and curved through 90 degrees

5473656 if we make if 9ft high and curve through 85 degrees then surely it wont cost any more than a 10ft straight wall will it
5473657 well it would save me about 10 of the time due to the height but its still more work than a straight wall
5473658 erm ok then just make it 8ft tall and curved through 80 degrees but do it in the same time and cost as a straight wall

5473666 drugs that improve health are not only going to be used by people who have medical problems they may also be used by people who are healthy or by athletes who want an edge

5473669 the world must not be divided so dont be like those who divide things
5473670 i must be going to the bus stop now because it looks like rain and i forgot to bring an umbrella
5473671 ive got to run to catch the bus itll be raining cats and dogs and i dont want to be caught with my pants down
5473672 this is our world as it exists today it was not always this way
5473673 what you see before you is evidence that our troubled past has long been healed very few of our kind still inhabit this world in physical bodies a select few do so because they volunteer to be physical caretakers of our planet the rest have evolved to a nonphysical existence this is the happy ending to a very long story let me go back a few millennia and start there
5473674 like humans we were a warlike species that fought over limited resources
5473675 in our desire to defeat our perceived enemies we looked for anything that might give us an advantage
5473676 we dug deep within the ground to tap the molten center of our planet and to draw from it the heat we needed to power our society
5473677 war kept our planetary population in check but it also brought about an increasing dependence upon the planet for additional energy to fuel our weapons of destruction
5473678 our unchecked mining and burrowing ushered in a period of great volcanism on the planet
5473679 soon more people were being killed from the explosions than from our wars
5473680 as the heat trapped within the core of our planet poured into our atmosphere it caused a rapid change in our environment
5473681 but another problem developed that we could not ignore as our climate changed it became difficult to breathe all the venting of energy was literally changing the gaseous combination of our atmosphere we eventually realized we would soon asphyxiate if we didnt do something
5473682 this invisible threat was sufficiently frightening that we united in an effort to resolve it
5473683 at first we tried to seal the energy vents but that quickly proved futile since anything covering the vents soon melted away
5473684 as this was a planet wide problem it was not solved overnight
5473685 in time the benefits of cooperation grew so obvious that they became the preferred way of living after three generations of this the plans that our grandparents made for returning to our previous warlike existence seemed more like the subject for our history books than a prescription for our future within a few more generations our previous warlike existence was considered to be our legendary strength but not our current way of being
5473686 i can certainly see parallels with our own planet but it gives me hope for the future
5473687 this history ive recounted glosses over many difficulties we encountered on the way to resolving our problems
5473688 but it points out that it took a common crisis to bring our people together this is a fairly frequent theme in the development of intelligent species but the outcome of the crisis depends upon the collective wisdom and capabilities of the individuals the societies involved and the species as a whole
5473689 cooperation and self organizing systems are a natural development as intelligence and complexity increase
5473690 but that transition need not follow a prescriptive path free will always dominates our species was lucky or rather we were lucky that we chose the path of prudence and diligence when we did we chose to do what was necessary to survive even though it went against our natural way of being your species has yet to negotiate the transition that is why so many of us have gathered to observe and render assistance to humanity at this time
5473691 im building a bridge to the imaginal world to help others connect there
5473692 its as real as the physical world and you can learn to visit it once you learn to discriminate between worlds you can step back and forth at will if you do this successfully your life is greatly enriched
5473693 the imagination is not something which should be considered only an artifact of brain metabolism or what is considered to be your personal mind
5473694 the creative imagination is inevitably a collaboration between the physical and the non physical whether the person is aware of this process or not all of the best creative endeavors are collaborations between the physical and non physical worlds
5473695 we have a cultural bias toward physical reality taught by the amnesiacs who live here
5473696 since they dont remember their connection to the imaginal realm they say youre only awake when your awareness is here in the phenomenal world rather than there in the imaginal
5473697 in the past people considered the imaginal realms to be separate domains that people visited in the privacy of their own thoughts or sleep
5473698 now theyre gradually coming to see them as real places with recognizable landmarks different types of citizens and creatures and even rules or laws that are comparable if not similar to those of the phenomenal world of physical reality
5473699 of those that do most flit from idea to idea or place like place like shoppers dropping into a super wal mart they look at an item here and there but they dont visit any one place long enough to get to know it
5473700 those who repeatedly visit a particular area establish a strong connection that makes it not only easier for them to return but for others as well
5473701 you sent your intention ahead of you theres no need to wait you can go on back
5473702 well im not sure what can you tell me about it
5473703 well how many strands are there and why would i want more to be activated how does it all work
5473704 how it all works in physical reality i really cant say im just a healer here not an expert go between at comparing worlds
5473705 how about if i tell you how it works at this level and then you make the connections with how things work in your physical body
5473706 the idea is to change the nature of your internal wiring in order to reduce your resistance to source energy bigger better conductive and more plentiful wires mean you can run increasingly stronger spiritual energy through your system
5473707 dna represents the filaments through which source energy animates your body want to see how yours looks
5473708 i know you know how to run source energy through your system but i want you let the energy bath do it for you
5473709 its cleaning out your system and its showing me which areas in your body need some tuning up would you like a tune up
5473710 humans are always connected to source energy but your thoughts and emotions can limit your capacity to carry that energy they impede its flow through the body
5473711 by increasing the carrying capacity of your dna were going to increase your ability to experience source energy this will also enhance your basic five senses in physical and nonphysical reality and it will probably increase your intuition and other psychic abilities as well
5473712 im seeing some scaring around your heart chakra from a recent event
5473713 this is helping to eliminate the limiting thoughts that caused this ailment
5473714 but like the pyro tape its only elevating your vibration to be permanent youll need to change your thinking patterns no one can do that but you
5473715 keep this with you it contains a record of all that happened here today and much more besides
5473716 when you want to access this information just imagine yourself holding the crystal it will all be available to you
5473717 and if you want to come again well arrange a visit upstairs for an even higher level of tuning
5473718 i was walking down a stairway and looking out the window on a summer day when suddenly i experienced myself sitting around a campfire on a cold black night chanting the name of indra an ancient hindu god of fire
5473719 what was strange about it was the reading wasnt like learning new material but a remembering for me it was a wake up call
5473720 i started getting some serious messages that it was time for me to start teaching i told my guides i had a job and didnt have time suddenly my job disappeared and i had lots of time now these new opportunities are opening up for me
5473721 theres a lot of things we can do in the near term and a lot of things we can do in the further term theres a lot more to go in terms of efficiency improvements
5473722 it would be really stupid to make a sequential decision around a hybrid in a commodore before we have efficiency in the base architecture done im talking about all the pieces to get an efficient platform
5473723 we want to give whats important to the customers which is the operating efficiency of a small car in a large car

5473778 the lord is near to all who call on him to all who call on him in truth
5473779 i traveled to pakistan when i was in college i knew what sunni and shia was sic before i joined the senate foreign relations committee
5473780 business trip because he is observing architecture and public facilities and attending local council meetings
5473781 from december 2004 to august 2005 the city made six disbursements totaling 116 458 to lp enterprises
5473782 i can say unequivocally that i have never intentionally done anything wrong nor have i done anything that i did not believe was in the best interest of the city of mandeville
5473783 mr goyeneches call for my resignation is ill advised i have done nothing to warrant my resignation and do not believe that would be in the best interest of the city at this time
5473784 the citys not going to come back until we have housing for the people who can work in the recovery police officers nurses those sorts of essential professionals
5473785 if someone tells you they can repair your credit and all you have to do is hand them 400 thats just a big lie what we can do is work on your credit score and i show them how to do that
5473786 i was fresh outta being stupid working on it after growing up a bit but i never had a new car
5473787 i always drove a raggedy car until i could afford my own house
5473788 we wanted to thank them and others we never got a chance to thank
5473789 this memorial is really a chance for us to publicly reach out to all those people who came here physically or sent a loved one or sent a gift or funds we want this to be a tribute to them and the hundreds of thousands of animals that perished
5473790 we would like to adopt out more animals so we can come back to the city this time wed like to create an animal cruelty investigation bureau thats our dream because were actually a licensed private detective agency and our main focus is responding to animal cruelty investigations so wed like to return to our original mission
5473791 any skills you have we can put them to work
5473792 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5473793 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
5473794 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
5473795 i was expecting to be on a host committee to honor katrina survivors
5473796 i love mr bernardo and when he asked me to be on a committee to honor katrina survivors there was no mention of the mayor and no mention of me being co chair
5473797 i dont think we ought to be honoring the mayor
5473798 i think if were honoring anybody it ought to start with the survivors of the storm and then the first responders then the neighborhood and faith based leaders not the government not the government
5473799 life isnt about the amount of breaths you take its about the moments that take your breath away
5473800 our associations want the best and safest pumps to be used in the planned new pumping stations and want to be certain all alternatives are considered
5473801 with the loss of other senior members of our louisiana delegation this year now more than ever we need sen landrieus experience and seniority
5473802 this is good news for the state good news for the city and good news for the country
5473803 this is a portion of the plan that will create a safer and higher bridge out of harms way
5473804 my goal will be to work closely with the staff as well as members of the board of regents to effectively communicate all of our higher education programs and policies and i welcome that opportunity
5473805 don gurewitz joetta maue patricia zalisko and new orleanian barbie lhoste whose collage painting
5473806 make up becas current exhibition four an unusual expression of participatory democracy it is all part of becas broader mission as a bridge for emerging contemporary artists
5473807 its like youre walking into a friends home and i think the charm of that is what makes us so different
5473808 if we dont know them we get to know them we develop a bond and a friendship with them its truly about the guests and the experiences
5473809 at this point were not fighting to get these programs back
5473810 our clients have been transitioned our staff is gone what we want is the system the process corrected
5473811 the mayor didnt sign those award letters until june 23
5473812 the selection only prompts a negotiation and does not guarantee a city contract
5473813 you should begin no work until all parties execute the contract
5473814 would you have time to review say 67 proposals that are 250 300 pages in length its hard to get people to do that kind of review
5473815 what it does and its not just that grant but its hopwa housing opportunities for people with aids too which started in january it makes all organizations survive off a credit line
5473816 they pay interest on the credit and have to fundraise to pay the interest because the interest cant be paid by a federal grant
5473817 so from january to november we had to survive on a credit line and thats a lot of money
5473818 i needed someone to take me by the hand because i didnt know what i was doing
5473819 i could still call him because he gave me his personal phone number and he told me to call him if i ever needed help
5473820 i am this i am these clients and thats why we provide these services
5473821 theyre all struggling to establish lines of communication with these primary medical entities
5473822 we didnt get enough money and it didnt come soon enough
5473823 i have depleted my line of credit and all small fundraising projects
5473824 anybody would have a hard time but realistically within six months we usually have the contracts executed which is fairly quick considering other city contracts
5473825 the local award process must be done within a reasonable amount of time the expectation is 120 days however we have no control over delays at the local level
5473826 thats a tragic situation because it puts everyone in a bind
5473827 if we didnt we couldnt offer primary care case management delivered meals mental health etc
5473828 we would have to stop on february 28 normally the last day in the fiscal year we do take a chance every year even with the award letter
5473829 i cant tell an agency how to handle their finances
5473830 but we have 12 other agencies that are in operation and if hickerson cant sustain the needs of his clients they can go elsewhere
5473831 people need to feel confident that the people who serve them will understand not just hiv aids but the many complicated obstacles in their life from poverty education housing jobs etc and how this disease impacts all of those issues and others
5473832 these are the poorest people of the poor the city literally drove michael out of business he was working with people no aids didnt know how to work with

5473865 reuters pakistans beleaguered president pervez musharraf resigned on monday in the face of an impending impeachment motion by the nuclear armed nations ruling coalition government
5473866 it russia can then play that energy card to block further nato expansion to its borders to prevent criticism of its anti democratic government and to win support for the foreign ambitions of its state owned companies
5473867 while it is early days to say what the security situation is going to look like in georgia longer term the events of the past few days deal a blow to the u s s plans to support existing and new oil and gas routes that bypass russia
5473868 what happened in georgia has come on the back of other events in russia that have increased market concerns
5473869 together these are increasing the risk perception around the russian market
5473870 take all the money you want to lose to russia and you wont be disappointed
5473871 i dont think direct investors will be so easily deterred and they will still be seeking opportunities across all different sectors of the russian economy including energy
5473872 intended to reorganize the russian oil and gas industry to enhance the power of the russian state
5473873 only then after the reorganization was complete and the states capacity to protect the national interests in this strategic sector was reaffirmed would western firms be invited to participate in the russian market
5473874 russia knows they are providing huge amounts to natural gas to europe that they have a stranglehold on europe
5473875 there is no question in my mind that russia is going to play its energy card as much as it can
5473876 russias energy objective is to monopolize all caspian energy flows to europe so that it can then blackmail europe and force political changes to european policy
5473877 what is really at stake is the unrestricted access of caspian oil to world markets
5473878 if as a byproduct of the conflict in georgia people become more wary in the future of expanding the capacity of the export corridor through georgia then there will be no tears shed in moscow

5473880 when we thought about how best to pay tribute our dear friend and colleague laura genender we decided that we should write as much or as little as we felt that we needed to to tell everyone a little bit about a woman that we here at mmorpg com were proud to call a colleague and a friend when youve finished reading we would like to encourage you to spend some time in the forums either reading some of the many posts that have already been made about laura or posting something of your own we know that she had interactions with many of you and would love to hear any thoughts or stories that you may have
5473881 we started this process in december at 26 per share and its management then rejected it that assumption was predicated on the idea that we would be able to sell its games at christmas 2008
5473882 my interpretation is that ea management still wants this business but that the offer is going to be at or below the previous price
5473883 the biggest product take two has to offer has now launched and ea is not going to be able to take advantage of those revenues
5473884 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating to its board the significant strides made by take two since it last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007
5473885 take two passed on the best offer on the planet
5473886 we had been hit with the downturn in residential development in las vegas so we decided it made more sense to sell some of our equipment with ritchie bros rather than pay for it to sit idle

5473910 bottom line things have to get much worse to pass the recession threshold
5473911 is to take the guesswork out of the recession definition
5473912 every recession since world war ii has included months that satisfied all three of these limits and there has never been a time in the expansions during which all three of these limits were satisfied
5473913 the problems in industrial production are nowhere close to the limit

5474121 international billing is a significant project and not something we are comfortable focusing on before we have a dependable offering
5474122 its not right to charge for spotty service and we know there are bugs

5474292 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5474293 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5474294 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5474308 we dont know why we had so many arrests on this particular sting

5474334 by 1865 telegraph cables spanned continents and oceans revolutionizing the ways countries dealt with one another the telegraph gave rise to creative business practices and new forms of crime romances blossomed over the wires secret codes were devised by some users and cracked by others
5474335 government regulators tried and failed to control the new medium and attitudes toward everything from news gathering to war had to be completely rethought
5474336 the telegraph unleashed the greatest revolution in communications since the development of the printing press

5474344 see it as a long term investment part of real estate for them is owning a piece of new york
5474345 the flatiron is expensive but with the cheap dollar it made sense to increase our share
5474346 the stability of the new york real estate market is unique this current crisis will pass and the dollar will re establish itself we are confident
5474347 this isnt just about the dollar the strongest driver is that investors are looking for geographical diversification the same situation played out on wall street about 10 to 15 years ago

5474357 this site was not just about holding images it was about a group of individuals who used this as a community to then jump off into other areas it was a meeting point
5474358 this website while appearing to operate on the margins of legality was clearly a front for the sinister sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for paedophiles

5474394 its a shame that something that americans rely on every day is so complex the government at least ought to make them products that are more easy to understand
5474395 credit cards can be a convenient pressure valve for families to take the pressure off of their everyday expenses thats why reform is so necessary
5474396 the numbers that demonstrate that 82 percent of respondents see credit cards as essential is very telling
5474397 the concern with what policymakers are considering is that it will make this essential product too expensive for many consumers
5474398 the outrage has just been building its something thats finally coming to a head now
5474399 the public is fed up and its time for congress to enact credit card reforms that will put an end to unfair deceptive and abusive credit card practices
5474400 the credit card industry has been given ample opportunity to police itself
5474401 i have a hard time wading through it and this is my specialty
5474402 how do you expect someone who may not have gone to college
5474403 the fact that 78 percent of respondents say they dont really read the terms and conditions probably lends itself to feelings of mistrust and further demonstrates the need for greater financial education and more meaningful disclosures weve said many times the disclosures can and should be improved
5474404 better disclosure is only going to tell them better how they are being abused
5474405 the aba and the large credit card companies have tremendous amount of clout and the very best people in the business lobbying on capitol hill were fighting some huge and powerful lobbies and i dont know if that can be overcome or not
5474406 the bank lobbyists are running around d c back and forth between the fed and the congress like their hair is on fire trying to stop reasonable regulation thats all their own fault
5474407 wed never have convinced either the fed or the house financial services commitee to act except that the banks pushed too far change is in the air
5474408 with numbers like these i think you need something more than what the fed has proposed obviously people are upset with the current state of affairs
5474409 de weergoden waren ons gelukkig gunstig gezind daardoor was met name de zaterdag een hele drukke dag het is altijd moeilijk om een precies aantal te geven maar ik denk dat er in het afgelopen weekend dagelijks zo rond de 25 000 mensen zijn geweest

5474416 rabbi we know that you are a teacher come from god for no one can do these signs that you do unless god is with him
5474417 truly truly i say to you unless one is born anew he cannot see the kingdom of god
5474418 how can a man be born when he is old can he enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born
5474419 truly truly i say to you unless one is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god 6 that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit 7 do not marvel that i said to you you must be born anew 8 the wind blows where it wills and you hear the sound of it but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes so it is with every one who is born of the spirit
5474420 now my soul is troubled and what should i say father save me from this hour no it is for this reason that i have come to this hour 28 father glorify your name
5474421 i have glorified it and i will glorify it again
5474422 do you see these great buildings there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down

5474436 if you come near me im going to stab you
5474437 this study shows that number abilities are not simply based on culture or language associate professor reeve says
5474438 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5474439 we need to investigate ways in which we can add on to these building blocks to develop ways of teaching numeracy that are relevant to indigenous students culture he says
5474440 we also need to redefine the way we think about numeracy across the board moving away from the view that we need words to describe numbers and basic computations
5474441 if you imagine a chessboard on which the dark squares are shrubs and the light squares are grasses warming alone would tend to increase the size of the dark squares until the chess board is completely filled in
5474442 our experiment suggests that herbivores like caribou and muskoxen will slow this process inhibit it or perhaps even increase the size of the white squares on the chessboard
5474443 this discovery is quite surprising considering that muskoxen occur at such a low density at our site
5474444 careful management and conservation of existing populations of muskoxen and caribou as well as other large herbivores should be a priority in plans to mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystems
5474445 until now these animals seem to have been regarded more as background noise than as an active component of the ecosystems response to warming
5474446 our results suggest that herbivores in the arctic and elsewhere may constrain the increase in shrub growth that is projected by current models of global warming their grazing could have important consequences for the ability of shrubs to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide insect outbreaks may become more frequent with future warming as well and our results also suggest an important role of such outbreaks in reducing shrubs
5474447 on the practical and policy sides of this story we need to be aware that the carbon dioxide sponge represented especially by shrubs and trees may not be as big as we thought it was this finding is yet another reason to think carefully about reducing carbon dioxide emissions
5474448 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5474449 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5474450 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5474451 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defenses protecting the brain from infection
5474452 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5474453 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5474454 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5474455 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
5474456 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5474457 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream
5474458 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb
5474459 safe or safety means that there is reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use
5474460 complete certainty of absolute harmlessness is scientifically impossible to establish
5474461 supports fdas position that data we have reviewed up until this time support the safety of the currently permitted uses of bpa in food contact material
5474462 the most up to date analysis on the safety of bisphenol a in the world
5474463 the ntp language was some concern and people tended to focus on the word concern without realizing or really thinking through that theres a qualifier up front some
5474464 at a minimum would decide to reduce the reference dose
5474465 we have long since lost faith in fdas ability to be an impartial authority on fdas safety time and again fda has sided with special interests instead of the public interest on this chemical
5474466 if its a way to delay any decision on bpa its really frustrating
5474467 with bisphenol a we already know so much about it its not likely that anyones going to do an experiment tomorrow that will render everything that we know today wrong
5474468 canada really took the lead and said this is what the precautionary principle looks like
5474469 it will be interesting to see how it plays out
5474470 if you dig into the details of the science you find that theyre really quite similar canada ntp europe none of them found those studies to be really compelling none found them to be really suitable for making any kind of real conclusion
5474471 at this time fda is not recommending that anyone discontinue using products that contain bpa while we continue our risk assessment process however concerned consumers should know that several alternatives to polycarbonate baby bottles exist including glass baby bottles

5474481 what georgian authorities have done is beyond human understanding it cannot be understood and left unpunished
5474482 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation

5474493 we welcome the fdas draft bpa risk assessment as its findings once again support the overwhelming body of scientific evidence that confirms the safety of bpa in food packaging for all consumers
5474494 bpa has been safely used in food contact applications for 50 years and plays an essential role in keeping foods safe and fresh
5474495 several other prominent international bodies have also agreed with fda regarding the safety of bpa these include the world health organization health and consumer protection directorate of the european commission the european chemical bureau of the european union the european scientific panel on food additives flavorings processing aids and materials in contact with food and the japanese national institute of advanced industrial science and technology

5474519 i recall john telling that story when we first got together in 1971 when were talking about every conceivable thing that had ever happened to us when we were in prison
5474520 most of us had been kept apart or in small groups then in 1970 they moved us into the big cell and when we all got to see each other and talk to each other directly instead of tapping through walls we had 24 hours a day seven days a week to talk to each other and we shared stories i vaguely recall that story being told among other stories
5474521 there were several stories similar to that in which guards a very few i might add showed compassion to the prisoners it was rare and i never met one but some of the guys did

5474523 belligerent measures taken by a nation to prevent passage of vessels or aircraft to and from another country customary international law recognizes blockades as an act of war because of the belligerent use of force even against third party nations in enforcing the blockade blockades as acts of war have been recognized as such in the declaration of paris of 1856 and the declaration of london of 1909 that delineate the international rules of warfare
5474524 as part of general international law and customary international law
5474525 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
5474526 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
5474527 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land
5474528 a blockade of coastal states that had joined the confederacy at the outset of the civil war the court explicitly ruled that a blockade is an act of war and is legal only if properly authorized under the constitution
5474529 the power of declaring war is the highest sovereign power and is limited to the representative of the full sovereignty of the nation it is limited in the united states to its congress exclusively and the authority of the president to be the commander in chief to take that the law be faithfully executed is to be taken in connection with the exclusive power given to congress to declare war and does not enable the president to do it or to introduce without act of congress war or any of its legal disabilities or liabilities on any citizen of the united states

5474552 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage but that is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign not a single period of time

5474559 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
5474560 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
5474561 randomized blinded placebo controlled clinical trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
5474562 it has also been suggested that the incidence of scarring from facial acne approaches 95 percent thus adolescents marked preference for total clearance over partial 50 percent clearance or clearance with scarring suggests that physicians must weigh high patient expectations against these clinical data

5474625 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5474626 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5474627 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5474628 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5474629 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5474630 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5474631 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one

5474684 on the way down i pick a black eyed susan as i saw a lady in a yellow dress on the way up and figured she would like it this is insane i an zooming this decent holding on to this flower and you know i didnt think anything of it the lady that i gave the matching flower to nodded so did i and on i zoomed her day 100 better and i stole her energy
5474685 this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands in tax breaks for people earning 2 5 million because theyre only middle class
5474686 everyone making 2 5 million or more raise your hands
5474687 i think if youre just talking about income how about five million
5474688 the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
5474689 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs have shown great progress
5474690 this guy obviously does not pump his own gas he obviously does not do his own shopping he obviously does not pay his own bills
5474691 but american politics is never that easy weve got to work hard weve got to earn this election
5474692 we now can study how iaps contribute to the development of cancer in a living animal and develop drugs to prevent or thwart the disease
5474693 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die
5474694 by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
5474695 we need to use genetics to sort out which individual iaps contribute to tumors and which iaps we need to target in order to cure cancer
5474696 this was a very big step in understanding what role iaps play in cancer but it isnt the last
5474697 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5474698 public disclosures by the government and at amp t indicate that at amp t is assisting the government to implement some kind of surveillance program
5474699 dismissing this case at the outset would sacrifice liberty for no apparent enhancement of security
5474700 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5474701 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5474702 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5474703 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5474704 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5474705 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5474706 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5474707 creates shell lawyer web sites and then sells the leads that come in from those sites to lawyers
5474708 absent any further appeals we expect the restructuring to close by sept 30 2008
5474709 it is a fair expectation that somebody is going to apply for leave to appeal
5474710 its an issue of national importance which is the primary ground the supreme court of canada looks to
5474711 importance of the restructuring to the resolution of the abcp liquidity crisis and to the need to restore confidence in the financial system in canada

5474754 my mothers father worked as a carpenter on this particular day he was building some crates for the clothes his church was sending to orphanages in china on his way home he reached into his shirt pocket to find his glasses but they were gone when he mentally replayed his earlier actions he realized what had happened the glasses had slipped out of his pocket unnoticed and fallen into one of the crates which he had nailed shut his brand new glasses were heading for china the great depression was at its height and grandpa had six children he had spent 20 for those glasses that very morning he was upset by the thought of having to buy another pair its not fair he told god as he drove home in frustration ive been very faithful in giving of my time and money to your work and now this months later the director of the orphanage was on furlough in the united states he wanted to visit all the churches that supported him in china so he came to speak one sunday at my grandfathers small church in chicago the missionary began by thanking the people for their faithfulness in supporting him but most of all he said i must thank you for the glasses you sent last you see the communists had just swept through the orphanage destroying everything including my glasses i was desperate even if i had the money there was simply no way of replacing those glasses along with not being able to see well i experienced headaches every day so my coworkers and i were much in prayer about this then your crates arrived when my staff removed the covers they found a pair of glasses lying on top the missionary paused long enough to let his words sink in then still gripped with the wonder of it all he continued folks when i tried on the glasses it was as though they had been custom made just for me i want to thank you for being a part of that the people listened happy for the miraculous glasses but the missionary surely must have confused their church with another they thought there were no glasses on their list of items to be sent overseas but sitting quietly in the back with tears streaming down his face an ordinary carpenter realized the master carpenter had used him in an extraordinary way there are times we want to blame god instead of thanking him
5474755 john mccain will protect the creative industries from piracy the entertainment industry is both a vital sector of the domestic economy and among the largest us exporters
5474756 while the internet has provided tremendous opportunity for the creators of copyrighted works including music and movies to distribute their works around the world at low cost it has also given rise to a global epidemic of piracy john mccain supports efforts to crack down on piracy both on the internet and off
5474757 not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
5474758 the applied for mark merely describes a feature and characteristic of applicants services

5474760 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5474761 you dont pass that sort of legislation unless theres some sort of intent to use it
5474762 were certainly poised and ready when market conditions are appropriate
5474763 continues to exceed our regulatory capital requirements we continue to provide stability and liquidity to the housing market and we will continue to play a key role as the market recovers from this cycle

5474782 there is no need for opec or the oil companies to help us out
5474783 every driver can affect change simply by easing up on their right foot
5474784 the public isnt real excited about going back to a 55 mph national speed limit
5474785 all we would do by establishing another national speed limit is we would generate a lot of tickets a lot of insurance surcharges and give a little boost to the radar detector industry

5474787 when youre in an airplane you dont want your fuel to start solidifying
5474788 so we have a bit of a chicken and egg problem
5474789 were looking for something that is so correct in its performance that it can be interchanged with petroleum based kerosene
5474790 from a distribution standpoint from a technical standpoint it needs to fit without modifications or special handling
5474791 it can be grown anywhere you can have a pool of water and expose it to sunlight
5474792 if anyone is below 50 a gallon id be stunned
5474793 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
5474794 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today
5474795 even if we were to double the volume we were to make in biofuels every year for the next 10 years were still looking at maybe this will impact 15 of the overall fuel supply
5474796 realistically for anything to be happening at scale enough to actually impact an airlines bottom line were years away

5474798 the people that lived in and around park and ride lots brilliantly set it up 30 years ago it has worked beautifully ever since then
5474799 in fact we have had states as far away as california call us and say what is this thing called slugging how does it work how do you set it up the fact of the matter is vdot had nothing to do with it it is just one of those incredible phenomena

5474802 the hov lanes on i 95 and i 395 are probably the most successful hov lanes in the country
5474803 that is going to be even more of an incentive to get into a carpool or consider slugging

5474810 this is the first study to comprehensively look at a large population of infected persons to study the long term effects of west nile virus

5474812 the objectives were to provide product trial among a key physician group to accelerate uptake of vioxx as the second entrant in a highly competitive new class
5474813 i dont think people would be willing to risk side effects if they knew that the aim of a clinical trial was to boost profits for a pharmaceutical company
5474814 i would think that at some level this is standard practice

5474818 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5474819 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5474820 we all want to know whats going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
5474821 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5474822 thats the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system
5474823 it allows us to assess the response of one animal to a variety of conditions and gives us much more valuable information
5474824 a lot of research efforts are devoted to the basic science of stem cells
5474825 this work is focused on the immediate practicalities of actually using these cells therapeutically
5474826 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
5474827 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
5474828 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
5474829 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
5474830 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies

5474834 was in a panel the other day with rick warren some of you may have seen it and rick warren asked him how do you define rich
5474835 he said maybe he was joking he said 5 million
5474836 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million

5474855 there are a lot of americans in israel who are familiar with the ou name and will feel comfortable buying chickens supervised by us
5474856 one kashrut supervisor will adopt a new stringency to set itself apart from the others as if to say look i am more holy than they are
5474857 ive seen five different supervisors examine one chickens lungs and give five different reasons why it is trayf
5474858 the impression i get from ou is that they are more reasonable instead of checking the lungs of every single chicken they are willing to rely on a test sample
5474859 they were later misled by the institutions in which they studied
5474860 the idf and the chief rabbinate agreed to recognize that study i dont know what all the fuss is about

5474936 most of us had been kept apart or in small groups then in 1970 they moved us into the big cell and when we all got to see each other and talk to each other directly instead of tapping through walls we had 24 hours a day seven days a week to talk to each other and we shared stories i vaguely recall that story being told among other stories

5475036 kalau hendak muzakarah juga kita tanya mereka sebab apa tidak mahu menerima islam dalam semua aspek kehidupan termasuk ekonomi dan budaya kita kena tanya mereka di mana tidak kena islam sehingga umno tidak mahu menerimanya
5475037 hanya ini sahaja yang boleh kalau kita hendak muzakarah dengan umno
5475038 saya hendak tanya siapa yang tidak berikan kalau tidak umno yang sejak dari dahulu lagi tidak mahu orang ramai mendengar ceramah agama
5475039 jadi buat apa kita hendak berunding juga dengan mereka yang tidak mahu membenarkan orang ramai mendengar ceramah agama
5475040 saya pun hairan satu pihak hendak berunding dengan umno dan satu pihak lagi hendak perkukuhkan pakatan rakyat macam mana boleh berlaku sedemikian ini menggelirukan orang ramai
5475041 kalau umno tiada di muka dunia ini orang melayu pun tidak rosak di lima negeri yang dikuasai pakatan rakyat sekarang orang melayu pun boleh hidup juga

5475101 i think after the 2007 season our team realizes we have to work harder to earn wins
5475102 they showed us between january and may when we finished up our spring season that theyve bought into it and theyre ready to put it on the field
5475103 this group has lasted and theyve had a great amount of fortitude to get to this point and for me personally theres nothing id like to see more than that group finish their careers here on an up note and i think theyre feeling the same way
5475104 our junior sophomore and freshman classes combined have a ton of talent and they add to the talent and experience of our seniors you cant put too much on the shoulders of freshmen because theyve done great things before they arrived on campus
5475105 we certainly have high expectations for them but at the same time those expectations have to be realistic its the returners who have to carry the group we think we have a freshman class that can really put the icing on the cake for us
5475106 the key for us is finishing games and learning how to win games
5475107 everything in between weve been very good at the last three years being a goal scoring team that doesnt give up soft goals has to be our mantra and that will give us more wins than in past years
5475108 were confident that we have the talent at this position to do well
5475109 alex phillips has made a ton of progress in the off season but she doesnt have a full collegiate season under her belt we have a lot of confidence in kari that shes going to be a great goalkeeper but its hard to put that kind of pressure on a freshman particularly at a pressure position like goalkeeper
5475110 i feel well be much improved at that spot alex has the most collegiate game experience but thats just a couple games in the fall and the spring
5475111 she has to get in there and make her experience be the difference between her and the next two
5475112 thats the place where we were most proud of our improvement in the off season
5475113 i think that group is as solid as weve seen them in past years weve sorted some things out by moving kendyl pele from the outside to the inside shes a physical specimen and just a tremendous athlete
5475114 lindsey kasser was all world in the spring so putting her and kendyl pele in the center of the back really helps us
5475115 getting dana stirn back finally and getting her speed back on the outside has really helped us as well
5475116 we have depth and some quality players who will push for roles in the back
5475117 but those four are going to be tough to beat out
5475118 thats the place where we will probably have the most competition especially in the center of the midfield
5475119 its a really really deep position for us and a really talented position where we should be able to and expect to dominate other teams
5475120 nikki had the best spring of all our center midfielders after making the transition
5475121 you throw jenna robison in there who is very talented and skillful chelsea bumbaugh who has played a significant amount of minutes in her first two years here and two sophomores jane mitchell and sara turcios who are very talented and they are going to get after each other for time
5475122 melissa has shown she can score goals so her consistency and her ability to play significant minutes is going to determine whats going to happen on our front line
5475123 mckenna waitley probably had the best overall spring of anyone on our team
5475124 any type of competition or games or scrimmage against an outside opponent she was a factor in everything shes going to be able to come in and do some great things for us
5475125 they are both physically very capable freshmen who we can get some production out of
5475126 its exciting for us to have new people in just about every position blended with veterans who know the expectations
5475127 i feel a difficult schedule pays off in the long run
5475128 our goal as a program has never been to just be a tournament team when we get to the tournament we want to win we want to go as far as we can and challenge for a national championship and win the pac 10 and weve shown were capable of doing both

5475200 der trainer hat mich einberufen damit ich dem team helfe ich f hle schon etwas druck weil man von mir mehr erwartet als von den jungen burschen aber ich gebe mein bestes ich glaube dass man mit harter arbeit keine entt uschungen erlebt und die gew nschten ergebnisse sich von selbst einstellen
5475201 wir haben uns sehr gesteigert das sieht man schon an unseren ergebnissen
5475202 wir haben im ersten spiel kein tor erzielt die zweite und die dritte partie haben wir mit 2 1 gewonnen und im viertelfinale waren wir zwei mal erfolgreich und haben keinen gegentreffer kassiert
5475203 noch k nnen wir nicht zufrieden sein wir wissen dass wir in der abwehr noch besser werden m ssen es ist aber nun einmal unsere veranlagung nach vorne zu spielen um ein tor zu erzielen deswegen haben wir in der vergangenheit oft die deckung fallen lassen was unserem trainer berhaupt nicht gefallen hat er hat uns deutlich vor augen gef hrt dass wir besser organisiert stehen und eine geschlossene mannschaftsleistung abliefern m ssen wenn wir erfolgreich sein wollen
5475204 sie haben eine starke mannschaft und das ergebnis gegen italien spricht f r sich sie haben bislang mehr erreicht als viele menschen in belgien geglaubt h tten wir werden uns jedoch auf unser spiel konzentrieren um ins finale zu kommen und uns nicht allzu viele gedanken um den gegner machen

5475274 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

5475287 certain rights the president of maldives receives and his rights as commander in chief
5475288 wherever he travels to president maumoon makes all decisions in the presidents office meaning the presidents office goes wherever the president goes
5475289 the campaign will be paid through drp but the president will receive his rights from the government during the presidents travel he will claim those rights

5475294 gayoom continues to pillage the national treasury for his political campaign despite recent reports that the government faced a us 342 million budget deficit

5475301 wherefore it is fitting that you should run together in accordance with the will of your bishop which thing also you do for your justly renowned presbytery worthy of god is fitted as exactly to the bishop as the strings are to the harp therefore in your concord and harmonious love jesus christ is sung and man by man become a choir that being harmonious in love and taking up the song of god in unison you may with one voice sing to the father through jesus christ so that he may both hear you and perceive by your works that you are indeed the members of his son it is profitable therefore that you should live in an unblameable unity that thus you may always enjoy communion with god
5475302 for if i in this brief space of time have enjoyed such fellowship with your bishop i mean not of a mere human but of a spiritual nature how much more do i reckon you happy who are so joined to him as the church is to jesus christ and as jesus christ is to the father that so all things may agree in unity
5475303 let us be careful then not to set ourselves in opposition to the bishop in order that we may be subject to god
5475304 now the more any one sees the bishop keeping silence the more ought he to revere him for we ought to receive every one whom the master of the house sends to be over his household matt 24 25 as we would do him that sent him it is manifest therefore that we should look upon the bishop even as we would upon the lord himself and indeed onesimus himself greatly commends your good order in god that you all live according to the truth and that no sect has any dwelling place among you nor indeed do ye hearken to any one rather than to jesus christ speaking in truth
5475305 for when you assemble frequently in the same place the powers of satan are destroyed and the destruction at which he aims is prevented by the unity of your faith nothing is more precious than peace by which all war both in heaven and earth is brought to an end
5475306 so that ye obey the bishop and the presbytery with an undivided mind breaking one and the same bread which is the medicine of immortality and the antidote to prevent us from dying but which causes that we should live for ever in jesus christ
5475307 since there is one bread we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one bread
5475308 since then i have had the privilege of seeing you through damas your most worthy bishop and through your worthy presbyters bassus and apollonius and through my fellow servant the deacon sotio whose friendship may i ever enjoy inasmuch as he is subject to the bishop as to the grace of god and to the presbytery as to the law of jesus christ i now write to you
5475309 now it becomes you also not to treat your bishop too familiarly on account of his youth but to yield him all reverence having respect to the power of god the father as i have known even holy presbyters do not judging rashly from the manifest youthful appearance of their bishop but as being themselves prudent in god submitting to him or rather not to him but to the father of jesus christ the bishop of us all it is therefore fitting that you should after no hypocritical fashion obey your bishop in honour of him who has willed us so to do since he that does not so deceives not by such conduct the bishop that is visible but seeks to mock him that is invisible and all such conduct has reference not to man but to god who knows all secrets
5475310 it is fitting then not only to be called christians but to be so in reality as some indeed give one the title of bishop but do all things without him now such persons seem to me to be not possessed of a good conscience seeing they are not steadfastly gathered together according to the commandment
5475311 since therefore i have in the persons before mentioned beheld the whole multitude of you in faith and love i exhort you to study to do all things with a divine harmony while your bishop presides in the place of god and your presbyters in the place of the assembly of the apostles along with your deacons who are most dear to me and are entrusted with the ministry of jesus christ who was with the father before the beginning of time and in the end was revealed do ye all then imitating the same divine conduct pay respect to one another and let no one look upon his neighbour after the flesh but do ye continually love each other in jesus christ let nothing exist among you that may divide you but be ye united with your bishop and those that preside over you as a type and evidence of your immortality
5475312 as therefore the lord did nothing without the father being united to him neither by himself nor by the apostles so neither do ye anything without the bishop and presbyters neither endeavour that anything appear reasonable and proper to yourselves apart but being come together into the same place let there be one prayer one supplication one mind one hope in love and in joy undefiled
5475313 therefore run together as into one temple of god as to one altar as to one jesus christ who came forth from one father and is with and has gone to one
5475314 with your most admirable bishop and the well compacted spiritual crown of your presbytery and the deacons who are according to god be subject to the bishop and to one another as jesus christ to the father according to the flesh and the apostles to christ and to the father and to the spirit that so there may be a union both fleshly and spiritual
5475315 i know that you possess an unblameable and sincere mind in patience and that not only in present practice but according to inherent nature as polybius your bishop has shown me who has come to smyrna by the will of god and jesus christ and so sympathized in the joy which i who am bound in christ jesus possess that i beheld your whole multitude in him
5475316 for since you are subject to the bishop as to jesus christ you appear to me to live not after the manner of men but according to jesus christ who died for us in order by believing in his death you may escape from death it is therefore necessary that as you indeed do so without the bishop you should do nothing but should also be subject to the presbytery as to the apostle of jesus christ who is our hope in whom if we live we shall at last be found it is fitting also that the deacons as being the ministers of the mysteries of jesus christ should in every respect be pleasing to all for they are not ministers of meat and drink but servants of the church of god they are bound therefore to avoid all grounds of accusation against them as they would do fire
5475317 in like manner let all reverence the deacons as an appointment of jesus christ and the bishop as jesus christ who is the son of the father and the presbyters as the sanhedrim of god and assembly of the apostles apart from these there is no church concerning all this i am persuaded that you are of the same opinion for i have received the manifestation of your love and still have it with me in your bishop whose very appearance is highly instructive and his meekness of itself a power whom i imagine even the ungodly must reverence seeing they are also pleased that i do not spare myself
5475318 be on your guard therefore against such persons i e hertics and this will be the case with you if you are not puffed up and continue in intimate union with jesus christ our god and the bishop and the enactments of the apostles he that is within the altar is pure but he that is without is not pure that is he who does anything apart from the bishop and presbytery and deacons such a man is not pure in his conscience
5475319 jesus christ our god and the bishop and the enactments of the apostles
5475320 continue in harmony among yourselves and in prayer with one another for it becomes every one of you and especially the presbyters to refresh the bishop to the honour of the father of jesus christ and of the apostles
5475321 fare well in jesus christ while you continue subject to the bishop as to the command of god and in like manner to the presbytery
5475322 that god has deemed me the bishop of syria worthy to be sent for from the east unto the west
5475323 remember in your prayers the church in syria which now has god for its shepherd instead of me
5475324 wherefore as children of light and truth flee from division and wicked doctrines but where the shepherd is there follow as sheep for there are many wolves that appear worthy of credit who by means of a pernicious pleasure carry captive 2 timothy 3 6 those that are running towards god but in your unity they shall have no place
5475325 keep yourselves from those evil plants which jesus christ does not tend because they are not the planting of the father not that i have found any division among you but exceeding purity for as many as are of god and of jesus christ are also with the bishop and as many as shall in the exercise of repentance return into the unity of the church these too shall belong to god that they may live according to jesus christ do not err my brethren if any man follows him that makes a schism in the church he shall not inherit the kingdom of god if any one walks according to a strange opinion he agrees not with the passion of christ
5475326 for as many as are of god and of jesus christ are also with the bishop
5475327 take heed then to have but one eucharist for there is one flesh of our lord jesus christ and one cup to show forth the unity of his blood one altar as there is one bishop along with the presbytery and deacons my fellow servants that so whatsoever you do you may do it according to the will of god
5475328 for when i was among you i cried i spoke with a loud voice give heed to the bishop and to the presbytery and deacons now some suspected me of having spoken thus as knowing beforehand the division caused by some among you but he is my witness for whose sake i am in bonds that i got no intelligence from any man but the spirit proclaimed these words do nothing without the bishop keep your bodies as the temples of god love unity avoid divisions be the followers of jesus christ even as he is of his father
5475329 giving heed to the bishop the presbytery and the deacons
5475330 i therefore did what belonged to me as a man devoted to unity for where there is division and wrath god does not dwell to all them that repent the lord grants forgiveness if they turn in penitence to the unity of god and to communion with the bishop
5475331 as also the nearest churches have sent in some cases bishops and in others presbyters and deacons
5475332 but avoid all divisions as the beginning of evils see that you all follow the bishop even as jesus christ does the father and the presbytery as you would the apostles and reverence the deacons as being the institution of god let no man do anything connected with the church without the bishop let that be deemed a proper eucharist which is administered either by the bishop or by one to whom he has entrusted it wherever the bishop shall appear there let the multitude of the people also be even as wherever jesus christ is there is the catholic church it is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love feast but whatsoever he shall approve of that is also pleasing to god so that everything that is done may be secure and valid
5475333 it is well to reverence both god and the bishop he who honours the bishop has been honoured by god he who does anything without the knowledge of the bishop does in reality serve the devil
5475334 i salute your most worthy bishop and your very venerable presbytery and your deacons my fellow servants and all of you individually as well as generally in the name of jesus christ and in his flesh and blood in his passion and resurrection both corporeal and spiritual in union with god and you
5475335 if the man who chooses to remain a virgin for christ begins to boast he is undone and if he reckon himself greater than the bishop he is ruined but it becomes both men and women who marry to form their union with the approval of the bishop that their marriage may be according to god and not after their own lust
5475336 give heed to the bishop that god also may give heed to you my soul be for theirs that are submissive to the bishop to the presbyters and to the deacons and may my portion be along with them in god
5475337 it is fitting o polycarp most blessed in god to assemble a very solemn council and to elect one whom you greatly love and know to be a man of activity who may be designated the messenger of god and to bestow on him this honour that he may go into syria and glorify your ever active love to the praise of christ

5475345 the best thing about a large army and a strong navy is that they make it so much easier to say just what we want to say in our diplomatic correspondence

5475350 high energy prices across the economy rising air fares and airline schedule cuts are the primary drivers of the overall reduction in passenger volumes expected for this labor day period
5475351 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and business travelers are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all
5475352 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5475353 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5475354 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5475355 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5475356 signs of not getting enough sleep or sleeping poorly include consistently taking more than 30 minutes to fall asleep awakening more than a few times or for long periods each night feeling sleepy during the day or having trouble concentrating at school or at work
5475357 i think the french will undoubtedly be seeking from the russians an explanation for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5475358 i think everybody recognizes that this is not the first time that weve seen this problem
5475359 weve had russian strategic aviation challenging even along borders with the united states which i might note is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5475360 the hope had been that russia was going to build its foundation and relationships with europe and the united states on the basis of russian economic political cultural and other kinds of assets
5475361 and reminding people that bears can fly near norway or near alaska and that you can use military force against a small neighbor is not a particularly appealing message or image
5475362 they are destroying everything and then pulling out of these places
5475363 if they call this a pullout then i do not understand the meaning of the word
5475364 i can say for certain when the new year will come but i cannot give an exact date for the withdrawal of our troops from the conflict area yet
5475365 i can only say that we will not be leaving as fast as we came
5475366 there are no signs at all that russian forces are pulling out
5475367 quite the opposite they are spreading out to other regions
5475368 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5475369 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5475370 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of 2001 september 11 2001
5475371 obviously its a fragile situation in pakistan because its a new civilian government for the first time in a long time in pakistan since 1999 and so our effort is to support that government strengthen it
5475372 u s policy must focus on assuring that all elements of pakistans government are resolute in shutting down the safe havens for al qaeda and the taliban
5475373 pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5475374 the war against extremism is bigger than any one person
5475375 child your countenance is that of one with no sanguine expectations you are young yet face the hurt of an elder who clasps his hands upon his chest what do you want from me writhing one
5475376 is there hope to wait for will i ever feel the same uttering such a word that is now lightly used by many who know nothing of it do you know anything of what i speak what will become of me
5475377 the man of stone knows it well for with it in hand he was softened with the loss of it he was hardened
5475378 so i am to feel nothing like you then there is no hope
5475379 the stone upon what is soft chips wind can sweep it away like chaff
5475380 what man whose breast is struck does not raise his shield he heals and fights with a much stronger guard you will be this man much like the many men before you and after you youre feelings from now on will be premeditated and your defense will be increased
5475381 it is not up to your discretion your heart is petrified within and without it is stone
5475382 so i will not feel it ever you confuse me golem i am broken can you shed no light for me in my time of darkness
5475383 i just dont see you as beautiful but then i was never raised to see black women that way
5475384 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5475385 no matter what i did i couldnt make her happy anymore
5475386 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5475387 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5475388 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5475389 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5475390 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5475391 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5475392 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5475393 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5475394 its not acceptable for us even though some of them didnt play this long that long
5475395 you can have all kinds of excuses we have to clean that up coaching staff weve got to do a better job there
5475396 they knew it after they got the penalty but we cant have it beforehand those things were harping on certainly
5475397 if it doesnt go well i think you should look at the coach because if the country is not happy with the way andrew bogut is playing ive gone along the same game plan since ive had the team

5475406 certain rights the president of maldives receives and his rights as commander in chief
5475407 wherever he travels to president maumoon makes all decisions in the presidents office meaning the presidents office goes wherever the president goes
5475408 the campaign will be paid through drp but the president will receive his rights from the government during the presidents travel he will claim those rights
5475409 wherever the president goes security is a must its a priority
5475410 there will be a budget for election but i dont know about political parties
5475411 considers that excessive state funds have been used in gayooms campaign visits to outlying atolls
5475412 the excessive abuse by president maumoon abdul gayoom of official vessels cars and other state resources for his re election bid are in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of his duties in the public interest
5475413 gayoom continues to pillage the national treasury for his political campaign despite recent reports that the government faced a us 342 million budget deficit
5475414 on a small island there were three defence force crafts one big enough to hold vehicles two other crafts in the lagoon two police speedboats and a huge yacht
5475415 obviously any president would require a security detail but it doesnt mean he needs to take a whole contingent of armed forces to ensure rallies by dragging people out of their houses
5475416 can you see the harbour constructed in 30 years of rule

5475418 its not a new theme but on the other hand the track record of gms incentive programs has been very good
5475419 from gms perspective its key to clear out the 2008 models before the 09s start to roll out
5475420 the government has conveyed to me that the issuance of an arrest warrant against president bashir could have serious consequences for u n staff and infrastructure in sudan
5475421 we are taking all necessary precautionary measures including strengthening our cooperation with sudanese security institutions
5475422 the fact of the matter is that there was a breakdown of local command and control instructions of high officials were simply ignored by local commanders
5475423 when two regular armies fight each other with tanks multi barrel rocket launchers artillery and heavy machine guns then irrespective of the specific number of peacekeepers assigned to abyei there is no way they can actively intervene to suppress the fighting
5475424 how the vacuum is handled by the civilian government how much control they can exercise on the radical elements remains to be seen
5475425 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5475426 india will continue to have an amicable relation with pakistan in the days to come
5475427 after four good years in which india had high hopes for the peace process in the last four months the opposite has happened
5475428 musharraf was seen by india as decisive and ready to engage compared with the chaos and division of the last few months
5475429 the isi enjoyed greater autonomy since musharrafs wings were clipped
5475430 once he is removed from the scene isi may have even greater autonomy
5475431 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view
5475432 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on pak istan afghan border but clearly our side of the border too
5475433 well have to wait to see how the dust settles
5475434 if the resignation of musharraf leads to the primacy of the civilian leaders or to the primacy of the isi and the army
5475435 i wish i could fire shots to show my joy but unfortunately i cant do that
5475436 thank god hes resigned the country will do much better now its a victory for the people
5475437 the country was doing better economically but now the politicians wont be able to preserve the economy and things will get worse
5475438 im not very hopeful these politicians will again indulge in political bickering i dont think they will bring down prices
5475439 the differences are fairly wide though we have made a lot of progress today on a percentage of questions
5475440 this is a make or break situation for the osce
5475441 if we dont get an agreement now on the monitors then there is a chance that other organizations will be quicker and do it first and then there is no role left for the osce to play in monitoring
5475442 georgian mothers are very brave and they are ready to send their children their sons to fight to defend their country
5475443 but georgian mothers as all mothers in the world have a right to know why they are doing this
5475444 im afraid it will not be very easy for the government to answer all the questions
5475445 it was impossible to imagine that russian tanks would be 20 25 minutes drive from tbilisi that we would have so many refugees and displaced persons and so many casualties among civilians
5475446 to show unity of the people is important to show that people are united and have hope and feeling that they will get through all difficulties
5475447 but this is one thing and celebration is another we have nothing to celebrate
5475448 once the war is over we will raise political questions and assess the military actions and mistakes so as not to repeat them
5475449 i am more than sure that right now i have to play a very active political role in the country
5475450 the government can now focus on the economy which is a refreshing change
5475451 the squabble with musharraf has created a system of paralysis
5475452 its a major victory for the new government but there is still a lot of uncertainty going forward
5475453 even though musharrafs resignation removes uncertainty the new team has started on a very poor footing as far as the economy and investors go
5475454 musharraf and his team were seen to be knowledgeable and professional on the economy this team does not appear to be that way
5475455 while john mccain is visiting titusville today holding a closed door meeting to talk about nasa issues the florida democratic party thought floridians might appreciate some straight talk about john mccains failed record on space issues
5475456 how can the space coast trust john mccain when he has failed us so many other times in the senate chairman mccain was the one man that could have stood up to prevent the space flight gap and save thousands of space coast jobs however as is the case with so many other issues mccain instead stood with president bush and to add insult to injury mccain fought against nasa funding calling it pork barrel spending
5475457 la victoria es imposible en afganist n hoy uno debe intentar negociar no hay otra soluci n
5475458 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5475459 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5475460 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5475461 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5475462 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5475463 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5475464 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5475465 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5475466 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5475467 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5475468 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5475469 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5475470 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5475471 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5475472 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5475473 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5475474 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5475475 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5475476 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5475477 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5475478 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5475479 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5475480 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5475481 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5475482 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5475483 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5475484 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5475485 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5475486 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5475487 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5475488 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5475489 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5475490 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5475491 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5475492 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5475493 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5475494 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5475495 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5475496 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5475497 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5475498 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5475499 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5475500 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5475563 gordon glover has created a delightfully readable yet comprehensive exploration of the relationship between the genesis narratives and the science of our day focusing on the context in which those narratives were given to humankind beyond the firmament combines clarity and wit honoring the word of god while respecting our understanding of gods world this is an impressive achievement for the author and a godsend for christians
5475564 the glove has some crocodile skin on the underside and my name means crocodile so i wear it when i jump
5475565 the track is very fast with the second jump i felt i was going to hurt myself so i just ran through with the third jump i just had to do it
5475566 i came to the games hoping to get into the finals and i went into the finals hoping to get any medal whether its a bronze silver or gold i just wanted to do well and the fact that god blessed me with the silver im very happy
5475567 i was hoping for a new pb 8 39m today that could have got a gold medal but it didnt happen and i just want to thank the lord that i got a medal its something for me to cherish for the rest of my life
5475568 we are very proud of his performance and achievement khotso has proved that indeed he is one of the best in the world he has done team sa and the country proud by putting us on the medal table
5475569 silvers a win for khotso a win for athletics and a win for south africa
5475570 i would just like south africa to have more faith in our team and be more positive about us we have had six athletes compete so far and four have made the finals and now we have a silver medal its time that the potential of the team is recognised
5475571 he saved the whole of team south africa and im really pleased for him
5475572 the world is hungry for both protein and petroleum and the american corn grower can help satisfy both in the form of energy from ethanol and protein from corn fed red meat and poultry
5475573 across rural america an industry is still in development to turn our corn into ethanol in the process it is creating jobs that give our young people a chance to come back to their home communities it is improving the tax base that supports our local schools and government services it is pumping renewed economic life into the main streets and prompting new local businesses
5475574 ethanol in addition to the rapidly growing wind industry offers our nation a significant opportunity to begin the important diversification our energy portfolio away from fossil fuels
5475575 this diversification of risk in our nations energy portfolio is creating wealth in our own country and beginning to stem if every so slightly the massive transfer of energy dollars to other countries now totaling over 700 billion dollars annually
5475576 its also the ninth case in an animal born after canadas 1997 feed ban and the eighth case born after march 1 1999 a date usda u s department of agriculture uses to try to convince us that any canadian cattle born after that date are safe to import into the united states
5475577 this particular animal would have been eligible for export to the u s and that should concern everyone
5475578 for quite some time now canada has not been testing herd mates of infected cattle to see if there might be other cases of bse in a particular herd and the u
5475579 cfias mantra that every new bse case in canada was identified by the national bse surveillance program which has been highly successful in demonstrating the low level of bse in canada is simply absurd in the extreme
5475580 of course its true that all the bse cases detected in canada have been through cfias surveillance cfia doesnt allow anyone else to test for bse but that hardly means that cfias testing program has been highly successful in demonstrating the low level of bse in canada the program instead has definitively shown that canada and the u s have inaccurately predicted numerous times over the past five years that bse has virtually been eliminated there
5475581 this fact demonstrates conclusively that the risk of importing bse cattle into the united states from canada is substantially greater than what usda has told the public
5475582 it is downright irresponsible for usda to continue to allow these older cattle that were born when bse was still circulating in the canadian feed system into the united states

5475585 i would hope that this initiative can bring an end to the conflict that we have had for several years the discussions indicate that that is going to happen
5475586 within the discussions we have made it quite clear to the amaury group that we respect their organizational rights in their events and we ask that they respect the uci in its authority according to its statutes
5475587 there are fundamental differences in opinion as to how the sport should develop between the uci and the organizers
5475588 my thoughts just before the first real college game of my life the honor of my race family and self are at stake
5475589 everyone is expecting me to do big things i will
5475590 does this mean that americans are less supportive of environmental protection than in the past i doubt it
5475591 environmentalism can have the connotation of extremism to many americans particularly outside of the northeast
5475592 i am not who i used to be it will not happen to me anymore
5475593 their low sex drive often has little to do with hormones or biology and a lot to do with the women in their lives men today often enough are angry at their wives
5475594 in the presence of a mismatch of desire all intimacy drops out on all levels in addition to the sexual couples stop having meaningful conversations
5475595 human males seem to be so constituted that they resist learning not to desire variety despite impediments such as christianity and the doctrine of sin judaism and the doctrine of mensch social science and the doctrines of repressed homosexuality and psychosexual immaturity evolutionary theories of monogamous pair bonding cultural and legal traditions that support and glorify monogamy
5475596 loss of coital interest engendered by monotony in a sexual relationship is probably the most constant factor in the loss of an aging males interest in sexual performance with his partner
5475597 such a man may be rejuvenated by having sexual intercourse with a younger woman although the young woman may not be as adept a lover as his wife

5475605 scotland have a young team with a great work ethic and players who are very keen to learn
5475606 i think they have the potential to develop into a really good international side in the next three to four years
5475607 because amr and nahy anil munkar and jihad in the path of allah are tribulation and trouble and when human beings are faced with them you would find some of them seeking safety from fitnah by turning away from what is obligatory upon them as allah said about the hypocrites
5475608 o allahs messenger im a man who can not restrain himself from women and im afraid to fall into trial because of the roman women give me permission to stay behind and dont lead me to temptation
5475609 all are forgiven except the owner of the red camel
5475610 and fight them on until there is no more fitnah shirk and kufr and there prevail justice and faith in allah
5475611 the assumption in the past was that either you know how to look or you dont
5475612 this is not true you can train people to look educators as well as artists know that
5475613 quite often when students miss a diagnosis they tell us they didnt look
5475614 we trained students to become literate in talking to patients but we didnt have a way to make them be visually literate
5475615 you can look at a face and observe certain aspects of it like lines on a face the colour of it the colour of the eyelids the colour of the lips
5475616 not only how to look at body and face but to look at patterns the work of jackson pollock has no face and no body so what is important is pattern recognition
5475617 they have to be able to look at the human being they have to be able to pick up cues that are not necessarily communicated verbally so much is not communicated verbally
5475618 the common factor here which is the human is so subjective the science that we practise is so subjective that you have to train the physician to be good at both the human brings the science and the art together

5475621 people are letting their own house and then renting something more suitable to their current needs
5475622 many households have sold their family homes and move into rental acommodation for six to twelve months in order to reassess the market before buying
5475623 rents have dropped due to the number of properties that being unable to be sold are now becoming available to rent
5475624 i hope these examples prove the business benefits that flexible working can bring and that they help inspire other organisations to follow suit
5475625 ive been a little surprised that there have not been more deals it is getting more difficult to find new resources in minerals metals and oil so i see more consolidation over the next couple of years scale is very important when you need to produce things more cheaply

5475659 so in a way there is a kind of poetic justice in the fact that the final result of maos cultural revolution is todays unheard of explosion of capitalist dynamics in china
5475660 maos attempt in the cultural revolution to wipe out the traces of capitalism ended up in its triumphant return
5475661 by this extensive democracy the party is fearlessly encouraging the broad masses to use the media of free airing of views big character posters great debates and extensive exchange of revolutionary experience to criticize and supervise the party and government leading institutions and leaders at all levels at the same time the peoples democratic rights are being fully realized in accordance with the principles of the paris commune without such an extensive democracy it would be impossible to initiate a genuine great proletarian cultural revolution

5475678 the russians treat it as a threat but they know its not going to work
5475679 will continue to work on this subject and discuss the problem
5475680 the deployment of the new missile defense forces in europe is aimed at russia
5475681 so fairy tales about deterring some rogue states with the help of these facilities do not work
5475682 it is possible to contrive a worst case cold warlike scenario of the us placing 500 rather than 10 interceptors in poland but thats the sort of thing it would take to give russia any real basis for concern
5475683 you may have noticed that we started running a test of display ads on select pages of the youtube mobile site in the u s and japan this is our first step in testing mobile advertising for youtube
5475684 will give you youtube viewers a new way to interact with content on the go while allowing us to learn how video viewers engage with mobile advertising our test advertisers will also have an additional branding tool at their disposal and the opportunity to reach the millions of people who visit youtube every day on their phones
5475685 there is zero confidence that we will not be entering another round of redundancies and a strong suspicion that this is one of the reasons behind the proposal
5475686 one wonders whether our talent for alienating customers is now being applied to staff
5475687 these proposals tell me that there is going to be a lot of vers voluntary early retirements a cull of middle management to me it just indicates that m amp s is desperate to save money
5475688 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5475689 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5475690 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5475691 no fair british person can be proud of that part of the history of the uk in iran
5475692 unfortunately the overall presence of the british in those years in the anglo persian and anglo iranian oil companies was disastrous for iran
5475693 we would like to have this interaction with the world
5475694 we would be more than happy to supply part of europes energy needs provided that this would be a two sided deal in some cases exchange of information science expertise can help this
5475695 otherwise who is going to be hurting more very easily i can say that the standard of living in european countries many western european countries when they will not have enough energy is going to be shattered in the long run
5475696 you will find many iranian elite members argue that oil for us historically has been a curse because it has slowed down the overall economic development of the country it has undermined social and political developments
5475697 personally i am not so sure whether iran without oil would have been different iran without oil would have had many other resources to look towards and develop
5475698 buyer is described as a twentysomething entrepreneur from suburban cleve

5475715 it s getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5475716 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5475717 we all want to know what s going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
5475718 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5475719 that s the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system
5475720 it allows us to assess the response of one animal to a variety of conditions and gives us much more valuable information
5475721 a lot of research efforts are devoted to the basic science of stem cells
5475722 this work is focused on the immediate practicalities of actually using these cells therapeutically

5475727 i hope the players will execute it correctly against the wallabies
5475728 we know were going to lose some matches but what irks is the way you lose the players know when they have to produce
5475729 we controlled the newlands match but we just did not do those extra things somewhere between the hotel and the stadium lady luck passed us by
5475730 he is such a good player that one must allow him a week to build confidence that is what were doing
5475731 it was the same referee with different interpretations of the laws in two different test matches
5475732 we no longer have the luxury to speak to the referee before matches
5475733 i dont know how to put it in a better way but its an unjust battle on the ground it seems we have to play illegally to become legal
5475734 anyone can hold that opinion well only know if he plays
5475735 i cant comment on it now the player who is there in smits position has my support
5475736 i was still wondering if it wasnt a joke but then i saw the blood bubbling out of his neck
5475737 satan said he is going to kill me if i dont kill them before the end of the day

5475742 i kept talking to him because i was scared he would lapse into a coma
5475743 i held his leg his eyes were open but i could see it was already too late
5475744 we have been confronted with a lot of school violence recently but nothing of this nature
5475745 well do everything in our power to control the situation and to prevent similar incidents
5475746 do you think there is any prospect mediation might help resolve if not the whole problem part of it
5475747 may well be the best way to resolve the problem

5475777 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5475778 we are about the same size i might be 1 inch taller i had the bike set up with a reba set at 100mm travel and i used a 60mm stem flipped and flat bars to heep the front end low and i used a thompson seat post with zero setback with this setup the fit was outstanding for seated power both on the flats and climbs it really allowed me to put the power down without feeling cramped the trade off was that when standing on sprints or big power climbs the handlebars felt a little high and i felt a little stretched to effectively put out big power however i did ride a friends medium and that felt the reverse to cramped to put out any real power seated and the 100mm stem he had made the bike feel scetchy on the decents we both agreed that the large was a better fit and the trade offs leaned in favor of the large i would also say that if you are set on using a 100mm stem the frame will be too big for you you would need to run a short stem and zero setback seatpost i guess to simplify we are right in between sizes and could ride either one but for the intended purpose of the rip9 i would opt for the larger size than the smaller

5475784 our knowledge base also remains the most flexible scalable and easy to implement knowledge management solution with a lower total cost of ownership than competitive tools
5475785 we do not need a stimulus plan which would be an artificial plan
5475786 we are not in a recession but we are feeling the effects of a brutal difficult crisis
5475787 the problem is that we have extremely limited room to manoeuvre because we have wasted quite a bit over the past year so maybe we should have the courage to put the fiscal package back on the table
5475788 this would asphyxiate the economy at a time when it frankly doesnt need this
5475789 after going through the budget on line heres what i discovered
5475790 oh yeah no the next movie im doing is my wwii movie bastards i actually just finished the first draft of the script and when i go home ill be finishing it up an d if all goes well i will be here 2009 at cannes with my war film bastards

5475794 absent any further appeals we expect the restructuring to close by sept 30 2008
5475795 i was extremely relieved to hear that the ontario court of appeal not only dismissed the appeal but did so in a unanimous way
5475796 i think were done here and should be moving forward
5475797 lets just drive on and dont hold us hostage any more
5475798 i dont hear of anybody eating cat food certainly theres still stress
5475799 some folks may have had to get jobs and may not be living the lifestyle they would have if they had access to their full resources
5475800 it is a fair expectation that somebody is going to apply for leave to appeal
5475801 its an issue of national importance which is the primary ground the supreme court of canada looks to
5475802 importance of the restructuring to the resolution of the abcp liquidity crisis and to the need to restore confidence in the financial system in canada

5475819 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5475820 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5475821 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5475822 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5475823 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5475824 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5475825 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5475826 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5475827 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5475828 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5475829 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5475830 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5475831 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5475832 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5475833 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5475834 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5475835 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5475836 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5475837 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5475838 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5475839 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5475840 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5475841 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5475842 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5475843 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5475844 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5475845 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5475846 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5475847 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5475848 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5475849 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5475850 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5475851 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5475852 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5475853 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5475854 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5475855 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5475856 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5475857 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5475858 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5475859 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5475860 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5475861 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5475862 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5475863 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5475864 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5475865 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5475866 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5475867 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5475868 the absolute priority must be our strategic security in the gulf
5475869 i think it said what it needed to say and to drag it on any further just waters down the message and the integrity of the characters i mean
5475870 ive researched the internet for evidence of an 11 under par round by any professional or amateur golfer the only ones i can find are those achieved by
5475871 i cant ever recall an amateur going so low under par
5475872 however i have been an avid golf follower only for the past 20 years or so can find no indication that any amateur has gone so low
5475873 there are course records of 60 even less but only on courses with ssss in the mid 60s
5475874 re amateur low rounds i have discovered that james score pf 61
5475875 for info this fall billy horschel will be starting his last year as a senior at florida university
5475876 they will then go to all of the trusted ca tm s and try to get them to issue them a valid oeinternal only certificate with the fqdn of a target sslvpn url as soon as they get a success that company now becomes their target of choice remember the certificate they need can be issued from any trusted ca in the browser and does not need to match the ca that the sslvpn gateway is using

5475885 we are very pleased to see the ruling bodies have carefully considered whether rules changes intended to address a perceived issue at tour events should be applied simultaneously to tour professionals elite amateurs and other golfers and ultimately opted to acknowledge those differences by separating their actions with respect to each group
5475886 how thick is the rulebook going to be in a few years
5475887 lets put it this way the document has been very well lawyered
5475888 foi a primeira vez que fiz fotos do g nero muito bom entrar em contato com a sensualidade atrav s da fotografia o jo o me ajudou bastante fiquei extremamente vontade no est dio e o resultado me surpreendeu muito
5475889 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5475890 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5475891 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5475892 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5475893 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5475894 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5475895 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5475896 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5475897 this is a planning took where all things are going
5475898 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5475899 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5475900 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5475901 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5475902 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5475903 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5475904 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5475905 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5475906 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5475907 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5475908 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5475909 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5475910 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5475911 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5475912 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5475913 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5475914 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5475915 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5475916 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5475917 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5475918 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5475919 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5475920 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5475921 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5475922 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5475923 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5475924 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5475925 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5475926 if you are the winning bidder we reserve the right to cancel this auction within the allotted time and will not be held liable for any such cancellation
5475927 here lift your leg no twist it come on stop moving

5475931 im gonna ice down as soon as i get to the hotel
5475932 i wear this band on my hand every day that says from robbins illinois
5475933 when i sat back and thought about it all the kids back in robbins and kids that never had the opportunity to really experience something like this in life i had to experience it so i can go back and tell them about it its the great wall

5475936 the urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of indigenous peoples which derive from their political economic and social structures and from their cultures spiritual traditions histories and philosophies especially their rights to their lands territories and resources
5475937 shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources particularly in connection with the development utilization or exploitation of mineral water or other resources
5475938 they are patrolling the streets and even the way they approach you theyre a little less arrogant
5475939 but if you ask me personally its a little too late
5475940 paul gross is an inspiring canadian and a leader in our industry
5475941 by paying tribute to our nations heroes including his own grandfather an alberta veteran gross uses the visceral charge of movies to contribute a foundation chapter to our national history while never ignoring the horrifying truths of this or any war passchendaele stands as truly epic storytelling from western canada
5475942 it just got a lot more interesting covering the jets this year
5475943 this is just a cynical marketing ploy by dell to sell more laptops
5475944 my what a lovely blog i think ill go out and buy me a couple of brand new dell laptops
5475945 this is the first study to comprehensively look at a large population of infected persons to study the long term effects of west nile virus
5475946 we found that both physical and mental functions as well as mood and fatigue seemed to return to normal in about one year
5475947 in adults there has been evidence that less than six hours of sleep a night was associated with high blood pressure levels
5475948 that was one of the more unique findings that poor sleep quality is associated with high blood pressure
5475949 to see how their blood pressure is developing over time
5475950 it does point to the direction that the next studies need to go to understand what less sleep and less efficient sleep mean in terms of blood pressure
5475951 distribute intellectual property free in order to sell services and relationships
5475952 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5475953 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5475954 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5475955 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5475956 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5475957 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5475958 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5475959 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5475960 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5475961 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5475962 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5475963 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5475964 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5475965 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5475966 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5475967 yo tell me what you want what you really really want
5475968 hey if youre not interested please let me know and ill try to get over you
5475969 all i know is that i would be reluctant to date someone who just got out of a relationship
5475970 no impeachment no chargesheet can stand against me nothing can be proved against me this much confidence i have but i think this is not the time for individual bravado this is the time for serious thought after reviewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies and on their advice i have decided to resign whatever i did was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5475971 banda number do amreeka ja kay ro wardi la kay dho
5475972 mukk gaya tera show your show is over go musharraf go
5475973 i may or may not be impeached but the country will lose in any case it will lose its dignity and credibility
5475974 taking active interest in building infrastructure strengthening teledensity of the country leaving behind a vibrant media and fighting for pakistan as a soldier in the army
5475975 main chahoonga ki aap meri baatein sune aur maane i want you to listen and believe what i am saying main fauji hoon i am a soldier i want to tell the nation that i have fought two wars for my country we have built museums art galleries and conserved our heritage pakistan was nowhere on the global map eight years ago i have engaged myself in political wrestling by reconciling with adverse elements in the interest of my country my efforts failed to straighten out these issues despite all this they want to impeach me why no charge can be proved against me nevertheless my ideology is still pakistan first sabsey pehley pakistan had i kept myself above my country i would have made some other announcement
5475976 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5475977 i think that would be a really fun match you would see a lot of great plays
5475978 therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance god is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent because he has fixed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness through a man whom he has appointed

5475988 i also told senator obama since there was one question where i was going to ask for a commitment it was the commitment later about would you allow a pepfar type presidents emergency plan for orphans and i thought if i was going to ask them for a public commitment i ought to let him know in advance i got to tell barack obama that in advance i did not get to tell john mccain that in advance it caught him by surprise im sure
5475989 well yes and lets be fair we called senator mccains office and they said that no we did not listen we did not know so what youre saying is part of that were just going to have to go on the honor system and we certainly respect that

5476051 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5476052 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5476053 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5476054 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5476055 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5476056 people think i appear on television to promote my image thats not fair i hate filming i turned down strictly come dancing but television is a wonderful opportunity to promote scientific ideas
5476057 i dont want to sound vindictive even though he mistreated me and my family i can ignore that but not the abrogation of the constitution incarceration of the judiciary we cannot let him go scot free we have to set a good precedent to pre empt such interventions
5476058 immediately after his musharrafs ouster the chairman of the senate will take over in 30 days we will elect a new person it can also be a woman we have agreed on a person of national consensus
5476059 no question i am not interested in being the headmaster of pakistans political school i aim at putting a parliamentary system into practice i have a passion to undo all the harm done by dictators
5476060 we drew plans to shake up his electoral college thats why we began by moving resolutions in the provincial assemblies he is shattered now totally it is the triumph of democracy i would be lying if i said i am not feeling relieved to see him go
5476061 whatever you may say but we joined hands for democracy in hindsight had all parties boycotted the elections in february we could have got rid of musharraf long ago but we failed to reach a consensus
5476062 america has traditionally supported dictators in the past they preach democracy but support dictatorships they now have to back a democratic system they have been our old ally and we understand their concerns but we should see eye to eye first
5476063 i hope that doesnt happen if it does it will be very serious i talk straight even india knows that
5476064 it has to done fully come my way or take the highway
5476065 it is obvious that us and europeans played a role in musharrafs exit now it is their responsibility as huge donors to pakistan army to support the civilian control of the armed forces this is absolutely necessary to guarantee for democracy in pakistan to survive
5476066 there appears to be a link between musharrafs decline and increase in activities on the indo pak border and terror activities inside india he has been made a fall guy by the army and his departure means losing a buffer between the political and the military establishment
5476067 the new civilian president will not carry any authority with the army even though he or she will be a member of the national security council so with a weak government in place be it on india or afghanistan or nuclear weapons general kayani will be the real ruler
5476068 the pakistan army will still maintain its role and it
5476069 prachanda is the supreme commander of both pla and the nepal army and both should be involved in the security set up

5476090 en el barco no ten a exigencias ni tel fonos ni visitas cuando me iba a la sala de proceso a escoger pescado o cuando me enrolaba en cualquier faena marinera era para sacar la mente de algun atolladero creacional para hacer actividad f sica como recomendaba agatha christie a los escritores para despejar neblinas y enfrentarme de nuevo al dilema ni antes ni despu s me fue posible el lujo de tanto tiempo para m mismo
5476091 el primero una especie de regresi n a lo m s primitivo del hombre ver al hombre en constante lucha contra el medio ambiente ser part cipe de esa lucha es algo inenarrable emotivo el otro es tener conciencia de lo que representa esa flota pesquera a miles de kil metros de nuestras costas pescando por el futuro
5476092 por otra parte aunque la canci n de silvio lleva el nombre del barco que sin duda cambi su vida a trav s de dicho nombre se establece una conexi n con uno de los episodios m s importantes de la revoluci n cubana playa gir n al que por un lado arropan las c lidas aguas del caribe y por el otro el verde de manglares y palmeras forma junto a playa larga la hist ricamente conocida bah a de cochinos es all a unos 200 kil metros al sureste de en pleno centro del estado de matanzas donde las tropas anticastristas de la brigada 2506 financiadas y entrenadas en guatemala por la cia desembarcaron en la madrugada del 17 de abril de 1961 comenzaba entonces uno de los acontecimientos m s determinantes de la guerra fr a y por supuesto de la mutua enemistad estados unidos cuba y viceversa el resultado de este evento supuso la primera derrota de estados unidos en el continente americano y un freno moral a sus ambiciones colonialistas en la repulsa al ataque murieron 157 guerreros cubanos en el otro bando 120 de los 1 500 invasores perecieron 72 horas despu s de iniciar la batalla el resto de los derrocados fueron apresados por el ej rcito rebelde en playa gir n meses m s tarde memoria trovada de una revoluci n

5476120 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5476121 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5476122 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5476123 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5476124 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5476125 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5476126 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5476127 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5476128 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

5476138 in the right direction however the vagueness of the provisions giving broad access to criminal intelligence to undefined agencies is very troubling
5476139 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5476140 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5476141 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5476142 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5476143 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5476144 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5476175 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
5476176 then jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up

5476189 we are not in a recession but we are feeling the effects of a brutal difficult crisis
5476190 the problem is that we have extremely limited room to manoeuvre because we have wasted quite a bit over the past year so maybe we should have the courage to put the fiscal package back on the table

5476224 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5476225 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5476226 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5476227 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5476228 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5476229 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5476230 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5476231 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5476232 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5476233 who are open to doing something on the production side
5476234 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5476235 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5476236 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5476237 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5476238 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5476239 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5476240 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5476241 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5476242 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5476243 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5476244 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5476245 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5476246 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5476247 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5476248 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5476249 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5476250 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5476251 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5476252 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5476253 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5476254 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5476255 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5476256 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5476257 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5476258 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5476259 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5476260 but back then i thought i might not get another chance to win a gold medal

5476262 we have recognised that compared to other teams our track and field team did not have great calibre so the pressure to perform was much larger we had liu xiang who always said his greatest opponent was himself and we say to our other athletes please do what you can
5476263 until saturday liu was in very good shape the injury intensified before his race he was in a lot of pain but was deter mined to compete obviously when he went into the stadium he went with the great est and strongest will
5476264 i saw liu shake because of the pain he would not have withdrawn unless the pain was intolerable
5476265 liu is still a young boy and he has been put under too much expectation

5476314 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5476315 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5476316 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5476317 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5476318 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5476319 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5476320 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5476321 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5476322 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5476323 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5476324 dhl has already committed to fund a triple digit million dollar amount on planned severance retention and health benefits for the work force in wilmington that includes abx astar and dhl employees and other u s locations
5476325 once that plan is established i plan at the appropriate time to travel to the u s to discuss how we can implement it in close cooperation and in open dialogue with local authorities and other stakeholders
5476326 i will be happy to keep you informed on progress
5476327 our point is the people need the jobs not the severance pay the benefit of a severance plan is to the company so people wont leave right away they want to keep the people there until the doors close
5476328 but at some point the health care and all that runs out what the heck are the people going to do
5476329 coach mac is great i absolutely love playing for him he is a players coach he makes you want to go out there and do you very best i think that hes very positive and very encouraging weve all enjoyed playing for him hes been a great addition to the coaching staff and to this offense
5476330 its still going to be a process up until the day i finish playing here im always going to keep working and try and better myself and try and understand the offense a little bit better every single time i look at coverage every single time i look at a protection im thinking in regards to the offense and ways that i can improve
5476331 i wouldnt say comfortable is the right word but what i would say is people are more adamant about doing the right thing people have been able to notice on the team that were a much much closer unit this year we spend a lot of time together outside the facility we expect great things from each other and we are going to hold each other accountable for those things i cant say were more comfortable we just know that the expectations are and were working our very hardest to meet those expectations
5476332 i think personal accountability weve brought in some great freshmen guys that you want to be around there is a lot of leadership stepping up both underclassmen and older guys i think coach saban has tried to establish those leaders and people are stepping up i think thats the biggest thing for this team this year thats different from last year people want to have the opportunity to lead this team i think thats going to pay dividends in the end
5476333 i think coach saban and the other coaches did a good job of establishing expectations for those guys we tried our very best to help prepare them during summer and tell them what its going to be like and i think the summer conditioning program really instilled that mental toughness and that approach that its going to be tough practice is going to be difficult you are going to have to study and work and have to do things off the field if youre going to make a difference on this team i think the freshmen have done a great job in knowing what they need to do to improve both mentally and physically
5476334 right now im trying to take every rep like its my last and trying to improve in any way possible in the run game pass game decision making accuracy and all kinds of things there are many areas of my game that i want to improve as time passes throughout the fall camp and the times running out to take as many reps as im going to get i want to make the best of those opportunities
5476335 a coup d etat was also staged on august 19 1971 by late dictator hugo banzer

5476339 what makes us possibly prouder of this medal than the athens one is that we had a big disappointment halfway through the event
5476340 that basically ruled out any possibility of winning the gold which is what we were hoping to achieve in fact it almost ruled out any medal so we are proud and relieved
5476341 that was the most intense race ive done for so long
5476342 we have sailed together for 11 years and we have also been at the front of a very competitive fleet

5476349 i saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story from the tip of every branch like a fat purple fig a wonderful future beckoned and winked one fig was a husband and a happy home and children and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor and another fig was ee gee the amazing editor and another fig was europe and africa and south america and another fig was constantin and socrates and attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions and another fig was an olympic lady crew champion and beyond and above these figs were many more figs i couldnt quite make out i saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree starving to death just because i couldnt make up my mind which of the figs i would choose i wanted each and every one of them but choosing one meant losing all the rest and as i sat there unable to decide the figs began to wrinkle and go black and one by one they plopped to the ground at my feet
5476350 after the natural disaster of hurricane katrina and the manmade explosion at the vampire summit everyone
5476351 when you fall in love with someone and youre just overdosing off of their love
5476352 you know i dont have a problem with her thats between her and lauren conrad
5476353 when i joined the cabinet for the first time i didnt speak ukrainian
5476354 but after working in the government for two or three months i simply began to speak in ukrainian
5476355 even if they russified the city no one ever russified the countryside even after 70 years of soviet rule when our grandmothers came to visit us in the city they all spoke ukrainian and we all understood them
5476356 it is very important for us women how we look that is an objective fact
5476357 if we are speaking about what is more important for a woman her work or her looks the answer is obvious
5476358 she will choose to look good above all else even at the cost of her work
5476359 you know how when a family breaks up in most instances the child stays with the mother she is the more reliable caretaker it is the same with a country i simply think that we are more reliable and we are more able to give up living a normal life in order honourably to fulfil our responsibilities
5476360 every man thinks he is more capable than any woman this is normal women dont criticise them for this in fact we support them in their sense of superiority
5476361 corruption has become the rule and the norm and practically the law
5476362 hate me they dont understand me because they cannot buy me or scare me
5476363 they fear ukraine as evidence that a post soviet country can quickly and effectively build a rule of law society and a democratic society
5476364 and this example is very very uncomfortable for those who would like to keep everything undemocratic and untransparent
5476365 today i see ukraines path perhaps not as swift as we would like perhaps not as rosy or as serene but unequivocally in the direction of the creation of a real european democratic rule of law state no one will succeed in plundering our national identity or humiliating us or god forbid destroying us for all the difficulties we face we are moving forward
5476366 thats the first thing i said to dids you better get a pr manager because its not him its not the bloke i know

5476371 hopes that the future president and the pakistan government can work together on developing and consolidating democracy in pakistan respecting the institutions and the rule of law
5476372 the european union will continue to support pakistan on this path
5476373 the reinforcement of pakistans democratic institutions will also consolidate stability and regional cooperation
5476374 well open tomorrow because we expect the weather will be nice
5476375 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5476376 after seeing what happened in new orleans and that area i think early evacuation of visitors is important for safety especially in the keys where we only have one road out lives are more important than revenue
5476377 this isnt the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs
5476378 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5476379 im doing good doing good just wishing i could have been out there last night
5476380 ill try to get treatment this week im feeling better every day
5476381 training camp is very physically demanding theres some things that come up whether it be a foot or an arm
5476382 its just trying to be smart trying to understand its a long season and not going out there and aggravating something
5476383 we continue to be adequately capitalized and we are committed to raising additional capital were financially sound and have strong liquidity
5476384 any capital that we do raise will depend on a variety of factors including prevailing market conditions
5476385 such things have no place in a nice family like ours so let us not talk about it

5476399 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age

5476403 seniors get paranoid about not having enough money so they cut back on the basics
5476404 its not a good thing for them to stay inside all the time
5476405 they need to go out eating out is a social activity for them
5476406 theyve lived through the depression and they are not willing to go back there again
5476407 when seniors families live a distance from their loved ones or when boomer children are busy trying to make ends meet themselves an older adult can get in trouble very quickly
5476408 thats why its so important that someone look out for the well being of seniors to ensure they are safe in their homes and eating properly taking their medications and able to maintain their appointments and social life
5476409 even if theyre financially ok they still get paranoid that their money wont last
5476410 they think it will be ok for a little while if i go without however its not the case because theyre older theyre already frail and one missed dosage could be very detrimental to their health
5476411 most of the time they just need someone to talk to
5476412 we had been learning from adult studies and adults that poor sleep or insufficient sleep has been linked to a number of a variety of health outcomes including coronary artery disease diabetes and even mortality
5476413 many of the children these days really are overscheduled they have numerous things that keep them up late at night like homework and activities that get them up in the morning like sports teams
5476414 thats why this study is problematic were not sure if sleep issues are a symptom of the factor causing blood pressure abnormality or if there is a direct association
5476415 it seems so long since i was enjoying the frenetic adrenalin pumping pit lane in a1gp and ive really missed it
5476416 im really looking forward to this season the new car will present a new challenge on a number of different levels there will be lots of new parts on the car and different procedures so itll be a learning curve for all of us but i think theres always more to learn so its one of the attractions of working in motor racing were heading off to some new venues this season so ill visit countries that i havent seen and ill enjoy that as well but above all this i just love going racing
5476417 for three years we have been saying that war is coming and the team has been working hard to deliver on this promise

5476428 evan and i believe in making the web a safer place for children and we are doing our part as industry professionals
5476429 we truly believe our message in the public service announcement it is not for appearances but we take it to heart certain sects of our society and our government have the adult industry under a microscope using it as a scapegoat for all things unholy we have a social responsibility to keep adult entertainment restricted to adults we are so honored to have been approached by asacp and to be included in such an important message stormy daniels is not only one of my peers but a friend and i am proud to stand alongside her in the name of something as important as the rta label if we dont police ourselves someone else will
5476430 we are thrilled that tera and evan have volunteered their time in order to remind other parents to do their part by utilizing parental filtering options
5476431 if the government does not listen to our demands the indigenous people are determined to continue until they are listened to

5476451 i want to update the house as i promised in july on the measures we are taking at home to root out terrorism and strengthen the resilience of communities to resist extremist influences following the incidents of 29 june and 30 june
5476452 in addition to the nine foreign nationals recently deported under immigration powers on grounds of national security a further 24 foreign nationals are currently subject to deportation proceedings on national security grounds
5476453 the prime minister spoke about the need to deport those who put our national security at risk does he agree that we have got to will the means as well as willing the end if he is advised that the human rights act gets in the way of deportation will he agree to its replacement
5476454 yet again the prime minister made a grand statement but proved himself unable to deliver further putting the security of this nation at risk
5476455 this is yet another failure by the government to keep its word on deporting terrorist suspects
5476456 it is also another massive strain on our security services to monitor these dangerous individuals

5476469 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5476470 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use
5476471 we continue to have great respect for creative teams and products and are hopeful that we can work together to reach a mutually agreed transaction
5476472 we think that take two management understands its lack of leverage particularly given the dearth of other bidders
5476473 if take two management remains realistic and negotiates a price below 27 50 we expect a deal to get done
5476474 and we all hold onto one another for dear life
5476475 weve been very good at going through the inventory at a good rate
5476476 im not sure i would call it a bias because that word has negative connotations but in general people do seem to have unconscious blind spots when it comes to the elderly
5476477 so not only ems staff but also those receiving patients at trauma centers are operating on subjective assumptions as to what elderly patients need how aggressively they should be treated and what hospitals can do for them rather than on clear and standard protocol codes and trauma recommendations
5476478 and as a result as patients get older they are less likely to get into a trauma center
5476479 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
5476480 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
5476481 randomized blinded placebo controlled clinical trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
5476482 i did give them documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5476483 one would have to assume that its going to be this week
5476484 this is an energy frontier we are just starting to explore
5476485 this is not a betting mans game but the potential is immense no question about that
5476486 on the few days you could see them from shore they would be about the size of your thumbnail
5476487 its a grand vision and technically it is feasible but nothing is solid
5476488 we are aware there are some folks noodling around on this but its not on our drawing boards
5476489 im not saying the technology wont be developed but deepwater is pretty speculative at this point
5476490 none of this is high tech it can be done

5476493 it is important that people with epilepsy and their caregivers take steps to prevent these tragedies
5476494 people with active epilepsy should shower instead of bathe take medication regularly to control seizures and should have direct supervision when swimming
5476495 in adults there has been evidence that less than six hours of sleep a night was associated with high blood pressure levels
5476496 that was one of the more unique findings that poor sleep quality is associated with high blood pressure
5476497 to see how their blood pressure is developing over time
5476498 it does point to the direction that the next studies need to go to understand what less sleep and less efficient sleep mean in terms of blood pressure
5476499 in conclusion we feel that the evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
5476500 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect

5476550 they intercept at many junctures in our lives and help wherever they can to make our lives run smoothly sometimes this is by inspiring a thought to spur us into action at others it is to lend us super human strength such as in the case of a woman being able to lift a car long enough to free her trapped child or we hear of a runaway truck with an unconscious driver at the wheel inexplicably swerving sharply at the last moment to avoid a bus stop queue of people in fact there are many instances which are often put down to luck coincidence or even a miracle but which have the touch of a hand of light behind it

5476561 we need to get over the hump and we need to do it quickly
5476562 theres still some lifting to be done and i suspect theres some donors that havent been asked and once they understand the majesty of this place hopefully we can close the cap and get on to complete the museum
5476563 people like governor ridge are really honored and played a modest role to push that funding and were going to get there theres no question of that
5476564 my commitment to everyone is these doors will open on march 20 so its my job to find it and were going to find it
5476565 how long do you think youll have to wait now
5476566 dont let it worry you just yet it could be a while
5476567 but i am worried i mean what if something happens to you
5476568 whats going to happen to me the worst that can happen is that they throw me straight back in here
5476569 well dont worry about me okay you need to be more worried about yourself once youre in here alone
5476570 youre listening to me right you know better than i do how dangerous some of the girls in here are theyll eat you alive given half the chance some of them literally
5476571 go wash your face and use the toilet if you need to
5476572 hey dont look at me like that fujimoto ive given you guys an extra three minutes out here with your buddies

5476581 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying position on the surge in iraq
5476582 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure this was back when supporting americas efforts entailed serious risk
5476583 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5476584 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded of 10 days ago by the events in the nation of georgia
5476585 are you going to set an agenda of change or one of compromise
5476586 youre feisty and i like that but youre wrong let me tell you why youre wrong
5476587 i intend to get things done as president and by the way i intend to win the presidency that means that yes sometimes were going to need to compromise to get things done theres nothing wrong with compromise as long as you understand what your core principles are
5476588 everybody making more than 2 5 million raise your hands
5476589 would be very good for people who are rich or healthy and never use health care
5476590 this is a particular concern when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama
5476591 let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts this position is a shortsighted approach that fails to recognize the benefits of space exploration and the technology and economic advantages that result from the space program

5476600 for many veterans the closest va facility isnt close enough
5476601 my reforms would not force anyone to go to a non va facility
5476602 they will not signal privatization of the va and they will not replace any scheduled expansion of the va network including those facilities designed to serve veterans living in rural and remote areas
5476603 if you determine on a case by case basis or based on geographical area that there is a need to do this for better access thats one thing giving it to everyone is another thing
5476604 here the veterans care access card will prove especially valuable affording women medical options while the va improves capacity and expands services
5476605 my va secretary must be a forceful advocate for veterans and forthright adviser to me so we can make the right choices about budgeting health care and other veterans benefit issues
5476606 he or she will also need to be a high energy leader too because well have a lot of work to do in improving service to veterans

5476625 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007
5476626 the figures may also be distorted by the possibility that women having children are at a relatively more senior classification already and simply have less scope for promotion
5476627 having a child brings a great opportunity cost to their career
5476628 i think it is certainly concerning that women are being discriminated against because of their family situation

5476663 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from

5476669 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
5476670 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from

5476672 city council is seeking greater clarity in the judgment the court determined that the covenant is not valid but does exist as a charitable trust

5476677 as i was passing a pickup truck in the other lane a dog riding in the back jumped out of the vehicle it was tied to the truck with a long length of chain
5476678 it was just awful i turned around to help the owners but the dog was covered in blood he was limp and lifeless when i got to them the owners were in shock one of them called 911 because the owners didnt know what else to do i gave them the number and directions for a local vet but i dont know what happened after that
5476679 this poor animal his chain was too long he had too much mobility in the back of the truck and he took advantage of it there are proper ways to secure a dog the best being having them ride inside the vehicle with a pet restraint or a secured crate if they are travelling in the back of a truck
5476680 for the most part people just dont realize how to secure their dog properly they think any length of chain or rope is fine because thats how theyve always done it i feel so bad for the family of this dog they were well meaning by using a chain to secure it they didnt mean for this happen they did have him restricted but it just wasnt enough
5476681 there is a fine of 109 under the motor vehicle act for failure to properly secure an animal while in transport but i dont think a lot of people know that
5476682 most of the calls we get about dogs in cars are to do with them trapped in vehicles on hot days people are starting to call in more and more about that because they are becoming familiar with the bylaw
5476683 its really motivated me to organize some educational clinics on pet safety in a blink of eye people can lose their pet if they dont know how to properly secure them id like to help make them aware of how to do that

5476729 why should one of these important events be orchestrated entirely by only one pastor who comes out of one narrow segment of our diverse country
5476730 a lot of people misjudged our motives and why we were trying to do this as a church and how we were doing it
5476731 afterward so many did say that this has the potential to change the climate of the election
5476732 it was good to have that kind of civil discourse with the candidates
5476733 it was a courageous step for rick warren that he stepped out and asked questions that represented us
5476734 he solidified for me what i thought he was about
5476735 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
5476736 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5476737 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
5476738 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
5476739 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

5477119 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5477120 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5477121 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5477122 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5477123 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5477124 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology

5477176 we have 14 per cent of global oil reserves putting us second only to saudi arabia
5477177 thats consistent with my own view of building strong competitive canadian companies
5477178 that the direction canada must go in is to be more open to foreign capital

5477243 i havent played but i will just wait and see and when the transfer window closes we will know then

5477249 if you imagine a chessboard on which the dark squares are shrubs and the light squares are grasses warming alone would tend to increase the size of the dark squares until the chess board is completely filled in
5477250 our experiment suggests that herbivores like caribou and muskoxen will slow this process inhibit it or perhaps even increase the size of the white squares on the chessboard
5477251 this discovery is quite surprising considering that muskoxen occur at such a low density at our site
5477252 careful management and conservation of existing populations of muskoxen and caribou as well as other large herbivores should be a priority in plans to mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystems
5477253 until now these animals seem to have been regarded more as background noise than as an active component of the ecosystems response to warming

5477255 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5477256 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5477257 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5477258 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5477259 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5477260 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology
5477261 there are many ways to kill a cell and weve discovered yet another one the bacterium hijacks activities from us and deregulates them its like a bulldozer

5477285 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5477286 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5477287 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5477288 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5477291 this study shows that number abilities are not simply based on culture or language associate professor reeve says
5477292 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5477293 we need to investigate ways in which we can add on to these building blocks to develop ways of teaching numeracy that are relevant to indigenous students culture he says
5477294 we also need to redefine the way we think about numeracy across the board moving away from the view that we need words to describe numbers and basic computations
5477295 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5477296 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5477297 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5477298 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5477299 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5477300 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5477301 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5477302 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5477303 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5477304 four of our crews were able to contain the blaze to the north eastern end of the building but they discovered that that part of the building actually housed people

5477311 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
5477312 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
5477313 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
5477314 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
5477315 it had always seemed to me having grown up watching carl lewis battle linford christie in the 100 meters that there was something unusual about the super muscular guys who followed burrell johnson greene were all fast but they seemed to muscle their way down the track and michael johnson looked like he had invented a new kind of running unnaturally technical all that changed this weekend usian bolt has changed the style of fast and he made it look easy it was one of those moments as much as i admire the other greats of the sport that i had to stop and think about what weve been seeing all these years it was somewhat reminiscent of how i looked at the final failure of mike tyson what kind of short heavywweight was he when he finally got boxed into the ground and what kind of sprinters are these who chased after bolt they all seemed to be too short and way too slow as soon as the real video is released to youtube and everybody else youll be seeing this one for a while
5477316 you can read the entire article here well this is good news i was pissed when they killed of f the character warrick brown played by gary dourdan thank goodness cbs had the decency to hire a real actor and not some rapper hiring rappers for acting gigs seem to be the rage in hollywood

5477318 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5477319 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5477324 the objectives were to provide product trial among a key physician group to accelerate uptake of vioxx as the second entrant in a highly competitive new class
5477325 i dont think people would be willing to risk side effects if they knew that the aim of a clinical trial was to boost profits for a pharmaceutical company
5477326 i would think that at some level this is standard practice

5477331 the idea of active ageing has slowly begun to take root and everywhere you hear people talking about it it means our work is sinking in
5477332 but active ageing is a process that starts when one is young and it is also about emotional spiritual financial and psychological well being
5477333 we were tasked with the job of not just taking over senior citizens week but to rebrand it and to relaunch and organise the active ageing festival within the first four or five months
5477334 among the many interest and non governmental groups already existing there were murmurings over who we were and what we could do for them

5477337 many people think the olympics are not as important to us as the world cup
5477338 but were brazil and every time we take to the pitch we do so to win we want to claim our countrys first gold medal in football
5477339 we have to play against everything we have to play to win theres no other way
5477340 if the opposition play open football against brazil then we can play open and pretty football

5477346 make no mistake ive met stefanie and shes a great person
5477347 ive a picture of stefanie in my office and i told tao li that if she misses a training session i would stick a pin in the picture
5477348 we were on the same bus from the games village to the beijing national aquatic centre on the first day and i really wanted a picture with him
5477349 but he looked so serious and so intense so i decided not to at the pool he was always very busy warming up and racing so there were no good chances to get one with him
5477350 how can that be im sure you would have gotten it if you asked
5477351 im now no 5 in the world in the 100m fly and really want to win a medal in 2012
5477352 i still need to improve im not the world no 1 yet i still need to work hard and not take it easy
5477353 youve to listen to yourself and know how much more you can do
5477354 it is a prestigious event and there will be a lot of stars there but we dont want people to get stuffy in their coats and ties
5477355 if we dont go on and move its going to continue to deteriorate so were at a crucial point
5477356 i see him as the precursor to martin luther king
5477357 not only was he an organizer he was a humanitarian an entrepreneur he was an author he took care of the poor he spoke for the disenfranchised he was the person who was recognized and well respected in both communities african american and the white communities
5477358 the waltons are concerned they dont want to infuse money into this project and then were not able to maintain it and thats a legitimate concern
5477359 the older ladies would teach us how to usher and wear our gloves
5477360 after the first three games we were written off and we fought back and we never deviated from what our plan was we didnt panic you got to stay in there and fight
5477361 we have really worked hard on strength we feel like especially up front were as strong as weve been in a long time
5477362 ahora tienes que darte cuenta de que tienes dos cosas
5477363 its the most normal thing in the world theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing
5477364 jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life
5477365 but people have different chemistry they have different lives its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out
5477366 youre either a cheater or you break up and im not the first im the second and thats it theres no lying theres no bulls t
5477367 i ended a relationship because there was no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time
5477368 i guarantee you theres 20 percent of the people on the street right now who are in a relationship they wish they could get out of but they dont know how and im going to be honest on the way in to my relationships and im going to be honest on the way out of my relationships
5477369 im sorry that the storys not interesting but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5477370 would be obliged to defend poland in case of an attack with greater speed than required under nato of which poland is a member
5477371 now we can move to circuit court and file our motions
5477372 theres nowhere she can go to be alone theres nowhere she can go to get peace
5477373 we feel shes well managed we havent heard about any outward threats by other prisoners we train our staff to treat all our prisoners equally
5477374 im so proud of the movie satine and i created together
5477375 shes one of my great loves and to share her beauty and talent with the rest of the world was a dream come true this is our night to celebrate

5477379 richard and i were having a laugh at the buzz surrounding us winning pedra branca and we just felt there wasnt actually any practical use for the tiny island
5477380 we thought it was funny but we didnt expect others much less the prime minister to find it funny too
5477381 theyre for prevention i dont want to go through the suffering of falling ill
5477382 theyre less aware that adults too require some types of vaccinations
5477383 for children compulsory immunisations have been put in place by the government but many adults dont see a need to get their vaccinations done because there is no legal requirement to do so most will get certain vaccinations done only if it is required by their employers or when they are travelling overseas
5477384 in fact most adults dont bother about their vaccinations until something is reported in the news or happens to their friends or family members
5477385 i regretted not finding out about the chickenpox vaccine earlier
5477386 if i had known about the vaccination i wouldnt have thought twice about spending a few hundred dollars to spare myself from the torture and hassle
5477387 unlike other diseases like measles and rubella adult chickenpox is still very common adult cases also tend to be more severe compared to childhood chickenpox
5477388 the elderly with chronic heart and lung diseases need the most protection because an infection like pneumonia can worsen their condition even a bout of flu can cause severe complications
5477389 certain vaccines are not as well taken up as they should be
5477390 its always good if we can prevent certain illnesses from occurring instead of looking at the costs why not take it as an insurance against the disease
5477391 i hated my job but am still angry about being let go
5477392 there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster and we have shown before we can come from behind
5477393 we lacked width and penetration its a handicap maybe and in the context of the season its not the result we wanted but with the changes we had to make you couldnt be too disappointed
5477394 i did not expect to lose a goal at a set piece to a header from a guy who is 5ft 8in
5477395 im a romantic i write poetry about cars i sing to them and talk to them just like a girlfriend i know whats in my heart and i have no desire to change
5477396 mark bailey 35 was taken to a crown court but after a brief hearing sent immediately to the magistrates court across the road police said bailey could not be walked across the street in handcuffs because it would breach his human rights so a van was scrambled from 60 miles away for the 30 second journey
5477397 brian binley conservative mp for northampton south said ive never heard such nonsense
5477398 i asked around for insurance and they just laughed at me no one offers insurance for paddling pools im always there to supervise but theyre trying to tell me i need lifeguards for a kiddies pool as well its crazy

5477415 rwanda may believe in economic ideologies but not when its own is at peril the country is putting in measures to deal with imported inflation by fighting competition policies through import restrictions though not a smart move it does appear that the countrys economic management team took one lesson in taxation realising that agriculture is the main stay of the economy rwanda has decided to make fertilizer importation easy as taxation rules have been relaxed consequently the growth in agriculture means a natural there is enough savings on food to invest in other areas of the economy such as industrial goods so an initial 6 8 growth set for the economy is now raised to 8 5 perhaps all african countries with a potential famine ought to emulate rwanda

5477624 so i said no now in interest of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so but i said no and ill never forget the high ranking officer who offered it slammed the door and the interrogator said go back to your cell its going to be very tough on you now and it was but it was not only the toughest decision i ever made but im most happy about that decision than any decision ive ever made in my life it took a lot of prayer it took a lot of prayer
5477625 i think that rich is should be defined by a home a good job and education and the ability to hand to our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one that we inherited
5477626 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5477627 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies thats my commitment thats my commitment to you
5477628 i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or a different view

5477632 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5477633 the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5477634 mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating obama campaign talking points
5477635 mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5477636 mitchell is repeating uncritically a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5477637 instead of trying to substantiate this blatant falsehood in any way andrea mitchell felt that she needed to repeat it on air to millions
5477638 cone of silence is a silly term i used from maxwell smart
5477639 we had him a green room in a totally different building
5477640 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
5477641 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
5477642 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that
5477643 it just seems inexplicable that this whole thing has been such an issue but clearly the mccain campaign wants this to be an issue wants to paint him as someone whos unfeeling about the troops
5477644 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5477645 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5477646 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5477647 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed

5477650 fuse has nothing to do with the content people produce with it
5477651 its just a motion tool that would be like blaming paint for an ugly painting there is nothing in fuse kit that can be exploited for malicious purposes all it handles is animation
5477652 it just sits there and then boom i think its a very serious issue i think the ad networks need to start taking a very close look at who their advertisers are
5477653 i felt good going into the final i had no reason to believe that i wasnt one of the people contending for gold i got on that line to win
5477654 at the end of the day im not upset its my second olympics im happy to be here i put my heart on the track and it wasnt a stellar time for me but i did well
5477655 i think my hope and prayer for them it that somewhere along the way they would learn to forgive
5477656 they will search for the blessing they missed in their home and perhaps never find it unless they get that first
5477657 the direction for the public is that this is not an either or decision
5477658 for a growing number of consumers its not that theyre saying the web is here im going to turn off the tv theyre going to add to their sources that may cut into their time there are only so many hours in the day but it doesnt mean eschewing the traditional sources of news
5477659 the established news brands will continue to be the brands that attract the publics attention
5477660 i would say theres a direct correlation between how long someones been in the business and that persons willingness to adapt
5477661 this means people really want our information we just have to keep up with how they want it it means they cant be platform centric the way they used to be for people to think the audience desire for news is going away this flies right in the face of that
5477662 its a terrific time for journalists to take their career into their own hands its always been a very passive career you move up from market to market and you dont have to retrain yourself but if you take the time to retrain if you learn the new skills and its not a matter of new skills for journalism those rules stay the same you throw yourself to the front of the pack

5477665 it is a wise and prudent move the market is going through a period of uncertainty now but the chances of the market picking up in the next four years is quite high

5477674 we didnt talk about the fact weve won the last seven times against them but we wouldnt mind playing them every week at the moment
5477675 if we can stay healthy and we keep our composure i cant see why we cant be

5477685 how do you expect a girl participating in her first olympics to win without last minute coaching support at least fellow player and experienced sharath kamal 2006 melbourne commonwealth games double gold medallist could have given her better tips than choudhary who is the technical committee chairman of the ttfi
5477686 whats wrong in having a manager on the coachs bench
5477687 there are more important things we have a long term programme to groom paddlers for the 2010 commonwealth games and he is accompanying them to north korea
5477688 its very important for us to defend our commonwealth gold during the 2010 delhi games and also to do well during the olympics yefremov will be training and travelling with our best players like sharath kamal and subhajit saha
5477689 he is the most decorated technical official in the country but i doubt his credentials as coach
5477690 its a war being fought with paintballs not with live rounds

5477697 she is fully integrated into the sports school she speaks with a singapore accent and she wants to speak in english even when i converse with her in mandarin
5477698 i like her champions mindset when she lost the asian record in the 100m fly to chinas zhou yafei she was angry and she went out and posted the 57 54 sec record in the semi final she knows she has grown and developed in this system and we want to go on this track
5477699 we need to figure out what is needed to give tao li that competitive level so that she can be pushed to excel even more
5477700 we need to find out where she can go to find top level competition
5477701 its the same for table tennis they played all over the world to get great exposure we must let them have access to that level of competition
5477702 we need to grow them as well weve got to figure out a system in singapore for the athletes to make a living and to integrate with the countrys culture
5477703 with the systemic build up of a continuous pipeline of performance and delivery the confidence in winning medals in 2012 and 2016 and beyond is high
5477704 im confident we wont have to wait so long for a medal again

5477709 it looks like they searched the entire store and they could not find the turtle
5477710 i guess this qualifies as a missing turtle report but i dont think were out there looking for it
5477711 in the wild they would have zero chance in captivity most die within a few days of birth
5477712 they were trying the best they could but the turtle was just starting to waste away it wasn t feeding properly
5477713 they dont have the ability to dive and swim the way a normal turtle will if they are put into deep water they will actually drown
5477714 they will flip themselves over and they can t right themselves because one head is going one way while the other head is going the other way

5477719 theres no connection i imagine people have drawn crosses in the dirt before after and since
5477720 who controls the past controls the future who controls the present controls the past
5477721 you have not controlled it that is what has brought you here you are here because you have failed in humility in self discipline you would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity you preferred to be a lunatic a minority of one only the disciplined mind can see reality winston you believe that reality is something objective external existing in its own right you also believe that the nature of reality is self evident when you delude yourself into thinking that you see something you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you but i tell you winston that reality is not external reality exists in the human mind and nowhere else not in the individual mind which can make mistakes and in any case soon perishes only in the mind of the party which is collective and immortal whatever the party holds to be truth is truth it is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the party that is the fact you have to relearn winston it needs an act of self destruction an effort of the will you must humble yourself before you can become sane

5477737 after the martyrdom of my mother i said that democracy was the best revenge and today it was proved true
5477738 on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah
5477739 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5477740 this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands in tax breaks for people earning 2 5 million because theyre only middle class
5477741 everyone making 2 5 million or more raise your hands
5477742 i think if youre just talking about income how about five million
5477743 the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
5477744 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5477745 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5477746 this guy obviously does not pump his own gas he obviously does not do his own shopping he obviously does not pay his own bills

5477771 sergeant max allison of the seattle police crime laboratory declared that all of the damage reports were composed of
5477772 the seattle pitting incident contains many key factors that play a part in collective delusion these include ambiguity the spread of rumors and false but plausible beliefs mass media influence recent geo political events and the reinforcement of false beliefs by authority figures in this case the police military and political figures
5477773 this combination of factors added to the simple fact that for the first time people actually looked

5477810 la gente se desarrolla y va entendiendo lo importante que es la comunicaci n para el desarrollo de un pa s en el discurso el gobierno entrega toda su voluntad para las radios comunitarias seamos las defensoras del proceso de transformaci n pero en la pr ctica es otra cosa en definitiva no nos han dado el apoyo que nosotros esper bamos y por ende a estas alturas nos hemos visto en la obligaci n de ejercer nuestro derecho y hacemos cr tica en el marco de un sistema que propende a escuchar y a cambiar al momento de la exigencia comunal nosotros creemos que debe revisarse el reglamento de radiodifusi n y televisi n comunitaria de verdad nos tiene my limitados en crecimiento en desarrollo y cobertura en una reuni n con el presidente en el sector la cuchilla por una intervenci n de los amigos de la radio guacaubana se inici ese debate nosotros creemos que debe revisarse muy bien su contenido y mejorarse o definitivamente eliminarse pero que la discusi n surgiera desde barquisimeto porque nosotros tenemos un estudio integral de ese punto espec fico de all que nosotros creemos que esa es una de las patas cojas de este cuento creemos que nosotros tenemos que hacer un llamado contundente a conatel para que se retomen los debates y se revisen los postulados de ella ley de telecomunicaciones y modificarlo para que en definitiva las radios comunitarias tengan el desarrollo y el crecimiento que se espera porque sino las radios comerciales van a seguir teniendo la preferencia de cobertura y acci n toda vez que la ley no les pone esta camisa de fuerza para nadie es un secreto que desde las mismas instituciones p blicas se toman como referencias las coberturas de las radios para los efectos de penetraci n y pauta promocional lo que imposibilita o pone en minusval a las radios comunitarias frente a esta tendencia comunicacional igual sucede con mucha gente por eso nosotros pedimos que sea reconocido el esfuerzo de los aportes que todas las radios comunitarias vienen haciendo en el estado porque la evoluci n comunicacional no solamente debe ser vista como un evento tecnol gico de penetraci n o alcance sino tambi n en el aspecto socio pol tico pues en ellas se da forma in ditamente a las primeras aristas de la comunicaci n horizontal y no vertical de la comunicaci n libre y no interesada a esos n cleos radiales que adem s de elaborar mensajes para transmitirlos por sus ondas tambi n participan activamente en los procesos de sus barriadas que sirven de orientadores sociales y de apoyo solidario a quienes se organizan para abrirse espacio en la lucha comunal no solo emitimos un mensaje sino que dinamizamos culturalmente la comunidad
5477811 en medios comerciales el estado invierte un promedio de 97 de su presupuesto mientras que para los medios comunitarios solo se invierte el porcentaje restante a nivel nacional sino son medios favoritos y en ese sentido hemos debatido tambi n pues hay que observar y determinar muy bien cual va a ser el modelo que queremos como sociedad humanista emergente
5477812 por qu las instituciones no observan como n cleos de organizaci n comunitaria leg timos a las radios comunitarias ignorando casi deportivamente los proyectos que se presentan porqu consejos comunales no toman en cuenta sus propuestas y por qu el estado piensa que el apoyo a estos n cleos comunicacionales es solamente la pauta cuando en realidad son entes din micos donde se trabaja en muchos flancos simult neos el educativo el cultural el organizativo cuenta indira que desde hace meses ya esperan por la aprobaci n o al menos una respuesta por parte de concultura de un proyecto de orientaci n radial generado pro as comunidades que hacen vida en la radio y hasta ahora solo han recibido peloteos e indiferencia
5477813 para nosotros es una tremenda victoria que nosotros acompa emos a los nuevos comunicadores y a la organizaci n comunitaria en sus intentos por lograr la transferencia de poder a la gente en su empe o por hacer de sus estructuras de base entres controladores para garantizar la soluci n de su problemas y creemos que estamos d ndole una batalla importante al tiempo pues es verdad que han pasado muchas cosas en muy poco tiempo han cambiado muchas y se han abierto puerta importantes pero tenemos muchos a os de retraso y en base a eso es que nosotros trabajamos con le preocupaci n generacional de que ya estamos retrasados en lo que hacemos y lo tanto que nos falta por andar hay que apresurar la marcha y hacerla indetenible cuando a mi me comentan que porque cumplimos en m s de la cuenta con las cuotas de m sica tradicional exigidas por conatel yo les digo a los usuarios que me consultan que la raz n es esa precisamente hemos tenido muchos a os de retraso y estamos ganando tiempo al tiempo
5477814 tenemos que establecer mecanismos de negociaci n que nos permitan avanzar en la discusi n de la contrataci n colectiva

5477820 din punctul meu de vedere tipul acesta de declara ii este inacceptabil i nu reprezint punctul de vedere al pnl
5477821 americans put an emphasis on individualism rather than on cooperation
5477822 there was an attempt to impose a charge based on users but it would have been an administrative nightmare for brokerages to collect just a few dollars per account
5477823 much of the time consuming negotiations had centred on securing a waiver of end user charges which might otherwise have cost online investors and traders some money every month
5477824 as the broking houses will be absorbing all of these financial costs there will be no cost impact on tens of thousands of retail investors

5477833 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5477834 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5477835 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5477836 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5477837 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5477838 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5477839 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5477840 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5477841 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5477866 israel has to take whatever steps it feels necessary to protect itself against someone who has openly said it would seek to annihilate her
5477867 specifically the type of aircraft israel needs for its defense purposes
5477868 it is possible for different cultures and people to live together but it is not necessarily very realistic to expect two governments to operate on the same street
5477869 if a person comes here and can see the close proximity just the tiny little footprint that israel actually occupies one gets the idea that to maintain a long term security and peace there has to be attention to every inch of real estate
5477870 he understands dealing with the arab world terrorism hamas fatah cannot be that oslo agreement has failed land for peace doesnt work and that you cant divide jerusalem and expect everything is going to be okay
5477871 i think the first two pictures took those ideas of inescapable destiny and dread so seriously we wanted to make sure we did that as well
5477872 i gave all the actors the road to read to get their heads right bout this sort of existential detachment that living in a post apocalyptic world would bring
5477873 were in a very large post apocalyptic environment the bombs have gone off and theres very little left people are wandering through lonely landscapes we want to capture that by way of david lean photographic expanses so you think youre looking at lawrence of arabia so far so good

5477877 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5477878 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food

5477882 ahora yiwu ha devenido en la mayor base de producci n de joyas de la parte continental por lo que los precios de yiwu determinan los precios al por menor de mi negocio
5477883 desde fines de la d cada de 1970 momento en que comenz a aplicarse la pol tica de reforma y apertura el gobierno municipal de yiwu ha llevado activamente a la pr ctica la estrategia de desarrollar la ciudad mediante el fomento del comercio y la promoci n de un desarrollo socioecon mico r pido y multifac tico regulado por el mercado hace 20 a os los yiwuneses empezamos a hacer pruebas para convertir nuestra ciudad en uno de los principales centros nacionales de peque os productos en china esas iniciativas experimentales desempe aron un papel decisivo en el despegue econ mico de yiwu cuya situaci n geogr fica es ciertamente ventajosa adem s de encontrarse en el centro de la provincia de zhejiang est rodeada de ciudades que son importantes centros de las industrias ligera y textil decididos a aprovechar esa ventaja en 1982 los habitantes de yiwu organizamos la feria nacional de peque os productos la primera y la mayor de su g nero en la china de aquel entonces poco a poco el comercio de peque os productos fue convirti ndose en el pilar de la econom a local y en el emblema del municipio de yiwu
5477884 la mayor a de nuestros productos se exportan principalmente a los pa ses rabes los ee uu y am rica latina la verdad es que la venta minorista a los comerciantes nacionales es muy reducida la raz n es muy simple la venta de l mparas decorativas en los mercados extranjeros reporta ganancias decenas de veces superiores a las que obtenemos vendi ndolas en el interior de china no puedo darle datos sobre nuestras exportaciones ya que es un secreto comercial pero s puedo asegurarle que son muy elevadas y rentables
5477885 en solo un mes exportamos veinte o treinta contenedores de zapatos casi todos se exportan a oriente medio y frica con la venta de un par de zapatos las ganancias brutas son muy reducidas en cambio los contratos de venta al por mayor que firmamos con los empresarios extranjeros ascienden a decenas de miles yuanes

5477889 it is over 3 weeks since we learned that the portuguese authorities had ended judicial secrecy
5477890 whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a 9 month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
5477891 please accept my personal apologies and pass them along to everyone you meet who was inconvenienced
5477892 the iab cant prevent anyone from hitting a ball they can only ban a formal league festivus was not a formal league but a show haim katz had already said his group can regulate that

5477894 sustained winds could get as high as 40 to 50 miles an hour
5477895 to put it in perspective we get severe thunderstorm warnings with winds 58 miles an hour or higher
5477896 winds will pick up as fay moves through an area people will feel it
5477897 some parents cant get off work at the last minute
5477898 this is basically to get all of our crews ready to get them out in the field to make the preparedness steps so we can keep the public safe

5477901 life in prison is too good for him this is one of the most outrageous events ive seen in a long time
5477902 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5477903 see look it can be gray and rainy and cool here too
5477904 if the plan is accepted by the palestinians it will kill the palestinian dream to establish an independent state
5477905 this plan is impossible and there is no way that we can accept it
5477906 the plan is completely rejected not only would it not prepare the ground for an everlasting peace between israel and the palestinians but it would give rise to a permanent atmosphere of escalating tension
5477907 what the georgian authorities have done is beyond human understanding it cannot be justified or allowed to go unpunished
5477908 we will see to it that this crime does not go unpunished
5477909 our armed forces have overcome the crisis of the 1990s are battle worthy and can perform any peacekeeping mission
5477910 there is reason to believe that wal mart stores inc has made prohibited corporate expenditures by expressly advocating against senator obamas election to employees
5477911 the phenomenon of thousands of people moving together in huge blocks like a machine operated by one person to serve one purpose is a phenomenon that history has proven to be associated with regimes we would rather forget ever existed
5477912 opposite the giant stages speer positioned huge blocks of people dressed in brown and black uniforms who together formed an impressive geometric shape the spirit of the generation which was disturbed by the anarchy and disorder couldnt but watch the scene in great awe
5477913 the visitors in nuremberg including many foreigners were so impressed they were ready to disregard the repulsive aspects of the regime
5477914 if this was about a small country like andorra then that wouldnt have been a reason for concern but this is china a country that accounts for a fifth of the worlds population and has enormous power and natural resources it has the ability to bring into action the ideas that lie behind those ceremonies ideas of imperialism intervention and oppression
5477915 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we do
5477916 we know what messages will work and what will not
5477917 the worsening economic outlook suggests that oil prices have further to fall but opec whose members are due to meet in early september may act to prevent them from falling too far
5477918 there is a danger though that the organization will over react cut its production too sharply and send oil prices back up
5477919 the cges believes that opec member countries facing increased government spending and rising inflation will not be happy to see prices fall far below 100 dollars per barrel
5477920 if we had the territorial integrity of serbia in the case of kosovo then we would have the territorial integrity of georgia with regard to south ossetia and abkhazia
5477921 takes away the right to criticise russia for any present or future action
5477922 i dont think you can control all the world from one center what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5477923 you dont need to be buying alcohol after 10 anyway
5477924 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit
5477925 but it was really cool and she was happy when she got to the hospital we all thought it was going to be an all day thing and instead the baby just sort of popped out ok were happy now
5477926 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
5477927 im writing every day right here at the piano in this living room
5477928 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing its harvey mason of the underdogs
5477929 id love to if i can find the right movie
5477930 actually i have a part that just came up were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
5477931 i would hope it stands until the end of the year and then well sit back and evaluate where we are at that time where britney is at that time
5477932 it is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
5477933 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something good
5477934 if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys
5477935 britney and kevin wanted to settle the trial that was coming up was for permanent custody it made no sense for that trial to proceed so we worked out an agreement the agreement says that on oct 1 well probably get another overnight and that will stay in place until the end of the year or the end of the conservatorship
5477936 nam cum habeat eorum sententia nihil esse praeter individuum roscelin de gener
5477937 the waves were tricky out there and i just looked for better potential ones
5477938 it kind of came my way then i tried to get a couple of big airs and completed them so it gave me some big scores
5477939 i had a good result in japan and it boosted my confidence pretty good
5477940 this event is a prime one and there are many points to grab so i hope i can get things going well tomorrow
5477941 i was a bit stressed before that heat but once in the water i just let go
5477942 i was feeling comfortable and the waves were fun so i just pushed my turns really hard i have been surfing some really good boards that bring me enough speed so i am trying to get airs and radical manuevers
5477943 i really want to make as far as possible here
5477944 when you compete at home you just feel relaxed and you get boosted by the public and cheerings it really makes a big difference
5477945 i was kind of shaky before that heat because i really want to do good here
5477946 i have had several good results here and i wanted to get through that one clint kimmins and shaun burrell are excellent surfers and it was not an easy one
5477947 it has been good this year but i just need to get more consistency
5477948 it is tough to travel all year and remain in top form at every event you go but you have to step up and keep the flow i hope i can have a good one in that 6 star prime
5477949 its a very good range of measures that offer support in a lot of ways
5477950 i dont know whether this will be effective inactually getting people to have more children because so much of this is a personal decision but it does make the whole environment more baby friendly
5477951 its true that women have the better touch with children but the situation today is different and men can make the effort
5477952 try to influence them to have the right expectations and share the responsibility
5477953 we are a very traditional society where the mother is supposed to nurture the child so i think it will take some time to see real change
5477954 what it meant was less takings as a lawyer less work but she decided that children were more important to her
5477955 i think you have to maintain a balanced fulfilling life and you have to keep a pace which is sustainable not just for one two years but for a lifetime
5477956 some pressure is inevitable but give them space to grow up
5477957 first of all and encouragingly many singles want to get married
5477958 they are not happy to be single they want to get married they are serious
5477959 one young lady stood up and she explained her problem that she regretted
5477960 she started off putting her career first after she got her career sorted out she started thinking about looking for a partner she signed up at dating agencies tried no joy
5477961 he said that is me i work in slippers so i come in slippers
5477962 and i thought to myself wow i was lucky when i was invited to meet my girlfriends parents i didnt bring a present either
5477963 you might be carried away by romantic images in the movies boy meets girl boy falls in love with girlinstantly madly married lives happily ever after maybe have twin babies
5477964 but we are ordinary people in real life we may not have instant sparks the first time but you take your time discover the person for who he or she is nurture the relationship and then love may blossom
5477965 the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies
5477966 creatng a business model is a lot like writing a new story
5477967 it turns me on when you kiss my neck darling
5477968 i cant wait until i feel your big hard amp inside my
5477969 that was so intense so fun and i learned so much but how am i ever going find the energy to do it again
5477970 why does it have to be by a graphic designer
5477971 this class should be about reading the most useful ideas by the best writers whoever they are
5477972 visions and ghosts came down and the shakers chiefly women and young girls made gift drawings the drawings were gifts from above not gifts to another
5477973 that was then and this is now but what is next
5477974 the urban landscape from the point of view of images
5477975 this is not just a violation of the peace agreement but also a challenge to the overall aspirations of the people for peace and progress in the island of mindanao
5477976 drive to the temple of divine heavenly holiness look for a rock shaped like a squatting dog then drive 478 paces north there you will find an old man in a green hat tell this man the weasel burps at dawn then
5477977 it is so cool i just tried to prove it to myself
5477978 and one of the questions this crisis raises is who do you want sitting across the table from vladimir putin and people like him john mccain or senator obama
5477979 as you saw with the surge and as you see even before this crisis broke out he said last year weve got a problem we should be thinking about having russia be disinvited from the g 8
5477980 if we were georgians and the russians were invading our country and killing our people wed be in a state of war and clearly thats not what we want and john sometimes hes a good person but
5477981 i think barack obama has consistently demonstrated superior judgment to senator mccain on a whole host of national security issues
5477982 whether to go into iraq or not barack obama was correct how to get out of iraq the iraqis embrace barack obamas position even george bush is coming around
5477983 he was right about afghanistan finally john mccain is coming around on that he was right about engaging iran george bush has come around on that and he was right about georgia months ago he was calling for this conflict to be diffused instead the president and john mccain are so obsessed with iraq we dropped the ball if wed listened to senator obama and his judgment perhaps we wouldnt be here today
5477984 barack obama has consistently demonstrated the kind of judgment that we want in a commander in chief
5477985 hes strong hes cool hes smart thats what we need in these difficult times

5478042 absent any further appeals we expect the restructuring to close by sept 30 2008
5478043 i was extremely relieved to hear that the ontario court of appeal not only dismissed the appeal but did so in a unanimous way
5478044 i think were done here and should be moving forward

5478059 weve got all sorts of attacking options and its nice to see it hasnt been in the past but this is a team with a bit of flair something a lot of canadian soccer fans havent seen very much over the last 18 months or so this team has come together as a good group good cohesive unit im really looking forward to see how we can do in this round of qualifying
5478060 i think you can look at that and analyze it and say well the last time it probably took the better part of nine or 10 points to get there
5478061 maybe its going to be the same this time but you dont know theres 18 points on the table youve got to have your team ready to get three in every match were only looking at getting three on wednesday and then go from there
5478062 i think the team has improved a lot in the last year
5478063 theyve got good athletes and theyve got players playing on a good level now i expect a difficult match on wednesday
5478064 theyve got some fast athletes we know that and some of them will be playing for them on wednesday

5478070 for me there was something nostalgically playful about the music i just kept envisioning a late 1960 s variety show sort of a homage to ed sullivan and the american bandstand idea of a televised performance it was meant to be a bit campy and over the top and i knew if anybody could pull it off lady antebellum would do so in grand fashion not only did they dominate they took the video to a level of wit and charm that blew me away they are so cool so fun and so happy to be doing what they do

5478075 both candidates agreed to the format of two consecutive interviews
5478076 agreed to and understood that in order to maintain a level playing field sen mccain wouldnt see or hear any of sen obamas appearance
5478077 like there will be a tax question there will be an environment question he did not give them specific wording except on two questions and he did that because this forum was new ground and he didnt want them to be nervous he wanted them to be comfortable
5478078 so it was a level playing field except obama had the extra intel of that question

5478103 parliament wisely avoided attempting to anticipate the myriad of business deals that could evolve from the fertile and creative minds of negotiators restructuring their financial affairs
5478104 it left the shape and details of those deals to be worked out within the framework of the comprehensive and flexible concepts of a compromise and arrangement i see no reason why a release in favour of a third party negotiated as part of a package between a debtor and creditor and reasonably relating to the proposed restructuring cannot fall within that framework
5478105 while the notion of releases in favour of third parties including leading canadian financial institutions that extend to claims of fraud is distasteful there is no legal impediment to the inclusion of a release for claims based in fraud in a plan of compromise or arrangement
5478106 an interpretation of the ccaa that recognizes its broader socio economic purposes and objects is apt in this case
5478107 here the debtor corporations being restructured represent the issuers of more than 32 billion in non bank sponsored abcp notes

5478115 the mongol rally is a genuinely dangerous thing to do the website is written in a lighthearted fashion but you cannot underestimate the risks involved in undertaking this kind of journey teams really have been chased by heavily armed bandits and got stuck in the wilderness hundreds of miles from rescue temperatures can soar above 50 degrees centigrade which will kill you very quickly and there will often be no medical facilities you really are on your own if it all goes wrong thats it tough in short do not undertake the rally lightly all the above taken into account it is incredible fun you just need to be aware that it is not like driving in europe but longer

5478123 we remain suspended for the moment in afghanistan out of respect for the victims of this horrible crime
5478124 the change is that we suspended operations and we are looking at all of our processes
5478125 were looking at if and how we can continue working there to safeguard our international and national staff
5478126 we are surely committed to the afghan people as were jacqui nicole shirley and mohammad the four individuals that were killed
5478127 the young canadian women that were killed they were there to assist afghan kids go to school there are more young afghan kids in school including girls than ever before as result of this kind of humanitarian assistance
5478128 over the years weve worked there weve had various levels of insecurity to deal with and weve adjusted our operations accordingly
5478129 the area in which we work has been one of the safer areas although we have seen an increase in insecurity
5478130 in most environments where we work there are markings on our vehicles in afghanistan we dont use them anymore for obvious reasons
5478131 but what we do in situations like that or even as a result of what happened more recently we reassess our operations and security
5478132 but we are committed to stay on the ground and continue the work that we are doing but to ensure that we do it in as safe as possible means
5478133 were not going to respond to threats and certainly it will have no effect on canadian policy
5478134 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5478135 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the transatlantic structures
5478136 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5478137 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5478138 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast

5478174 we were hoping the captured fisheries sub sector including commercial and municipal fisheries to post the biggest gains in the first half but it didnt happen
5478175 because it is already the lean season for captured fisheries a lot of municipal and commercial fishermen are slowing down their operations which is understandable with lesser fish to catch and the high fuel prices any prudent businessman would naturally scale down operations
5478176 we can offset the losses from the captured fisheries through aquaculture

5478218 yes hellgate is not a big success that sucks and its depressing
5478219 the reason that work is depressing right now is that people are leaving in droves theyre leaving weve had programmers accountants hr people and artists leave the founders are all still around but theyve been floating away from hellgate to work on various other projects
5478220 thing is the way things are going im likely to be the only programmer still working on hellgate left from the original crew
5478221 ive heard rumors that other programmers and artists are thinking of leaving
5478222 when i wrote that blog post i was frustrated and just a little bit overwhelmed but it was nothing that a mug of hot chocolate a few hours of gaming and a good nights sleep didnt cure
5478223 i was surprised and disappointed at the communitys response to my words which were more directed at my family and friends to describe my state of mind at the time than to give any sort of insight into the company
5478224 sorry to have caused such a ruckus over such a small thing
5478225 everyone has good days and bad days guy was having a bad day

5478241 due to significant api changes in the upstream open source project and due to the timeline of getting certain bluetooth profile implementations certified a comprehensive bluetooth api will not be possible or present in android 1 0
5478242 due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from outside the device the data messaging facility of the gtalkservice will not be present in android 1 0
5478243 we know that these changes will affect many developers who have worked with the prior early looks at the sdk and we are very sorry for the resulting inconvenience
5478244 we look forward to the possibility of restoring some or all of this functionality in a later version of the android platform
5478245 i did give them documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned

5478248 the only problem i have with canada is that they
5478249 im sorry but i cant sit on that hard wooden seat
5478250 for me the biggest issue is getting the book to the reader and how thats done im happy to leave to the marketing people unless they overstep the mark in this case i feel they really have overstepped the mark
5478251 if they had asked writers and children and parents they would have realised a lot of people are outraged at the prescriptive nature of this scheme
5478252 theres no such thing as an average seven year old they could be four or 10 or like me 65 its just nonsense
5478253 if you say a book is for a seven year old the nine year old is going to be trying to cover it up at the back of the class
5478254 there are so many more important issues they should concentrate on
5478255 the best way to get children to read is to write good books in the first place make sure theyre beautifully illustrated then have libraries open and teachers who love books and parents who love books thats how we improve reading among children
5478256 the interesting thing about childrens books is that its not the readers who are buying them it is parents and grandparents and libraries and schools
5478257 i think thats what the publishers were trying to address as a reader you drop a book if you dont like it so children will self censor but its knowing what to buy them in the first place
5478258 at that time it felt like there were a lot of vietnam films and war movies being made
5478259 as an actor i was going in on them or had friends who were doing them and going off to these fake boot camps
5478260 a few years went by and my friend justin theroux and i were talking about it

5478262 theres nothing like the devotion and the constant appreciation that you get from a dog

5478276 the vice president is not an independent voice but merely echoes the position of the president
5478277 well when you talk about a guy whos broken every record possible that any qb dreams of achieving whos been the face of the league and green bay i think its shown for guys playing the position now that it can happen to anybody
5478278 no matter what your accomplishments are the records youve broken etc when a team is ready to move in a direction theyre ready so i guess brett will continue on by any means necessary which means being with another team
5478279 all i can tell you is that hes had a great offseason his camp has been phenomenal and that the goal is always the same with us were shooting for the stars every year were after a championship hes here and were ready
5478280 i can tell you i have very high expectations for us this season and a lot of that has to do with donovan
5478281 hes looked as good as ive ever seen him in training camp he knows what it takes theres always pressure on the quarterback as the leader of this team donovan knows he has to do well in order for us to do well and when hes healthy i believe hes the best qb in football
5478282 the way donovans mind is right now im not knocking him
5478283 hes locked in right now i havent seen him this focused in years hes ready
5478284 none of us are safe i feel the same way donovan does i cant speak to whether the whole favre scenario added to donovans focus knowing him hed probably say it didnt but i certainly believe it did to watch what happened to brett favre has to be a wakeup call for anyone in the nfl but especially a quarterback of donovans stature
5478285 ive said it a thousand times everybody cant play in philadelphia there has to be something about you to be able to survive here and the cats who can may not want to
5478286 hes still a guy who swears he wants to win for this city
5478287 this is not the time for individual bravado this is the time for serious reflection whether i win or lose the nation will lose in every way it will be a blow to the dignity of the nation and to the office of the president
5478288 therefore after consultations with all my advisers and friends for the sake of the country i announce my decision to step down from the office of president
5478289 god forbid the army should not have to interfere i would never want that
5478290 i leave my fate in the hands of the people of pakistan i am human so i may have made mistakes but my intentions were always honest and im sure the people will excuse me
5478291 he should answer in a court of law for the crimes he has committed against the people of pakistan we feel that all that should be brought out in an open public trial
5478292 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf this is an internal matter of pakistan
5478293 we have been critical of pakistans interference in our internal matters in the context of the recent developments in jammu and kashmir

5478297 there are classes across this and other campuses that cover art programming and development but i see a real gap from the business side i want to try to fill that void as much as i can in only 15 weeks
5478298 the plan is for it to be platform agnostic the focus is on the business end of things the synergy between business model and game development documents as far as game examples it would be along the scale from mainstream to boutique from the huge standards such as halo 3 to causal mmos such as puzzle pirates i will try to cover the spectrum so we can examine the market dynamics that should drive development choices
5478299 there have been three cases where a boston vc was talking to one of our companies and they had the sandwich ripped right out of their hands
5478300 they miss the googles the ones that have the really extreme returns
5478301 think of us as a venture capital firm providing software web applications and guidance instead of money
5478302 along with development services prototype invest also offers to help entrepreneurs pitch their idea and newly minted prototype to investors which makes sense given that christensen and team will only make money if the app is a success at some point in the future the team is also considering offering y combinator style microfunding
5478303 and offer help working through ideation and design implementation and subsequent iteration they provide sustained support through the rapidly changing life of an early stage venture
5478304 nyc seed provides guidance from notable entrepreneurs technologists and venture capitalists we also connect companies to potential initial customers and when ready we help companies move to their next stage of development

5478431 pleased to see many grassroots efforts take shape like this one
5478432 health minister tony clement says he questions the ethics of doctors who support the use of supervised injection sites for drug addicts
5478433 the most important thing for me to remember is not to mistake my presence for the event
5478434 the event is the show the event is csi everyone has a responsibility to bring their unique talents and gifts to it and thats what im going to do im going to enter into this with the most positive attitude i can im coming to work with people who are wonderful who have made great television for nine years thats a gift all i can say is that im ready to play
5478435 fishburne will play a former pathologist who is now working as an itinerant college lecturer teaching a course in criminalistics his focus is on understanding criminal behavior how and why people commit acts of violence tendencies he disturbingly sees within himself
5478436 i think it was misreported a little bit in terms of this character having the genetic profile of a serial killer
5478437 in reality there is no such thing from the outset what we really wanted to play with in a dramatic sense is a character who has been able to examine his own genetic profile to a certain extent and find certain complexes and certain clusters of biological facts that he has in common with that is associated with aggressive or criminal behavior thats all it is obviously thats a mouthful its not as simple as saying the genetic profile of a serial killer but its just one of those things thats going to lead this character to interested in the world of violent criminals and criminalistics and forensics its what draws him to it the sense that if you find within yourself certain tendencies and see certain behaviors it lets you wonder how these things turn into murder how they turn into violence how they turn into criminal behavior thats all it is its an underlying element for the character its nothing as simple as hes got the genes of a serial killer because theres no such thing
5478438 we had talked about a particular genetic syndrome xyy at an early stage of our story development process
5478439 weve always strived to make sure that csi is as accurate as possible we have a small army of researchers and forensic consultants who work with us our initial steps into figuring out what that particular genetic syndrome was about was not really borne out by the research we changed that aspect of it a little bit but again this is a character still in development thats just the natural course of thing
5478440 let me just say that i have no knowledge of such biological profile nor would i be at liberty to speak about such biological profile if in fact such biological profile exists i dont know im just really excited that im going to be joining this team we have a lot of stuff to work out our last question was what is this characters name we have a lot of stuff to flesh out weve only had an opportunity to sit down with each other face to face one time i think over the next couple weeks well get cracking and really discover what the answers to those questions are all this stuff is discovery for everyone involved
5478441 i wouldnt say my going into weekly television series is actually stepping away from anything
5478442 its another medium in which to work as an actor because i havent done series television since pee wees playhouse its a welcome change its going to be challenging its going to be fun and its going to be exciting
5478443 to be perfectly frank i said to naren and carol mendelsohn when we met here in new york that i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show prior to having a meeting with them but im happy to say that the episodes they sent me to look at were really engaging and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work ive been involved in and i thought wow thats cool hmmm wow thisll work so im very excited
5478444 were a show that spends a lot of time thinking we dont blow stuff up were not about chasing people down and shooting people and the quality we were looking for was deep intelligence mr fishburne when you look at his work hes always brought that sensibility to the material hes done it was a perfect fit for csi
5478445 the 1 biggest mistake people make when networking is the hard sell
5478446 wishing big and doing something about it could take you places
5478447 australia will support the global ratification so if it the deal gets through the american congress we will support that decision so the answer to your question is yes we can see uranium supplies to india
5478448 in this wonderful economic time for india the biggest barrier at the moment is probably power supply and so energy needs for india is critical and if nuclear power is going to assist india in one part of that then its a good thing
5478449 the issue is not on the table yet election is seven eight months away
5478450 we have arrested 13 people on rioting charges and the situation is under control
5478451 the actor has been in touch with the bjp advaniji wished him well for the launch
5478452 he is in touch with various parties but has not taken a call on a tie up for the assembly polls
5478453 any kind of tie up with the bjp will give the actor who will otherwise win sizeable seats in coastal districts a boost in the telangana region
5478454 if the 400 acres is not returned we will not allow the factory to come up
5478455 why is he calling a meeting just when we are getting ready to launch a movement
5478456 anyway we are going for talks and we will force the government to agree to our demand
5478457 we dont know when and where the talks will be held but i am confident that they will bear fruit
5478458 im glad we didnt know at the beginning how hard it would be and how long it would take
5478459 but now that weve finally accomplished what we set out to do and much more besides it seems worth all the effort and all the headaches along the way
5478460 what amazes me is the huge range of the discoveries that have come from sdss data
5478461 we designed it primarily as a survey to map the distribution of galaxies and quasars but its also had a huge impact on the study of stars the structure of our own galaxy and even solar system objects
5478462 either we dont understand the way gravity works on the scale of the whole universe
5478463 or space is pervaded by some form of dark energy that produces repulsive gravity
5478464 even the early sdss images showed that the real milky way galaxy is much more complicated than the one i learned about in graduate school
5478465 segue has already shown us that there are important clues to the history of the galaxy and the properties of dark matter encoded in the motions of milky way stars
5478466 we expect to keep making important discoveries in the data for years to come
5478467 the ability of the sdss facility to simultaneously measure spectra of hundreds of objects over a wide area of sky remains a powerful tool for astronomy
5478468 sound waves that travel in the early universe imprint a characteristic scale on the distribution of galaxies which was first detected by the sdss
5478469 we can use this scale as a standard ruler to measure the expansion history of the universe much as supernovae have been used as standard candles
5478470 throughout its life the sdss has been a remarkable example of cooperation among public and private funding agencies and individual institutions around the world to enable science that would not otherwise be possible
5478471 visible light is where we understand the universe best but when we began the sdss there were no sensitive well characterized visible light catalogs that covered a large area of sky
5478472 now we have multi color images of 300 million celestial objects 3 dimensional maps and detailed properties of well over a million of them and its all publicly available online that changes everything
5478473 as a result the attached proposed budget calls for rate increases of 13 75 percent for water and 10 5 percent for sewer
5478474 while i believe we can reduce this somewhat i expect we will need an overall rate increase of at least 10 percent
5478475 what were looking at is a fire sale of properties in newer affordable neighborhoods that were bought or refinanced near the price peak with lousy mortgages
5478476 people can now afford the homes they couldnt have before
5478477 the houses are becoming affordable and interest rates are low thats whats driving sales
5478478 qualquer que seja a decis o n o acredito que haja maior conflito do que j houve
5478479 de modo que o tribunal v com tranq ilidade esse assunto os senhores sabem que as decis es do tribunal gozam de grande prest gio e em geral t m servido para pacificar e n o acirrar conflitos
5478480 o que o stf poder fixar s o orienta es entendimentos sobre os crit rios de legitimidade para o procedimento administrativo
5478481 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5478482 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5478483 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5478484 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5478485 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5478486 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5478487 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5478488 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5478489 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5478490 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5478491 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5478492 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5478493 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5478494 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5478495 they apologized they said it got a little heated and emotional and in the future they will instruct their employees how to act in that situation
5478496 we are very pleased with the open dialogue and we look forward to more open conversation with the group especially about how we can collectively spread a more powerful message
5478497 it was sort of a momentum shift what can you do thats the ballgame
5478498 a nice easy swing on it and put it down the right side
5478499 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
5478500 i received calls from people interested in my new business within hours of paying for a submission
5478501 we have used the perception mapping process to select winners an exhaustive survey was conducted among professionals within the industry the highlight of cw architect amp builder awards 2008 is that it is recognition and admiration by peers the awards are given by the industry to the industry the value of the awards is highlighted by the fact that the whole industry is participating in the awards
5478502 our consistent efforts in documenting success recognizing talent addressing pertinent issues and creating the awakening for a transparent and well governed industry are bearing fruit in the form of a community that is more forthright about sharing information
5478503 i havent got a clue to be honest with you i havent played many games recently so i honestly cant say
5478504 there is a big squad there and everyone is fighting for their place and i just have to train well and take the chance if i get it
5478505 you would have to ask the club i have been trying to get into the team
5478506 i havent played but i will just wait and see and when the transfer window closes we will know then
5478507 i will wait and see if i can get into the team if not then obviously i want to play so we will just have to take it from there
5478508 the trip was started with the merger of a desire to do a long distance bike trip and the current movement of the company i work for patagonia to raise awareness about the need for wildlife corridors and protection of key linkage areas for animal and plant migrations
5478509 this program will engage citizens in the u s and canada to go into wildlife corridors and upon return upload pictures and stories to google earth
5478510 i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported
5478511 the continuation of the awakening councils as they are now is unacceptable
5478512 we fought the americans for four years and we fought al qaida too
5478513 we are an experienced armed group we are fully capable of bringing the house down
5478514 it has put money in the local economy and reduced attacks on coalition forces
5478515 you can see where the money is going an irrigation pump here a renovated home there
5478516 at first i thought id have pants underwear on for the scene apparently not but ive sort of done that before on stage its all old hat now really
5478517 the united states seeks to use georgia as an energy corridor to transport caspian energy to the west without going through iran or russia to this end it helped build the btc pipeline across georgia and helped beef up the georgian military to protect it
5478518 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5478519 are you sure you want to be with her forever
5478520 it is too early for such talks the present arrangement is limited to a joint campaign on issues like inflation and the indo us nuclear deal such talks will only complicate matters
5478521 the left front concept is at present limited to kerala tripura and west bengal the arrangement should first be extended to other states where we have some presence
5478522 the idea of a third force or third alternative to counter the bjp and the congress may be a good election idea but unless and until there is a united left force efforts to strengthen our respective party organisations in other states will not go a long way
5478523 the question is about credibility we should not be seen as desperate for allies and compromising our policy positions we should be condemning police excesses
5478524 is paar bhi lenge azadi us par bhi lenge azadi
5478525 we demanding a right of self determination this is our human and democratic right and we have given every sacrifice to attain our goal
5478526 we demand that the united nations sends its delegation to kashmir to listen to this demand of people people want a complete withdrawal of indian troops from here and a referendum under the auspices of the united nations
5478527 the indian media is part and parcel of indias war machine so we want international press to visit kashmir and report the truth people here are demanding their basic rights
5478528 for the past eight years a military general of pakistan has been damaging the entire islamic nation he harmed pakistan he destroyed the kashmir cause to save his chair today he has resigned pakistans public has rejected him
5478529 we are demanding from pakistans rulers political leadership and pakistans people that pakistan had been created for the sake of islam and it should be used only for islam socialism secularism and americas world order cannot work there only islam must work there
5478530 through the relationship of islam we are all pakistanis and pakistan is ours
5478531 hum pakistani hain pakistan hamara hai we are pakistani and pakistan is ours
5478532 till now the choice of a leader of the separatists could never been made
5478533 today i am asking you whether you trust me do you trust syed ali shah geelani to lead this movement
5478534 i promise you to work for the domination of islam and will carry everyone along
5478535 registration is refused because the applied for mark merely describes a feature and characteristic of applicants services
5478536 we are aware of the ruling and will take some time to determine how we will proceed
5478537 they have driven 12 2 billion fewer miles though june of 08 compared with the same period in 07
5478538 this is the first step in changing our fossil fuel dependent culture and to a sustainable energy culture and the only reliable short term strategy for bringing down petroleum prices
5478539 la verdad siendo muy honesta yo s creo que es muy pronto para separarse pero desgraciadamente no depende tampoco tanto de nosotros seis
5478540 mientras la gente quiera esto puede durar un poco m s
5478541 ya me rega aron porque yo en el foro les dije a los fans que hagamos una marcha mundial el 23 de agosto
5478542 a adi aunque no aclar si la rega ina vino del productor que gestiona la banda pedro dami n de sus compa eros o de televisa la compa a que los impulsa
5478543 sta no es la gira del adi s todav a viene otro disco
5478544 no obviamente no yo no quiero que se acabe nadie quiere que se acabe pero creo que es importante como grupo irse en un momento importante porque quieras o no tienes que empezar a caminar t solo
5478545 no estoy nada de acuerdo con la separaci n de rbd porque m s que un simple grupo son un estilo de vida son gu as para muchos de nosotros porque a muchos nos han cambiado la vida con su m sica su moda su ideolog a y con todo lo que han hecho
5478546 alguna vez dijimos que rbd seguir a hasta que ustedes los fans quisieran ya no puede ser as dadas las circunstancias y de los caminos que abre la vida
5478547 quiero dejar claro que no fui yo ni una persona espec fica la que tom la decisi n fue un acuerdo grupal donde todos y cada uno de los que formamos parte coincidimos
5478548 we hope that the resignation of president musharraf leads to a strengthening of the civilian government and democracy in pakistan
5478549 afghanistan is in favour of a democratic and stable pakistan which is based on the rule of law
5478550 we are determined to continue our cooperation in fighting terrorism and extremism which pose challenges to both countries
5478551 he promised to fight al qaeda but played many games and was not honest about eliminating al qaeda nests located in pakistan
5478552 at least we will be free of musharrafs two faced politics and an obstacle against the war in terror will be removed which will directly affect our country
5478553 he was using both sides of the coin to his own advantage which resulted in the giving of a lot of privileges to the military intelligence agenda
5478554 we need to resolve our problems by strengthening our own capabilities and defining our priorities on how to deal with our problems in this region
5478555 we do not need a stimulus plan which would be an artificial plan
5478556 we are not in a recession but we are feeling the effects of a brutal difficult crisis
5478557 the problem is that we have extremely limited room to manoeuvre because we have wasted quite a bit over the past year so maybe we should have the courage to put the fiscal package back on the table
5478558 this would asphyxiate the economy at a time when it frankly doesnt need this
5478559 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5478560 great site great service i started submitting my press releases through mediasyndicate com over four years ago and never looked back the site has always delivered reliable and consistent results for my clients
5478561 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
5478562 i received calls from people interested in my new business within hours of paying for a submission
5478563 what are the qualities of ferdinand and terry both are very similar they have both got their attributes are both well respected by the players
5478564 they are both top internationals at the peak of their game experienced vocal in the dressing room both lead by example
5478565 they have both got all the attributes you would need as have steven gerrard as has frank lampard as has gareth barry and there are many others who will be in with a shout
5478566 but whoever gets the nod the boys will be right behind them
5478567 whoever the manager picks is going to be the right decision you need the captain more in the bad times than in the good the man who steps forward and takes responsibility
5478568 we have got so many leaders in the squad now the liverpool captain gerrard the chelsea captain terry the manchester united captain ferdinand has led united in the past but gary neville is the club captain three out of the four top teams in the country
5478569 i am sure irrespective of who takes the armband there will still be another five or six leaders out there who will go out there and take us forward
5478570 there iso much more to go with being a footballer these days because the media spotlight is on you
5478571 you have to live your life right on the pitch and off the pitch and there will be times when people make mistakes and you have to deal with criticism
5478572 there will be times when people come down on you and the captain is the link between the manager and the team and it is good to get that link because it is good to get the messages across
5478573 sometimes the manager wants the captain to get the boys to think in a certain way
5478574 sometimes the players will ask the other way even if it is something silly like can we have dinner an hour earlier because we want to watch the olympics
5478575 the public do have less patience with footballers because of the amount of money that can be earned
5478576 but when you step out onto the pitch it is not about money it is about pride in your performance just like any other sport
5478577 however the fact we get a hard time is partly our own fault
5478578 when someone makes a mistake people just say ah the footballers again
5478579 it is hard because footballers get thrown into the spotlight at a young age with not much life experience but we could do more
5478580 i have been cheering every british medal the same as everyone else
5478581 the difference is that rowers for instance have one or two championships a year footballers have to perform two or three times a week
5478582 if you got up at 4am to train your head would blow up you need to find a balance in your life
5478583 the money is there because it is a global game but people should concentrate more on the positive things like a thrilling champions league final or the title race
5478584 we need to improve and we need to stay cool and calm
5478585 it is pigeon steps we just need to go forward a little bit all the time
5478586 one week you are on top of the world the next you are at the bottom some players cope with that pressure better than others
5478587 it is a psychological barrier we need to get over
5478588 this wont happen every week there will be times when we dont play well but we need to feel even when things are going against us that we are going to win
5478589 results help that i remember how much it helped when we went 10 games unbeaten under sven goran eriksson
5478590 i think its a good use of resources it doesnt put any officers in danger which is a good thing
5478591 you can sit at a computer and find exactly where a suspect goes
5478592 law enforcement has a legitimate right to try to solve crimes and track suspects provided that there are protections so that the innocent are not improperly snooped upon
5478593 our main point with this is that before installing a gps tracking device secretly on someones vehicle a judicial officer should make the decision about how much evidence is good enough how long the tracking can be for and the parameters of the tracking
5478594 i want to point out its very easy to get a warrant if the police have a good reason it doesnt take a long time and if there is a real reason the warrant will be granted
5478595 its a lot more like a police officer tagging along inside your car an invisible police officer inside your car
5478596 the question always comes down to how much are we willing to give up in freedom and privacy for how much marginal increase in our security
5478597 the ministry has not approved funding for elaprase because of its cost and the small number of people who require the medication
5478598 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5478599 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5478600 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5478601 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5478602 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5478603 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5478604 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5478605 the nfl continues to explore new ways to feed our fans insatiable appetite to get nfl games news and highlights anytime anywhere and on any screen
5478606 nfl mobile live exclusively from sprint enables fans to enjoy thursday night football and other exclusive content on their terms
5478607 not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
5478608 a gentleman knows when it is all right to eat the garnish
5478609 when a gentleman has an unpleasant time at a restaurant he does not badger the wait staff he lodges his complaint with the management unless he is a glutton for punishment he does not go back to that restaurant
5478610 after business hours a gentleman does not carry his cellular phone into a restaurant
5478611 if a gentleman is on a diet he does not talk about it at the table
5478612 as an african american i just registered the way my parents did and the way most blacks do
5478613 no sure if this is what it is but since it was raining yesterday it does seem that something was not right at the palazzo
5478614 the soho community residents and the high end retail stores have been besieged ever since apple soho moved in the last straw was last tuesday when thousands of pre teen and teenaged girls mobbed prince and greene streets shutting it down for hours like it was shea stadium and the beatles below is a letter with links sent out to elected officials to ask for assistance in controlling apple
5478615 founded in september 1919 the communist party of the united states of america is an organization unique in american history it is not a true political party and differs fundamentally from all political parties in this country it is in fact a russian inspired moscow dominated anti american quasi military conspiracy against our government our ideals and our freedoms
5478616 one of the most loyal and pro soviet communist parties in the world and has unfalteringly accepted soviet direction and funding over the years
5478617 frank marshall davis a forgotten voice in the chicago black renaissance
5478618 from now on i knew i would be described as a communist but frankly i had reached the stage where i didnt give a damn too many people i respected as freedom fighters were listed as red for me to fear name calling
5478619 due to his associates and involvement in what were considered in the forties to be radical communist groups
5478620 however by the time he davis returned to chicago and the renaissance he inevitably associated with people connected with the communist party since they were most likely to be involved in civil rights labor art and the fight for equality it seems that davis did join the party for a short time although on other occasions he denied it
5478621 davis met richard wright through his 1936 participation in the national negro congress which was alleged to be a communist front organization
5478622 davis did not see wright again after openly criticizing wrights attack of sic the communist party following the latters defection although both men held on to the hope of equality
5478623 davis joined the league of american writers a national united front organization for the communist party mobilized by the alarming rise of power of hitler and mussolini
5478624 if the relationship with davis was as blas as the associated press makes it sound why is obama mum about it and why did he try to hide davis identity in his first memoir published in 1995
5478625 with the exception of my family and a handful of public figures the names of most characters have been changed for the sake of privacy
5478626 but there was no need to protect davis privacy he had long been dead more likely the cryptic references to his communist mentor were and still are designed to protect obamas background from the scrutiny it deserves
5478627 a history of the radical communist and working class movement in hawaii
5478628 it is not well known im afraid that before statehood in 1959 probably the most vigorous communist and radical trade union movement under the u s flag was in hawaii
5478629 a teacher will add to her syllabus baracks memoir and instruct her students to read it alongside frank marshall davis equally affecting memoir
5478630 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5478631 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5478632 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5478633 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5478634 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5478635 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5478636 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5478637 we considered the security situation nationwide and we considered the capacity of liberia government institutions to work with us
5478638 when there is charitable intent there are many scenarios where a gift of property can also be tax wise
5478639 did you pay for cb ob pw and hs hell no you pre ordered a game that money you put down goes to the games price so if you got the ce 80 dolars and put 10 on it you will only need to pay 70 to get the game now if you had to pay 80 at release after putting 10 on it then you did pay for all that stuff they give you all the stuff and perks for pre ordering the game so they have an odea how many they are gona sell have not mythic been upfront with us and if we asumed anything or did not do our own research its not their fault its ours so ask yourself would you rather wait for anything they decide to push up to be better or just throw it out their and have to fix it

5478651 hey jason do you know if chikezie is coming out
5478652 im not sure i could pinpoint a reason id have to say its curiosity
5478653 you have people who want to stop and talk to you on a bike you can stop and get the photograph you want its a different feel if you were on a bus tour you wouldnt get that
5478654 i was fascinated by it it was one of those kind of mythical things you have in the back of your mind you think that ought to be beautiful and it was
5478655 they were exceedingly polite they would signal for us to go even when they had the right of way
5478656 my wife said it was the only time she ever had to pedal downhill at a 45 degree angle
5478657 then you see that and say my god you get a sense of how they lived i look out across the way standing in a ruin and see the valleys and the mountains and wonder what was it like back then its beautiful now it couldnt have changed that much it must have been gorgeous
5478658 i was really in awe of the roman ruins at agrigento i didnt realize the romans the greeks were so involved in sicily the carthaginians the normans
5478659 it was very insightful to how the people accept even to this day in italy and sicily the role of mafia played it was fully recognized yeah they are still there
5478660 the man from avis where they rented an auto said they replace their cars every six months
5478661 if youre on the wrong road you are on the wrong road a while its just another adventure just another adventure in life
5478662 i decided to do house calls as a convenience for those type of people that would prefer a household veterinarian
5478663 people who work people with more than two or three pets its difficult for them to bring two dogs they must miss work two days
5478664 most of my clientele are not the elderly most are just people who prefer the convenience of a veterinarian going to your home
5478665 since i was 10 years old i wanted to become a veterinarian it was my goal in life
5478666 there was one other in the area but he didnt last long
5478667 il faut quil soit toujours possible de faire le bien

5478669 the average asking price in wandsworth fell from 522 000 to 481 000 in a single month or 7 9 in dollar terms of course its much worse 522 000 on july 15 was 1 045 000 while 481 000 on august 15 was 896 000 thats a drop of 149 000 or 14 3 in one month
5478670 theyre staying here for their care for a lot of good reasons
5478671 when people think of hospitals they think of patients lying on beds
5478672 so we wind up not being able to use all our beds to provide patients the private rooms they want
5478673 our board wanted to preserve state street which is a beautiful area
5478674 a new facility means a lot to an employer because its pretty indicative of the care thats being provided
5478675 see it as a long term investment part of real estate for them is owning a piece of new york
5478676 the flatiron is expensive but with the cheap dollar it made sense to increase our share
5478677 the stability of the new york real estate market is unique this current crisis will pass and the dollar will re establish itself we are confident
5478678 this isnt just about the dollar the strongest driver is that investors are looking for geographical diversification the same situation played out on wall street about 10 to 15 years ago
5478679 european companies are very much conscious of the potential windfall you buy cheap now with the belief that in 10 years the currency will have rebounded
5478680 in terms of infrastructure the u s is an emerging market
5478681 desperate times call for desperate measures and thats what were seeing from gm

5478688 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0
5478689 will give developers a chance to build polished applications once hardware is available
5478690 due to significant api changes in the upstream open source project and due to the timeline of getting certain bluetooth profile implementations certified a comprehensive bluetooth api will not be possible or present in android 1 0
5478691 due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from outside the device the data messaging facility of the gtalkservice will not be present in android 1 0
5478692 we know that these changes will affect many developers who have worked with the prior early looks at the sdk and we are very sorry for the resulting inconvenience
5478693 we look forward to the possibility of restoring some or all of this functionality in a later version of the android platform
5478694 despite an increasingly difficult enterprise spending environment in the u s and parts of europe reasonable growth expectations strength in emerging countries currency and product cycles should be enough to drive some upside for each company
5478695 theyre very high growth economies but theyre still subject to volatility
5478696 i think chinas just kind of a who knows its so hot it has to come down eventually
5478697 even if china goes from 25 percent to 15 percent year over year growth it can cause some volatility
5478698 youre going to hear notebooks doing well for both companies
5478699 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
5478700 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15 percent
5478701 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s
5478702 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth

5478711 the government has conveyed to me that the issuance of an arrest warrant against president bashir could have serious consequences for u n staff and infrastructure in sudan
5478712 we are taking all necessary precautionary measures including strengthening our cooperation with sudanese security institutions
5478713 is dictated by the necessity to preserve the stability of the country and its democratic institutions
5478714 we want national and international opinion to understand the reasons for the change on august 6 which were vital for mauritania and for the maintenance of its democracy and its pluralism
5478715 the cohesion of the overwhelming majority of mauritanian people in favor of the putsch

5478717 high energy prices across the economy rising air fares and airline schedule cuts are the primary drivers of the overall reduction in passenger volumes expected for this labor day period
5478718 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and business travelers are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all
5478719 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5478720 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period

5478725 you have to be a jew to understand what that jew just said
5478726 the fact of the matter is the plan is so complex that the ordinary american is never going to ever figure out what they even qualify for
5478727 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5478728 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5478729 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5478730 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5478731 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5478732 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5478733 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5478734 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5478735 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5478736 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama
5478737 such a show of violence is pushing kashmiri people especially our youth toward revolution
5478738 at this point i think the international community has to step in otherwise we fear a growing extremism this kind of anger comes at the worst time
5478739 pakistan has to put its political house in order before we can say what it means for kashmir

5478745 in the absence of market signals theres no way the market will solve these problems
5478746 how do we make people who have gotten something for free start paying for it thats really hard if our patterns of living our patterns of consumption are imitated as others are striving to do the world probably is not viable
5478747 our proprietary adn technology is an enormously valuable trade secret and invista takes protecting its trade secrets and other intellectual property very seriously
5478748 this suit was necessary to stop rhodia and dupont from unlawfully using invistas intellectual property to build an adn manufacturing plant in asia or elsewhere were asking the court to put an end to rhodias and duponts misconduct and award damages for the harm they have caused

5478760 tu en mi vida significas el eterno suspiro de mi alma
5478761 i havent got a clue to be honest with you i havent played many games recently so i honestly cant say
5478762 there is a big squad there and everyone is fighting for their place and i just have to train well and take the chance if i get it
5478763 you would have to ask the club i have been trying to get into the team
5478764 i havent played but i will just wait and see and when the transfer window closes we will know then
5478765 i will wait and see if i can get into the team if not then obviously i want to play so we will just have to take it from there
5478766 did seeing that display of bowling prowess give you a new appreciation for just how awesome i really am
5478767 i think they have cameras in here and i dont wanna get thrown out
5478768 it is a quiet start to the week for the markets in terms of economic data and indeed for the week as a whole things could be relatively patchy which should mean little prospect of a re think in terms of the interest rate outlook in developed markets
5478769 currency players are still factoring in how bad the european economy will be
5478770 comics are like movies tv but with an unlimited budget
5478771 they want to show nothing is safe here if it isnt under their control
5478772 the goal is to create an economic and humanitarian disaster that will rebound on the government
5478773 the russians deliberately targeted commercial operations to inflict economic damage on georgia
5478774 dropping bombs on poti port killing people i dont see how you can connect that with south ossetia
5478775 the russians want to show that they are lords of the caucasus
5478776 being in a war zone wasnt part of the job description
5478777 he said if any of you touch a hair on any of my soldiers heads well flatten the whole town
5478778 they cleaned out a store we used for old clothes used underwear old socks
5478779 they also took a black and white tv set and some tins of motor oil
5478780 at the edge of damnation sin will find you out
5478781 were here today to learn more about the universitys really quite unique expertise and capacity as it relates to their in house nuclear reactor
5478782 its going to take a federal government and a president that is open to it and candidly the outcome of this election will determine that question
5478783 i personally believe that if barack obama gets elected he will slam the door shut on these options if sen mccain is elected he will open the door to these options and allow our energy supply to be increased and take some of the pressure off our energy crisis in the country
5478784 sen obama believes that before any expansion of nuclear power is considered however that issues of security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation concerns must be addressed
5478785 but the contention that barack obama is anti nuclear is not true as a matter he has said very publicly that a nuclear energy component is part of his energy agenda
5478786 i dont think people are interested in the mileage between their community and the hometown of the nominee
5478787 i think theyre more focused on the distance of the needs of average americans and the politicians who are trying to get their votes
5478788 tim you opposed the surge so obviously reasonable people can
5478789 ill just tell you that im skeptical about the surge because i think its belated
5478790 i wish it would have happened a year ago or two years ago or three years ago that being said the decision has been made and we need to make sure that it now works
5478791 our proprietary adn technology is an enormously valuable trade secret and invista takes protecting its trade secrets and other intellectual property very seriously

5478796 people or protesters who want to express their personal opinions can go to do so
5478797 the international olympic committee and world leaders who honored beijing by attending the opening ceremonies shouldnt play deaf dumb and blind while people are hauled off for peaceful criticism
5478798 china is suppressing free expression despite its olympic pledge not to do so and the question is whether the rest of the world silently accepts that
5478799 four of our crews were able to contain the blaze to the north eastern end of the building but they discovered that that part of the building actually housed people
5478800 four of our crews were able to contain the blaze to the north eastern end of the building but they discovered that that part of the building actually housed people
5478801 i will not be watching that youre on your own
5478802 whether the questions are about abortion or poverty how could the candidates not throw in a few church based anecdotes or biblical allusions to this crowd but why surely they know that presidents dont have religious functions thats what a secular government is all about so those comments would probably be read as subtle im really more religious than that other guy winks and nods
5478803 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems
5478804 they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5478805 this is really the moment of truth for pakistan if this fails it is unclear what will happen
5478806 it will take the new government a full year to work things out on counterterrorism a year to make the mistakes they have to make it is a huge experiment
5478807 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing
5478808 pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5478809 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5478810 had a good meeting with the prime minister a couple of weeks ago in washington the pakistanis realize that the threat of terrorism the threat of extremism is a threat to them as well as the rest of the world
5478811 he hasnt effectively been leading pakistan for the last six months
5478812 youre truly not going to see any great changes in pakistan with musharrafs resignation with the exception you will start to see greater political infighting among the coalition partners
5478813 you could count on him to make tough decisions even though you could never count on him to completely follow through
5478814 it will probably be much harder to get decisive action as we did with musharraf the good news is that the democracy process is moving forward and it may be possible to create a more durable political framework
5478815 they arrested me because im black i didnt do nuthin

5478820 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5478821 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5478822 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5478823 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5478824 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5478825 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5478826 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5478827 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5478828 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5478829 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5478830 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
5478831 i want to make a name for myself in this profession
5478832 im independent now i stand on my own two feet
5478833 i have a job i work i earn in fact im living on my own which isnt an easy thing to do for a woman in pakistan for a lone woman to survive
5478834 theres not much i fear more in life than needles and blood
5478835 this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands in tax breaks for people earning 2 5 million because theyre only middle class
5478836 everyone making 2 5 million or more raise your hands
5478837 i think if youre just talking about income how about five million
5478838 the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
5478839 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5478840 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5478841 this guy obviously does not pump his own gas he obviously does not do his own shopping he obviously does not pay his own bills
5478842 but american politics is never that easy weve got to work hard weve got to earn this election
5478843 hes done so much he cant fit everything on one resume
5478844 there are several industries we have looked at that are having labour shortage crisis issues and these are all industries that timor can gain skills from
5478845 what we have proposed is 300 employees and trainees in the first pilot year and we are also requesting 100 occupational trainees
5478846 timor would certainly benefit from the fact that we have such a large youth unemployed and unskilled so called bubble
5478847 these people guest workers certainly would assist in timors national and human security recovery and development
5478848 but he proved you cannot do this on the structure of a patronage riven and police oriented political machine
5478849 wild men with hideous faces and the manners of wild beasts eaters of blood
5478850 we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year
5478851 we expect the slowdown to be at its worst towards the end of 2008 and into early 2009 we also expect inflation to start falling back from early 2009 allowing the bank of england room to cut interest rates throughout 2009 nevertheless overall the performance of uk plc through 2009 is likely to be the weakest growth since 1992 when the economy grew by just 0 3 per cent however towards the end of 2009 providing wage inflation stays low economic activity looks likely to pick up
5478852 as well as getting best value for money this will support the governments efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make scotland greener
5478853 we are doing all we can to relieve the pressure of rising fuel costs on scotland through a range of government programmes

5478927 i dont think people would be willing to risk side effects if they knew that the aim of a clinical trial was to boost profits for a pharmaceutical company
5478928 i would think that at some level this is standard practice
5478929 simply shining a bright light on their existence may have already sown the seeds of their destruction

5478946 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5478947 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5478948 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response

5478952 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5478953 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan

5478957 every man under my command owes me 100 nazi scalps and yall will git get me 100 nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead nazis or die trying
5478958 it is not just the scalping or the carving of swastikas in foreheads or the shooting of a german officers testicles or the slow strangling scene all shown with tarantinos customary love of detail that is likely to upset the german nation and its critics
5478959 it is the whole idea of turning the second world war into a comic book adventure in which not a single german character has redeeming value
5478960 i dont want it to feel like a period film this is a modern in your face movie
5478961 you acquire a lot of stuff so i decided to put it on the website mom pulled out some embarrassing stuff but im like just dont pull out my underwear

5478966 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5478967 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it she didnt even say hello she got right into her script
5478968 she had the audience prance down the street and then release black balloons it was so disorganized people fell over the press outside and almost trampled two little girls
5478969 my son went to his first drama lesson and he turned to his teacher and said dont worry im a really good actor its in my genes
5478970 i dont mind if im off the bench second or third reserve i just didnt want to miss out on being a part of the film
5478971 i feel particularly angry on behalf of early onset patients because it feels like an insult and the younger you are the more insulting it is
5478972 a lot of people with early onset have got dependents both younger and older and theyre trying to hold down a job
5478973 it is a really nasty disease and i cannot imagine cancer patients being denied a drug like this in similar circumstances
5478974 he is unable to control his anger in front of the children
5478975 gwyneth paltrow should be ashamed i can only assume that paltrow either is ignorant of the facts or lacks human decency and compassion
5478976 weve written to her many times and sent her videos showing how animals suffer for fur but have never received a response
5478977 apparently her beauty really is only skin deep gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur its a terrible example to set for a young child
5478978 shes got problems just like all of us have about what happened to my mum
5478979 ive been in therapy not long ago and she has had a hard time
5478980 thats why she has done drugs and why this wedding happened too were all depressed in our family
5478981 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5478982 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5478983 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5478984 im doing it because i want to do it not because i have to do it and i miss doing it and it scares me
5478985 im excited by the prospect of doing it and terrified when you perform live is theres no ambiguity people either laugh or they dont
5478986 i thought what can i do to make my babies proud i think about what theyll think about the year they were born who i was and what i did
5478987 working out and getting back into shape isnt exciting to me but training for a triathlon is theres a goal at the end of it something to reach for
5478988 thats been really hard i auditioned without having read the script pretty much exactly the way i played it character in the movie
5478989 i filmed for only about a week so i didnt get that much one on one time with sofia coppola when the movie came out eight or nine months later and these questions started coming i felt blindsided i felt defensive at first i felt so terrible about the whole thing

5478996 i just wanted to put it to bed now obviously we wanted to get it sorted out this year but with the new manager coming in and players coming in and out there wasnt enough time
5478997 the reality is that we think and the manager thinks that if august 31 comes and we are what we now then we have a squad
5478998 and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren
5478999 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect
5479000 we are witnessing a new cult in shiism whose leaders claim to be connected to the imam
5479001 is in charge of the world and we see his hand directing all the affairs of the country
5479002 some charlatans have started saying we had breakfast with the imam or had the noon prayer with him
5479003 this is a plot to fool the young generation of religious innocent and pious people
5479004 they can prove especially popular when combined with special care for the poorest segments of society as mr ahmadi nejad is doing
5479005 the rate of fee increases is levelling off as non executive directors and the boards that employ are working harder to balance fees with the responsibilities that come with the role
5479006 the type and size of organisation and the number of service days all have an impact on the fee levels together with the specific responsibilities of non executive directors which in part explains the wide range of fees now paid to the chairman
5479007 i am delighted to welcome andrew to the company his business ethics and cultural values are closely aligned with our own which is extremely important to us andrew is a highly effective development professional and the positive impact he will make upon our business will be considerable
5479008 as a result of the current economic turbulence many employers are adopting a cautious approach towards hiring nevertheless it is evident that a number of smaller companies and firms are taking advantage of the reduced competition from larger players and viewing the situation as an ideal opportunity to secure high calibre accountants
5479009 interim working has exposed me to a variety of roles for a number of very high profile clients

5479018 you want people to think well of you dont you
5479019 graduates can be amazing assets to any organisation and if supported and developed properly will be the driving force for future success
5479020 the last thing graduates want is to be back in the classroom as they are more than ready to get stuck in and kick start their careers it is for this reason why it is imperative that the learning they receive for business skills is impactful innovative and more importantly fun and engaging
5479021 its sophisticated progressive music thats driven by a rocknroll feel but i really think that my music sometimes slips from those definitions and creates a new entity the main influences range from the progressive rock groups of the seventies such as yes rush pink floyd deep purple and king crimson to newer metal bands like metallica megadeth porcupine tree dream theater and many more
5479022 the mediterranean and ethnic characters that this country holds are alive and well in my music whether i like it or not
5479023 i think the contrast of a european country mixed with an ethnic one thats the way i see israel is exactly whats happening on this album its not a bad thing its one of the things that make the music original and special
5479024 before the first note was composed for this album i knew i wanted daniel to be on it
5479025 apart from being a very talented musician and gifted vocalist i think that hes something very unique in the progressive genre and to me symbolizes the endless possibilities of the progressive genre to evolve it was great working with him and i think he adds a new aspect to the album he did a great job writing the lyrics for his song and of course recording the vocals
5479026 this match was initially suggested by steven wilson who suggested that i should listen to her band paatos and consider adding her to the project so i did and it was love at first listen she has a unique voice and feel that i just had to have on this album after hearing her voice i wrote haze in less than five minutes inspired by the collaboration that could be our collaboration was so successful that petronella added her voice to a second song real along with the main vocalist lior seker
5479027 not long after he got back to me and was very excited about what he had heard wanting to meet me in tel aviv steven offered to mix and master the album his mix makes the album what it is he understands music and knows how to handle it to get it where it belongs

5479066 it was a really really poor decision by some of our key guys at joe gibbs racing and i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys
5479067 a couple of guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5479068 our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5479069 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5479070 i know theyre probably frustrated about having less horsepower than ever before and wanted to make it look like were handicapped more than ever before i understand that but thats not an excuse
5479071 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5479072 we will also investigate internally how this incident took place and who was involved and make whatever decisions are necessary to ensure that this kind of situation never happens again

5479085 last year there were 60 qbs that started in the regular season
5479086 unless all 60 are better than me i expect that my career in the nfl will continue
5479087 i am not convinced that i would gain anything from having an agent at this point in my career
5479088 when i visited the packers i felt real good about the opportunity to back up aaron rodgers on a good team
5479089 i just sensed that when it was time to negotiate that there were some unresolved issues that kept them from giving me a market value offer i think that the brett favre situation was in the background while they were dealing with me
5479090 i just was not willing to take the vet minimum and no guaranteed roster spot
5479091 fyi i never said i wanted to start in pittsburgh
5479092 i was encouraged by league personnel to contact the vikings during free agency to gauge their interest
5479093 i had a good conversation with coach brad childress and i have no hard feelings toward the organization
5479094 the trade discussions were initiated by the vikings and some teams during the nfl combine
5479095 once that was exposed i merely pushed to be involved in the discussions since i was representing myself i regret that there was a lack of understanding between the team and me
5479096 the situation had all of the ingredients for a perfect storm i needed to get out from under a long term deal that had no guarantees left they needed a commitment from their quarterback to get to town and learn their new system the fact that i was injured and it was recommended that i rehab in a warm climate only complicated the matter
5479097 looking at the results of the survey it seems highly unrealistic that a graduate with approximately 15 000 of debt will be able to save anywhere near enough for a deposit to buy a house within five years in the current mortgage market
5479098 weve calculated that a graduate on a salary of 19 000 would have a maximum of 126 per month left over after living expenses rent student loan repayments utility bills and pension payments to save for a deposit on a house this is before we start talking about taking a holiday or two during the year

5479149 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5479150 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5479151 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant

5479170 it is a damn poor mind indeed which cant think of at least two ways to spell any word
5479171 the fall in uk house prices that began in september of 2007 has driven down the level of wealth tied up in uk housing by around 400bn 1 representing a 9 fall year on year of the value of the uks housing stock over the twelve month period to june 2008
5479172 in addition to this the drop in value of finance related equities has generated a loss of stock market capitalisation of around 200bn 2 for finance related firms in the year to june 2008 the combined loss of national wealth of around 600bn will add to downward pressures on uk economic growth over the next year
5479173 its clear that cfos in todays much more uncertain economic environment are dealing with numerous challenges and they both expect and need to play an increased role in the strategic direction of the business providing information to enable better business decisions to be made
5479174 the companies that will be successful in addressing the challenges identified will take a holistic view across the underlying management processes information requirements technology needs and the people organisation dimension in order to play a greater role in the strategic direction of the business the finance function must take a greater view of the whole business
5479175 the figures show that flows of business into the island have slowed over the past few months this reflects the fact that in the wider markets there is less confidence as a result of the credit crunch not withstanding this it is encouraging to see that overall guernseys finance industry continues to perform robustly
5479176 it is very good news indeed that despite the market conditions we are still seeing funds business coming into the island
5479177 there is still a lot of international corporate wealth out there looking for a structure and that is what we are so experienced and skilled at catering for but what we need to see is greater confidence to put the business into place
5479178 as a result of this fragile confidence we have seen a slowdown in the growth of our funds business but in some respects this has been beneficial at the current rate practitioners can make sure that service levels on the substantial business that they have taken in over the past few years are as high as we would expect and that they are well placed for when confidence returns and business levels increase
5479179 what is encouraging is that we are continuing to see deposits coming into the island we have seen a drop in deposits this quarter primarily because a block of swiss fiduciary business was transferred out of the jurisdiction to another part of the group but other deposits continue to increase those in the market are aware that there are some very good deposit products provided by the banks and building societies in guernsey

5479194 mich w rde mal interessieren was passiert wenn wie in den usa oder italien die ganze liga streikt und damit den spielbetrieb an mehreren wochen einstellt man muss sich dagegen wehren dass dem fu ball in deutschland unterstellt wird auf kosten der ffentlichen hand seine spiele durchzuf hren
5479195 ich gebe herrn bierhoff in seiner einsch tzung recht dass die pr senz der politik im profifu ball h her ist als die effektivit t dem fu ball auf gesetzlicher oder sonst einer ebene zu helfen wir wollten die dinge nicht berziehen und versuchen auf anderem weg eine l sung zu finden streik ist f r mich das letzte mittel
5479196 ich bin nicht f r streik aber wenn wir so weitermachen landen wir sportlich im niemandsland man muss mit der scheinheiligkeit aufh ren es reicht nicht wenn sich die solidarit t der politiker darauf beschr nkt bei uns der ehrentrib ne zu sitzen
5479197 herr bierhoff ist nicht befugt sich zu bundesliga belangen zu u ern allerdings ist es sympathisch wenn er sich um die rolle des bundeskartellamts bei der vergabe der tv rechte sorgt

5479200 the effect will be really in what they dont see
5479201 we felt it would be something that the cities and county would be interested in hearing of how we are dealing with our budget cuts
5479202 i would guess that if you asked the typical student hey with all the cuts have you noticed anything unless theyre mistaken they wont be able to say well yeah my classes are much bigger because we havent raised class size
5479203 at a minimum my guess would be it would increase class size
5479204 and if the state pulls back some of their programs that will have a dramatic affect on supplemental educational programs that have been put in place and professional development for teachers and those types of things that obviously are critical to a world class district
5479205 in several respects what the public was told about the nature of the club and what it had to offer was seriously misleading it was what was said at the presentations which induced people to pay a large sum for a facility that is club membership which in reality was worth very little
5479206 given the severity of endeavors plcs cashflow problem the most likely alternative to this deal was liquidation therefore we are pleased to have secured a deal to sell the business and assets of endeavors plc that allows trading to continue safeguarding 54 jobs largely in the us and offering the prospect of a return to secured creditors
5479207 with the economy slowing and energy bills on the rise it is totally unacceptable that hard pressed businesses are left so open to exploitation by energy suppliers ofgems investigation into the industry must hold the suppliers to account over the very apparent lack of transparency and fairness in their dealings with business

5479209 an obvious solution would be establishing a separate watchdog dedicated to assisting businesses

5479233 we hebben leiderschap en structurele beslissingen nodig die onze welvaart veilig stellen en dat kan alleen maar door een fundamentele staatshervorming
5479234 wij betreuren dat op het federale niveau niet iedereen aan hetzelfde zeel trekt terwijl de economische vergrijzingsbom tikt en de internationale economische tsunami op ons afkomt schuiven verschillende politieke partijen hun eigen politieke agenda systematisch naar voren waar zijn de staatsmannen en staatsvrouwen naartoe die aan de toekomst van dit land durven of kunnen denken en daarbij moeilijke beslissingen durven nemen om zo doorbraken te realiseren
5479235 de politieke impasse zal de investeringsagenda van de ondernemingen schade toebrengen en de beschermingsagenda voor de sociale zekerheid op de helling zetten de 500 000 extra jobs die tegen 2020 nodig zijn om de internationale groeikracht van de ondernemingen en de interpersoonlijke solidariteit voor de zieken en gepensioneerden te verdienen komt steeds meer in gevaar voka blijft daarom vragen naar leiderschap en structurele beslissingen die de welvaart voor onze jongeren voorbereiden en dat kan alleen maar door een fundamentele staatshervorming waarbij de deelregeringen de stuwende krachten zijn
5479236 een effici ntere overheid met een verlaging van de uitgavenquote met 5 van het bbp en een staatshervorming die meer fiscale autonomie gunt aan de regios en daarmee de regios direct responsabliseert zijn de belangrijkste opdrachten die toppolitici in dit land moeten waarmaken dit heeft niets te maken met separatisme dit is een harde noodzaak om ons land te redden van het bankroet
5479237 ford is a leader in safety and fuel economy not even toyota or honda can match the new escapes safety and fuel efficiency ratings

5479248 we are heading for a pensions crunch as nervous trustees demand more cash from companies just as those companies have less of it
5479249 at a time when cash is plentiful using it to clear debt can be a very good idea similar to a householder flush with cash deciding to pay off a mortgage early but as the credit squeeze tightens financial obligations need to be prioritised and if pensions can be met over a longer time period that can reduce the demand for cash outgoings today this flexibility ought to improve the long term health of companies which is the pension trustees primary interest
5479250 a sustained fall in the markets will inevitably lead to an increase in assessed pension deficits and increasing mortality assumptions will add further pressure how the pension trustees react to this can have a profound effect on a company additional cash pumped in now may make the trustees feel better but in practice will make little difference relative to the impact of market movements and long term company strength trustees are very long term creditors and need to work with companies to develop a coherent strategy to manage pensions through these turbulent times
5479251 we take the matter of misreporting seriously we can only regulate effectively and protect consumers if companies provide reliable accurate and complete data

5479260 the fbi is embarking on a 1 billion effort to build the worlds largest computer database of peoples physical characteristics a project that would give the government unprecedented abilities to identify individuals in the united states and abroad
5479261 digital images of faces fingerprints and palm patterns are already flowing into fbi systems in a climate controlled secure basement here next month the fbi intends to award a 10 year contract that would significantly expand the amount and kinds of biometric information it receives and in the coming years law enforcement authorities around the world will be able to rely on iris patterns face shape data scars and perhaps even the unique ways people walk and talk to solve crimes and identify criminals and terrorists the fbi will also retain upon request by employers the fingerprints of employees who have undergone criminal background checks so the employers can be notified if employees have brushes with the law
5479262 the increasing use of biometrics for identification is raising questions about the ability of americans to avoid unwanted scrutiny
5479263 it is drawing criticism from those who worry that peoples bodies will become de facto national identification cards critics say that such government initiatives should not proceed without proof that the technology really can pick a criminal out of a crowd
5479264 the use of biometric data is increasing throughout the government for the past two years the defense department has been storing in a database images of fingerprints irises and faces of more than 1 5 million iraqi and afghan detainees iraqi citizens and foreigners who need access to u s military bases the pentagon also collects dna samples from some iraqi detainees which are stored separately

5479317 three years ago he did the exact same thing he grew out of his relationship to his wife and transferred his affection to another thats the biggest frustration with us the bottom line is that he was traveling too much and not taking care of his wife and family like he should
5479318 one of the things we dont understand is how god uses people of flawed character people ask me why choose someone whos dysfunctional because god does it
5479319 this is a personal failing on todds part and he can recover from it its not an excuse to live a sloppy life but there should be some encouragement here god knew ahead of time todds frailty but chose to use him anyway

5479341 james muffett said friday that during the meeting mccain said he respected social conservatives views and believed that republican presidents from ronald reagan on could not have won without them
5479342 among likely voters 27 would be more likely to support mccain with huckabee on the ticket

5479353 cisco is gratified by the courts sanction orders we hope that king amp spalding will use the courts order as an opportunity to reflect upon their professionalism
5479354 failure to engage in a meaningful discussion with cisco ironport regarding these discovery issues
5479355 essentially called for every document at cisco ironport that deals with the accused products in this case which means in effect every document in the company
5479356 filled the record with invective in both challenging the motives of cisco ironport with respect to allegedly delaying discovery and challenging the honesty of cisco ironports counsel with respect to their representations to the court
5479357 mischaracterizing and misrepresenting the course of discovery and the communications between the parties
5479358 anything to avoid being held liable for the failure to meaningfully engage in discovery in this case
5479359 in light of this record the court finds that the above quoted statement from plaintiffs counsel is extremely disturbing
5479360 an adequate basis for provoking this enormously costly to the parties and enormously burdensome to the court discovery dispute and motions practice

5479363 many in the business community will welcome todays decision by the mpc to keep interest rates at 5
5479364 we are experiencing falling confidence as costs are rising and consumers have less disposable income therefore a reduction in rates would have helped
5479365 in speaking with local businesses i understand that the media and communications sector is operating with full order books and some are even looking to recruit staff and at a meeting with a local estate agent i was told that they are operating at 90 occupancy with their city centre property portfolio and that rental yield has risen by 2 5 in the last 12 months
5479366 however with inflationary pressures mounting the economy and business in general needs a cut in interest rates we would now urge the mpc to monitor the economy closely and not be afraid to cut rates in the coming months
5479367 unprecedented market conditions in the number of their business lines
5479368 no one here thinks that these results are in any shape or form satisfactory it has been a chastening experience and reporting a pre tax loss of 691m is something i and my colleagues regret very much this loss is a consequence of previously signalled writedowns on credit market exposures amounting to 5 9bn
5479369 in response to these new market conditions we moved decisively to strengthen our capital position materially
5479370 in so doing we are acutely aware that we drew heavily on our shareholders for financial support and we recognise that we must now deliver a level of performance that meets their expectations
5479371 the difficult conditions in the financial markets look set to be compounded by a deteriorating economic outlook with consensus forecasts pointing to slowing growth in many countries
5479372 we are focused on very difficult market conditions we are focused here very much on doing whats right for our shareholders and to steer the business through a difficult time
5479373 we have steered it through good times and we are going to steer it through these times
5479374 trading over the internet for direct transactions or order processing has very low margins offering a cost effective alternative to the traditional commercial environment
5479375 many businesses are embracing the benefits of the internet however driving sales online may make firms vulnerable to issues such as corporate identity and credit card fraud
5479376 in addition e transactions reduce the need for personal contact making it harder to sense when a customer might be going through difficult times
5479377 in todays challenging economic climate businesses need to be more vigilant than ever and that means keeping a close eye on customers accounts

5479382 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5479383 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5479384 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5479385 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5479391 the pain of a broken heart really does hurt as much as a kick in the gut new research shows scientists have found that the brain processes emotional pain in the same way as physical pain they are also processed in the same area of the brain the anterior cingulate cortex brain imaging shows that grief activates neurons in the reward center of the brain giving addictive like properties to memories of a lost love said david alexander director of the center for trauma research in aberdeen scotland

5479403 the credit squeeze and pressure from rising inflation is hitting small businesses hard and there is a temptation not to spend money on checks of new customers and suppliers
5479404 but the fact is that rigorous credit checks supported by ongoing monitoring of customers and suppliers financial status are key to help businesses of all sizes protect their cash flow and avoid bad debt

5479406 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
5479407 even if we avoid the scale of jobs fallout suffered in previous downturns the era of the candidates recruitment market is already over with people in work becoming increasingly anxious that their p45 might soon be on its way
5479408 companies are now reacting to deteriorating market conditions with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure
5479409 it looks as if employment costs the main area over which businesses retain control are taking the strain with employers seeking both to keep a lid on pay settlements and in increasing numbers planning for redundancies the labour market is suddenly looking a lot less resilient

5479413 the data has already been unrelentingly bleak and many are warning the economy could soon tip into the first recession since the early 1990s when hundreds of thousands lost their jobs and homes

5479420 it seems that labours unpopular plans for a national road pricing scheme are alive and well
5479421 they are determined to press ahead with their untried and untested spy in the sky national project even though it looks like an it disaster waiting to happen ruth kelly should start listening to drivers and scrap these pilots for a national road pricing scheme that is unnecessary and unwanted
5479422 if the government was true to its word and was kicking road pricing into the long grass why is it running trials
5479423 ministers have said that national road pricing is no longer on the agenda so either they are wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers money or they are not being honest with voters
5479424 we have been absolutely clear that any proposal for national road pricing would need to address the legitimate concerns people have

5479426 whether a marriage performed by a person professing muslim faith with his wifes sister while his earlier marriage with the other sister was still subsisting would be void in law or merely irregular or voidable even though the subsequent marriage may have been consummated
5479427 the answer is that the bar of unlawful conjunction renders a marriage irregular and not void
5479428 consequently under the hanafi law as far as muslims in india are concerned an irregular marriage continues to subsist till terminated in accordance with law and the wife and children would be entitled to maintenance under section 125 of crpc

5479461 nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
5479462 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
5479463 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
5479464 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
5479465 the prince of wales is a very welcome champion of farmers not only nationally but internationally as a farmer himself he is all too aware of the brilliance that most possess in cherishing the countryside and their farms
5479466 as so often the prince of waless views are in tune with public opinion in questioning the value of gm crops for poor small scale farmers in developing countries his comments also chime with the recent international agricultural assessment by 400 scientists from around the world which questioned whether gm crops offered any solutions to global poverty hunger or climate change
5479467 prince charles is absolutely right to have raised this issue now in the midst of a sustained cynical and sinister pr campaign from the gm industry based on the myth that gm crops and foods are somehow going to solve the worlds hunger crisis
5479468 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
5479469 its easy to scoff at the princes latest green intervention but if you really look at what hes saying its completely cogent prince charles warnings that genetically modified crops and industrial agriculture will lead to ecological disaster appear only to be adding a dose of passion to the cooler analysis of the worlds leading agronomists climate scientists and grassroots groups in developing countries who have been saying much the same about farming and ecology for some time
5479470 despite the clamour however he is as john vidal observes essentially right
5479471 large agribusiness companies together with their supporters in public science are now promoting gm crops as the solution to problems they themselves have created
5479472 prince charles is to be applauded for raising these issues
5479473 many of us in india are watching and reading with keen interest the reports coming out of the uk on prince charles statements and views on gm crops there are scores of civil society organisations which have recorded appreciation of the princes views here he is right in pointing out that genetic engineering will compound the problems that exist why wouldnt they given that we are turning to the same corporations which have created the problems in the first place millions of smallholder farmers in countries like mine will have sustainable livelihoods only when they getaway from corporate science amp technology seeking profits all the time
5479474 i love it when prince charles lets rip as he did this week over genetically modified crops the politicians wet themselves its refreshing to hear a public figure talk crop instead of crap
5479475 i think monsanto saw the handwriting on the wall and gave up
5479476 no one wants the growth hormone rbgh used in milk production not even the company that makes it
5479477 if genetically engineered products like this were safe monsanto would put made with ge in big block letters on all its products
5479478 because of transgenic soy we have been losing our experts on weeds and those who remain are working for the companies that produce genetically modified seeds and glyphosate
5479479 so how in the world did we take a weed like horseweed that 15 years ago wasnt a problem weed and make it a huge problem
5479480 the us army developed high grade weaponised anthrax in order it said to work out what would happen if someone else did the same no one else was capable of producing it the terrorist who posted envelopes of anthrax in 2001 took it from one of the armys laboratories now us researchers are preparing genetically modified strains of smallpox on the same pretext and with the same likely consequences
5479481 the volunteer reapers identified four fields of mon810 in vienne
5479482 if our bees were to come in touch with the genetically modified maize and the honey was contaminated with it we would not be allowed to sell it
5479483 after some good weeks in spring bees are threatened by famine because later in the year there are almost no more blooming flowers
5479484 you can see that in vast regions especially in the eastern part of the country there is nothing for bees to feed on
5479485 the bbka demands more taxpayers money for research into bee diseases while at the same time taking money from bayer to endorse pesticides that are known to be toxic to bees
5479486 analytical reports received from the ivri izatnagar and department of animal husbandry hyderabad have confirmed that sheep death in ap andhra pradesh cannot be attributed to bt cotton
5479487 conducted no experiment on grazing or feeding of bt plants
5479488 no information on these aspects has been provided to the genetic engineering approval committee
5479489 it is necessary that review must take place during a full moratorium on all gm crops including bt cotton
5479490 increasing interference in agricultural policy by a few scientists who are marginal to agriculture and from a variety of unqualified groups
5479491 gm crop technology itself isnt ready to save the world despite gms potential the technology faces substantial technical and economic barriers before it will spark a second green revolution barriers that arent being discussed in the newly energized debate over genetically modified food
5479492 inconceivable in todays world that such an emergency would re occur
5479493 as a rich country open to trade the uk is well placed to access sufficient foodstuffs through a well functioning world market

5479510 en die lousewies bakt er ook al niet veel van
5479511 ik had verwacht dat jullie de vier overgebleven zetels zouden vieren
5479512 ik dacht dit valt ze reuze mee maar nee lousewies vond de uitslag pet en jij ook hoor ik
5479513 heb je het gehoord hij was giftig zei hij en hij vond giftig blijkbaar wel een raakte term want hij herhaalde het woord overal waar hij de kans kreeg op de pvda was hij giftig want die hadden gezegd dat de vvd alleen villas voor de rijken wilde bouwen zijn campagne bestond uit niet meer dan n grote aanval op de pvda maar toen vriendelijke wouter iets terug zei werd hij dus giftig en in zn allerlaatste afscheidswoord ook een beetje emotioneel was een mooi gezicht
5479514 slim als vooral de socialisten hebben gewonnen hij noemde de vvd zelfs een sociaal liberale partij eerst sociaal vond ik toch opvallend dan moet het wel erg slecht gaan met de vvd
5479515 natuurlijk heeft ook wiegel zich weer afgemeld kan ie zich over een jaartje ofzo weer rustigjes aanmelden een prima systeem als je van koddige olifantjes in porseleinkasten houdt ik persoonlijk kan weinig met de man het wordt haast een beetje zielig
5479516 vind het wel dapper dat jij dit allemaal zo sterk weet te stellen
5479517 met je vier zetels en lokaal zelfs gehalveerd heb je trouwens balkenende nog gezien vond m zo jolig de laatste dagen
5479518 hij leek wel high waar lousewies haar verlies nog pet vond leek balkenende haast opgelucht blij dat presidentschap moet hem wel heel erg zwaar vallen
5479519 ik ga voor het presidentschap niets meer maar ook zeker niets minder
5479520 leuk zijn die kleintjes nog h wacht maar tot ze wat ouder zijn
5479521 ach jongen wat heb je het toch zwaar en wat vind ik dat toch zielig
5479522 maar dat kan niet ik ben nog aan het werk

5479584 when you look at low power fm or ultra wide band rules the technology has great promise but the commission adopted rules that constrained it to the detriment of consumers
5479585 so of course there are concerns that that the rules could be too limiting
5479586 me siento muy bien aqu y me gusta la ciudad en yiwu china podemos comprar f cilmente todo tipo de mercanc as por ejemplo la compra de productos transportados por contenedores y compra de muestras de peque o volumen los comerciantes de yiwu son muy eficaces e inteligentes y tengo muy buena experiencia con ellos
5479587 muchos de mis amigos y compa eros conocen la ciudad de yiwu y tienen muy buena impresi n sobre la calidad y variedad de las mercanc as que se encuentran aqu china est experimentando un r pido crecimiento y muchos comerciantes extranjeros incluy ndome a m encontramos innumerables oportunidades que uno no puede dejar pasar
5479588 aqu se ven muchas mercanc as interesantes deseo comprar muchas cosas pero claro tengo que fijarme en los precios
5479589 es un gran centro comercial con una administraci n avanzada nos ofrece muchas facilidades y servicios completos tales como la instalaci n de los tel fonos y el acceso al internet todo esto nos permite estar al corriente de las informaciones m s recientes sobre el mercado y la demanda asimismo tambi n podemos encontrar restaurantes de comida coreana y comer los t picos platos de nuestro pa s
5479590 desde fines de la d cada de 1970 momento en que comenz a aplicarse la pol tica de reforma y apertura el gobierno municipal de yiwu ha llevado activamente a la pr ctica la estrategia de desarrollar la ciudad mediante el fomento del comercio y la promoci n de un desarrollo socioecon mico r pido y multifac tico regulado por el mercado hace 20 a os los yiwuneses empezamos a hacer pruebas para convertir nuestra ciudad en uno de los principales centros nacionales de peque os productos en china esas iniciativas experimentales desempe aron un papel decisivo en el despegue econ mico de yiwu cuya situaci n geogr fica es ciertamente ventajosa adem s de encontrarse en el centro de la provincia de zhejiang est rodeada de ciudades que son importantes centros de las industrias ligera y textil decididos a aprovechar esa ventaja en 1982 los habitantes de yiwu organizamos la feria nacional de peque os productos la primera y la mayor de su g nero en la china de aquel entonces poco a poco el comercio de peque os productos fue convirti ndose en el pilar de la econom a local y en el emblema del municipio de yiwu
5479591 la mayor a de nuestros productos se exportan principalmente a los pa ses rabes los ee uu y am rica latina la verdad es que la venta minorista a los comerciantes nacionales es muy reducida la raz n es muy simple la venta de l mparas decorativas en los mercados extranjeros reporta ganancias decenas de veces superiores a las que obtenemos vendi ndolas en el interior de china no puedo darle datos sobre nuestras exportaciones ya que es un secreto comercial pero s puedo asegurarle que son muy elevadas y rentables
5479592 en solo un mes exportamos veinte o treinta contenedores de zapatos casi todos se exportan a oriente medio y frica con la venta de un par de zapatos las ganancias brutas son muy reducidas en cambio los contratos de venta al por mayor que firmamos con los empresarios extranjeros ascienden a decenas de miles yuanes
5479593 ahora yiwu ha devenido en la mayor base de producci n de joyas de la parte continental por lo que los precios de yiwu determinan los precios al por menor de mi negocio

5479599 el pa s est secuestrado por una minor a rapaz que s lo ha provocado una creciente inseguridad y violencia
5479600 cinco acciones para que el gobierno usurpador frene el proceso de degradaci n progresiva que afecta a la sociedad en su conjunto y a la vida p blica de m xico
5479601 la soluci n de fondo en el combate a la delincuencia la m s humanitaria eficaz y probablemente la menos cara consiste en combatir el desempleo la pobreza la desintegraci n familiar la p rdida de valores y la ausencia de alternativas pero ninguna de ellas ha iniciado el gobierno del presidente pelele felipe calder n
5479602 en primer lugar subray se debe evitar la privatizaci n abierta o disfrazada de la industria petrolera nacional y mantener la lucha hasta rechazar por completo las iniciativas de reformas que presentaron calder n y el pri a consideraci n del congreso
5479603 la segunda propuesta prosigui consiste en que la c mara de diputados autorice un mayor presupuesto a las universidades p blicas para que los j venes que son rechazados tengan la oportunidad de estudiar y no se les orille a tomar el camino de las conductas antisociales
5479604 porque es necesario ver el gasto destinado a la juventud como una inversi n social
5479605 mouri o es un delincuente confeso mientras que garc a y medina ocuparon durante el gobierno foxista los cargos de director de la agencia federal de investigaciones afi y secretario de seguridad p blica federal y durante todo este tiempo ambos han demostrado falta de integridad e ineficiencia
5479606 la cuarta acci n especific el presupuesto p blico se debe canalizar al impulso de las actividades productivas a la creaci n de empleos y a garantizar el bienestar de la poblaci n en tanto el gobierno de facto no ha hecho nada para reducir su enorme gasto burocr tico por el contrario en 2007 lo aument en 154 mil millones de pesos y hasta ahora su gasto corriente en 2008 se proyecta en 250 mil millones m s es decir en s lo 2 a os sumar 404 mil millones de pesos
5479607 la ltima acci n se al es continuar insistiendo hasta lograr una renovaci n tajante de la vida p blica nada o poco se lograr mientras se mantenga este r gimen de opresi n corrupci n y privilegios
5479608 la aplicaci n de la pol tica salinista que convirti al gobierno en un comit al servicio de una minor a de banqueros hombres de negocios vinculados al poder especuladores traficantes de influencias y pol ticos corruptos
5479609 todas las acciones de gobiernos neoliberales tanto priistas como panistas se orientaron a mantener y acrecentar los privilegios de unos cuantos sin importar el destino del pa s y la suerte de la mayor a de los mexicanos
5479610 con la llegada de vicente fox se fortaleci y se hizo m s vulgar la red de complicidades actualmente ha quedado suficientemente claro que quienes urdieron y llevaron a cabo el fraude electoral del 2006 lo hicieron para seguir imponiendo una pol tica econ mica contraria al inter s popular y a la soberan a nacional
5479611 los responsables del clima de violencia e inseguridad que prevalece en el pa s tienen nombre y apellido se llaman felipe calder n vicente fox carlos salinas roberto hern ndez elba esther gordillo dirigentes del consejo coordinador empresarial y due os de medios de comunicaci n la violencia se increment en m xico porque la mafia de la pol tica que impuso a felipe calder n en la presidencia de la rep blica contin a aplicando una pol tica econ mica antipopular y entreguista que ha desatado una descomposici n social
5479612 el fraude caus un da o inmenso lastim los sentimientos de millones de mexicanos socav a las instituciones envileci por entero a la llamada sociedad pol tica y quien actualmente se ostenta como presidente de la rep blica no s lo carece de autoridad moral sino que su ineptitud es cada vez m s evidente expres el domingo en su misiva al pueblo de m xico
5479613 habr tranquilidad social cuando haya oportunidades para todos cuando hay mucha gente desempleada econ micamente despose da y sin esperanzas es mayor la tentaci n de escapar de la amarga realidad mediante las drogas y la violencia
5479614 aquellos que se creen amos y se ores de m xico no se ponen a pensar que si se aprobaran las reformas que propone calder n para privatizar la industria petrolera conllevar a una mayor pobreza y desempleo as como a una mayor frustraci n y violencia un escenario de ese tipo ni a ellos mismos les conviene porque nadie podr a vivir en un pa s con tanto desorden social
5479615 pese a actuar con impunidad y corrupci n carlos romero deschamps no ser destituido como l der del sindicato de trabajadores petroleros de la rep blica mexicana stprm porque lo protege el presidente pelele felipe calder n a cambio de que apoye la llamada reforma energ tica calder n tiene compromisos con romero deschamps a tal grado que en la iniciativa de privatizaci n del petr leo no se toca el tema de la corrupci n en el sindicato de pemex hay un acuerdo entre calder n hinojosa y romero deschamps para mantener la corrupci n en el organismo sindical a cambio de que apoye la reforma calderonista
5479616 los sindicalizados de pemex tienen que soportar a su l der corrupto como tambi n el pueblo de m xico tiene que soportar desgraciadamente a un presidente usurpador que no tiene autoridad moral y adem s no tiene capacidad para enfrentar grandes y graves problemas del pa s
5479617 no permitiremos que entreguen la industria petrolera porque el petr leo es garant a para sacar adelante a m xico tenemos yacimientos petrol feros en la costa del golfo de m xico en tamaulipas san luis potos veracruz tabasco campeche y chiapas adem s la extracci n de un barril de 160 litros cuesta 40 pesos y petr leos mexicanos lo vende en mil 120 pesos lo que significa que obtiene mil 160 pesos por cada unidad y pemex produce 3 millones de barriles diarios de petr leo
5479618 si al final de la consulta popular el pri y el pan insisten en aprobar la iniciativa calderonista de ser necesario vamos a movilizarnos a nivel nacional vamos a parar al pa s pero no vamos a permitir la entrega del petr leo
5479619 los panistas de arriba quieren poner de ejemplo a guanajuato como una forma de gobernar en todo el pa s pero lo nico que har n es ampliar el modelo de corrupci n que prevalece en esta entidad
5479620 los mapaches panistas de guanajuato contribuyeron de manera fraudulenta con 300 mil votos a favor de felipe calder n como lo reconociera el actual secretario de gobierno de la entidad gerardo mosqueta en resumen los panistas de arriba son unos c nicos son unos descarados son m s corruptos que los priistas y se caracterizan por predicar una doble moral aunque su verdadera doctrina es la hipocres a
5479621 ahora que dicen los panistas que este estado lo van a agarrar de ejemplo a nivel nacional la verdad que eso es ofensivo porque el pueblo de guanajuato es un pueblo trabajador y noble un pueblo tan trabajador bueno y honrado como el de guanajuato nada tiene que ver con la camarilla del pan ni con el ratero de vicente fox y su esposa martha sah n
5479622 una cosa es el pueblo de guanajuato y otra la caterva de delincuentes de cuello blanco que se incrustaron en acci n nacional
5479623 lo primero es convencer a los jefes de calder n para que cambien la pol tica econ mica y para que no privatice el petr leo porque de lo contrario habr mayor inseguridad y violencia
5479624 los mexicanos no permitiremos la entrega del petr leo a empresas extranjeras porque sin ese hidrocarburo no se podr sacar adelante al pa s y las nuevas generaciones ser an esclavas en su propia tierra
5479625 si se privatiza el petr leo no habr a recursos suficientes para pagar los sueldos de maestros enfermeras y mucho menos para financiar los programas sociales como procampo y oportunidades

5479673 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

5479675 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5479705 we had the chief justice last year calling for a review of the justice system and we certainly think its timely
5479706 but the lnp will be reserving our judgment on these reforms because they are major reforms that are proposed until we see the detail of the legislation when its introduced into the parliament
5479707 as long as the proposed legislation is confined to exceptional cases so that theres as little erosion of the role of juries as possible it could achieve a worthwhile goal to avoid having to make a choice between running the risk of a person not receiving a fair trial and losing the important opportunity of having serious criminal charges determined
5479708 in controversial trials the only way to deal with recent problems is to allow questioning of jurors
5479709 we support judge only trials subject to seeing the fine print

5479717 every single property has been acquired on a voluntary basis which by definition means that people have made an assessment of their own financial circumstances
5479718 its reasonable to assume that they would not have volunteered to have their property acquired unless overall they were in a much better financial position at the end of it
5479719 this is arguably one of the most generous compensation packages in the states history

5479763 what i can say about forestry is that the commission in charge of setting the minimum export prices for timber has not met since 2000 so the logging companies took advantage of the situation to export timber at a price under its real value it means that the congolese government has suffered losses in terms of foreign currency earnings and taxes

5479823 now at a time when we really are beginning to have some success in our macroeconomic programmes we are beginning to be affected by external factors that are leaving our countries without any fiscal capacity but thats not the only problem the problem is the lack of any real coordinated response from the international financial organizations that are working with us to maintain macro economic stability at any cost
5479824 in 2007 the chinese government purchased 462 billion in u s and other foreign currency and securities and in 2008 it is on track to purchase about 640 billion in foreign currencies this comes to about 17 percent of chinas gdp and about 43 percent of its exports of goods and services in recent weeks china has begun pushing down the value of the yuan and if this continues this will likely have major repercussions for global trade and financial stability in the months ahead
5479825 on july 16 2008 the closest date of the weekly reports to the july 15th low in the dollar index the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets
5479826 it is intended to continue the provision of usd liquidity for as long as the governing council considers it to be needed in view of the prevailing market conditions
5479827 i feel no confidence that countries apart from ourselves and those seated around this table can deal with this problem completely seriously i dont see the americans helping us nor do i see the europeans helping us and in fact on many occasions when they bring programmes for diversification for agricultural production and so on they perpetrate a fraud on people raising expectations and there are many for the small contributions they make
5479828 that boom in oil prices a very important cause it is a tragedy for our countries to give you a figure that i think might help prick the worlds conscience as regards the tragedy we are living through 70 of our exports go to pay the oil bill here practically nothing is left to invest in social programmes or in economic or social development oil is eating up our economies
5479829 i think that if there were a consensus between everyone about what is the reality of oil then oil could not be subject to the volatility of financial bubbles it could not be subject to future prices it could not be subject to countries individual policies because oil has to do with the very life of the planet
