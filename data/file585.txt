5850007 whilst we have no objection to the proposed childrens playground area we are strongly opposed to the idea of concrete lighted bicycle way and further irrigated gardens
5850008 this proposal would not only be a very costly exercise in its development but an added burden to our limited water supply as well as a drag on a power course
5850009 this area is at present a very pleasant nature area enjoyed by all at little or no cost to the council

5850024 something i dont necessarily like about the way that people approach notation in classical music is not that its literal but theres just a lack of imagination you play it then thats it in new music ensembles my favorite part is not playing the rehearsing i really like rehearsing crazy pieces but then you play the concert and usually theres just one and thats it to me thats not very interesting it seems to make a lot more sense and be more alive if you look at notation as something you have to water and it grows in unexpected ways

5850088 i contend that once this court supreme court invalidated the decision not to accept my nomination it follows that the whole process and subsequent election declaration of results and every conduct and juristic act predicated thereon is equally null and void
5850089 i also submit that the settlement talks based on the results of the election are equally an infringement upon my rights as already declared by this court and the constitution of a government based on such results will be itself an infringement of my rights aforesaid

5850301 we will do what it takes we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives
5850302 the as6000 is designed to meet the needs of commercial organizations heavily invested in research and product development for design modeling and visualization
5850303 it includes 20 gbytes of cache per storage shelf with an integrated 10gige switch that doubles the throughput performance per storage shelf to over 600 mbytes s
5850304 we have been working on broadening our products to address some of the pain points felt in manufacturing financial services biotech and other industries
5850305 we believe long term that the entire computing architecture will drive toward more parallelism and that parallel storage will be a prominent part of that new architecture
5850306 many of our competitors offer either nfs network file system or clustered nfs solutions
5850307 nfs can work well if you have a low number of clients and clustered nfs can work as long as you can continue to load balance and avoid the bottlenecks that occur with servers at the middle of the architecture but our direct parallel approach takes the servers out of the equation and creates direct parallel processing between the clients and storage that eliminates 80 90 percent of the need to load balance
5850308 our technology continues to support nfs and nas but we believe that the future is parallelism in it infrastructure and that storage will be an integral part of it
5850309 the as4000 and as6000 products are the newer generations of our as3000 and as5000 product lines and they fall in step with the incorporation of parallel applications by application vendors in the commercial markets we are targeting
5850310 there are many companies with storage offerings for commercial computing that offer nfs and cifs solutions
5850311 these companies include netapp emc isilon ibrix and other some do better in handling large numbers of small files while others excel in handling small numbers of large files
5850312 so if youre a site you have to be aware of the type of problem youre trying to address and who is best positioned to solve it
5850313 of course parallel storage can deliver better performance than nfs or cifs the tradeoff is that its proprietary architecture but if panasas succeeds in getting companies and vendors to make its proprietary code part of their applications this could provide panasas additional traction in commercial markets
5850314 it symbolizes our firm belief that victorys in the classroom that my job and everyone elses job is to support teachers to make our teachers successful
5850315 he wants to be here a long time and we want him here a long time because the principals leadership is key to the success of the school
5850316 from what i hear from the principal we still have somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 students who did not attend or came in late on the first day and we have to do better than that
5850317 it takes up so much valuable teacher time and its unfair to the students
5850318 with our teacher hirings increased and student enrollment we think its a tremendous indicator that people are feeling confident in charleston county schools

5850335 i think theres a chance he can return next week
5850336 hes been running straight ahead and hes doing some cutting now
5850337 conditioning is probably going to be the big thing for him just getting his body back in football shape as he starts to feel comfortable well start to move him in and get him ready its hard to say if hell be back for the first game or two because he hasnt even practiced yet
5850338 between the doctor the trainer and percy there will be a final decision when he returns the only guy that knows his body is percy weve got to keep pushing him to get him ready
5850339 hes still learning the receiver position but thats great hes getting better every day
5850340 he works i appreciate brandon james when he goes out to practice he works when he touches the ball hes got the ability to make people miss he makes things happen in our offense thats what we like to have guys who can take it the distance every time they touch the rock
5850341 hell be fine it will be the weekend until hes back to being cameron newton but hes functioning and he actually played pretty good
5850342 johnnys last five days have been phenomenal he throws it now all the intangibles hes starting to very much improve on its a really good competition right now johnny threw the ball very nice against the no 1 defense
5850343 byran jones did a heck of a job hes lost 20 pounds in 20 days
5850344 t j pridemore he has a chance hell be involved in our goal line offense theres a chance hell play this year ill tell you he cements you when he hits you when he hits the right person he really hits you hard sometimes he hits the wrong person
5850345 i wish he would be a little more advanced right now

5850462 to just say i dont know on the most divisive issue in america is not a clear enough answer for me
5850463 it was a near perfect laboratory test sen obama flunked
5850464 the claim wrongly implies that mccain is proposing a special tax cut for oil companies he is not
5850465 senator obama strongly supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose he believes that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue and he believes that women do not make these decisions casually but wrestle with them in consultation with their doctors pastors and family senator obama understands that some will disagree with him and choose not to support him and he respects those with different opinions but the recent attacks on senator obama that allege he would allow babies born alive to die are outrageous lies the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting there is no room for these kinds of distortions and lies in this campaign what senator obama s attackers don t tell you is that existing illinois law already requires doctors to provide medical care in the very rare case that babies are born alive during abortions they will not tell you that obama voted against these laws in illinois because they were clear attempts to undermine roe v wade they will not tell you that these laws were also opposed by pro choice republicans and the illinois medical society a leading association of doctors in the state and they will not tell you that obama has always maintained that he would have voted for the federal version of this bill which did not pose such a threat the bills senator obama voted against in illinois were crafted to undermine roe v wade or pre existing illinois state law regulating reproductive healthcare and medical practice which is why senator obama objected to them

5850471 the sector will remain in the red in the second half of the fiscal primarily because the airlines not only have to contend with high fuel prices but also with the demand for air travel cooling down compared to last year
5850472 the shares of the listed airline companies like jet airways spicejet and deccan aviation ltd have hit an all time low in august

5850478 the first order of business for our group is to persuade candidates for the presidency senate and house to incorporate a number of womens rights goals and policies into their platforms
5850479 one womens rights issue conspicuously missing from our list abortion
5850480 its not that the new agenda doesnt view choice as a central womens issue its that roe v wade has been used a single defining issue to hold women voters hostage in the past there are many other issues that are important and relevant to a broad spectrum of women
5850481 although several names were put on a to do list chris matthews was our unanimous choice as the worst offender on womens issues therefore the first person on whom we will focus
5850482 its ok ill have plenty of time in the morning

5850490 is it a cool thing to say in this day and age that you love your country and youre fighting for the red white and blue

5850509 i just kinda feel like we as a people need to stop putting up fronts and hiding behind facades no one benefits from it
5850510 amen lol but in all seriousness i really do agree with you we live in a society obsessed with trying to appear to have the perfect life thats all the media feeds us and unless we have a discerning palate then all we wind up consuming is junk food some how believing that is fine dining because it looks and taste so good its why marriage to far too many is no longer sacred why people die on operating tables trying to upgrade from a b to a c cup why there would be no photography at least not professionally without photoshop why more little boys of color want to be rappers than school teachers scientists fathers doctors community world leaders real and honest doesnt mix well with superficial and materialistic and thats what we are conditioned to be if this is what you are driven by and how you live your life you will never truly be happy not possible im just trying to be the bet me that i can be faults and all all i want is to be happy and the get most that i can out of life by living with purpose and giving sharing with others

5850554 if todd wanted to come to manly after 2009 it could only be as a second tier player on a minimum of 50 000
5850555 after 2009 we have back ended contracts that take up too much under the cap for us to sign a player who is worth 400 000 a year todd carney is not on our radar

5850579 scotland has moved on the constituency has moved on and i have moved on
5850580 i feel i have assumed a new role in public life which allows me to work in a number of ways for the future of scotland
5850581 i believe i can be of value to scotland and the labour party from a position outwith elected service
5850582 these are challenging times but despite recent setbacks i am confident glenrothes remains a winnable seat for labour

5850584 i s a contract provision requiring an employee to release
5850585 a contract provision releasing any and all claims does not encompass nonwaivable statutory protections such as the employee indemnity protection of labor code section 2802 and accordingly is not void under labor code section 2804
5850586 as the court of appeal observed andersens actions suggest a possible purpose of misleading employees into thinking they had waived rights that could not be waived thereby minimizing the number of indemnity claims these employees might bring against andersen

5850589 one thing personalities can do is reach beyond the usual political crowd and draw in people who would not have bothered talking about politics before
5850590 they have to be very careful because if they keep going on about politics and if they have made their money from say music there is a danger that they will lose some of their existing fan base simply by going on about it so much
5850591 the soap opera of politics is always of consuming interest its of consuming interest to journalists let alone the rest of the public to that extent it dominates on a day to day basis
5850592 on occasion we get key issues that really do begin to engage the wider public the demonstrations over iraq were an obvious example but it is easier for a large section of the population to be informed by their reaction to brown and blair than by schedule 5 sub clause 2 of the boring regulations of 2006
5850593 it is however crucial that they have the potential to get involved when they want to to put pressure on the government and to vote them out when they want to at election time
5850594 but most of the time it is only a small number of people who are really interested
5850595 these political junkies are essential to any democratic process but the only hope of widening the interest in politics is if they bring along somebody else to an event and they start thinking more deeply about politics
5850596 at the end of the day we have to be realistic about festivals of this sort they are not going to transform our politics and we should not expect them to we should though give them credit for trying
5850597 these conditions indica advertisement te the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the partys ability to continue as a going concern
5850598 the partys auditors have confirmed that the party is indeed a going concern the deficit of 22 000 occurred in a double election year when the demands of the partys campaign operation were significantly high
5850599 this is an entirely manageable deficit which the partys bankers have confirmed they will support
5850600 the scottish liberal democrats are already taking steps to improve our long term income position
5850601 the only way we can do this is by offering distinctive policies choice and image that people can buy into both in terms of membership and party donations
5850602 we need to put this in perspective its not a major problem but it would be better if our books balanced on the right side rather than the wrong one
5850603 not only are polls showing that the scottish liberal democrat leadership contenders are invisible to the public but it looks like the eventual successor to nicol stephen may even inherit an invisible party
5850604 it further underlines the blunder they made in taking to the back benches in a huff after last years holyrood election
5850605 the point is we have a lot more money coming in and assets to cover our debt

5850626 insurgents mounted two of the biggest attacks in years on western forces in afghanistan killing 10 french soldiers in a mountain ambush
5850627 more than 100 000 households or at least 15 of the households relying solely on over the air signals for television
5850628 as part of our efforts to prepare consumers for the transition we have identified television markets in which the largest number of viewers will have to take action to be prepared for the transition six months from now
5850629 this unprecedented nationwide tour by the entire commission is part of our commitment to prepare and educate consumers about the digital television transition
5850630 the global economic downturn is affecting economies across the world and clearly scotland cannot be fully insulated from its effects
5850631 but there are two reasons why the economic outlook for scotland is positive
5850632 first the scottish economy continues to show encouraging signs of resilience second scotland has a government that despite its limited economic powers will take decisive action to strengthen our performance and prospects
5850633 we will not simply sit back and wait for conditions to get better
5850634 that is why we have published the next steps for our housing policy and why up to 100 million capital spending will be brought forward to support these efforts and help us meet demand for affordable housing
5850635 as part of the full programme we are announcing to meet the immediate economic challenges promote growth and support business confidence this investment will help us maintain scotlands reputation as europes place of the future
5850636 the snps credit is low after disappointing first time buyers by failing to deliver on its promise to provide 2 000 grants and now deliberately setting out to mislead the public that they are providing new money
5850637 while the sfha believes there should be more funding overall for housing we welcome the scottish governments decision to bring forward the allocated funding and give a key role to housing associations
5850638 this gives local authorities greater flexibility and recognises that housing associations are best placed to meet the needs of the affordable housing sector
5850639 this is important at a time when demand for affordable housing options is likely to increase as the credit crunch increasingly hits consumers and mortgage lending
5850640 t he dirty little secret among employers and hr departments is that classifying employees as exempt even if it means breaking the law is in their best interest provided of course that they dont get caught
5850641 i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5850642 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5850643 if we think that we can use the same partisan politics where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5850644 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5850645 his hands legs were amputated and his head was decapitated
5850646 there are the bloodstains on the wall and here it is dried on the floor
5850647 and here a womans shoes she was a victim of the militia we found her corpse in the grave
5850648 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5850649 we want to ensure that everyone who uses relies on or has any concern with post office services is both fully aware of the proposed changes and able to give views on them
5850650 labour in edinburgh cannot now cry crocodile tears for the loss of post offices they voted to axe
5850651 scottish labour mps have consistently backed the uk governments policy which has led to these closures so it is a bit rich that they are now feigning outrage and concern
5850652 myself and my colleagues are determined to fight these changes that will effectively butcher postal services across the region
5850653 our experiences show that regardless of how good an argument you put forward the decisions have been made you may save one post office but another will be closed down the road
5850654 i do regret it when people say that consultations are futile because my evidence is that they are not
5850655 a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5850656 this is the clintons were talking about she can triangulate the three teams
5850657 we filed our original opinion on february 28 2008 granting the petition on the bases that 1 california statutory law does not permit home schooling and 2 this prohibition does not violate the u s constitution

5850665 some people dont have that sense of humor im one of them
5850666 unequivocal commitment to good neighbourly relations and resolve outstanding border disputes
5850667 similarly most turks of today think it is fine to ethnically cleanse greek cypriots and take their lands because greek cypriots are
5850668 unequivocal commitment to good neighbourly relations and resolve outstanding border disputes
5850669 we are hugely disappointed that the match will be played at a neutral venue
5850670 it was a crucial qualifier because it will be our first and we worked very hard at the fixtures meeting
5850671 but we have a bigger situation at home and it wont matter where we play the players will use this as a bigger motivation against ireland to get a result
5850672 let me forge a sharp weapon for you and use it against me
5850673 but why are you doing this isnt this going to be a bitter taste in your mouth
5850674 unequivocal commitment to good neighbourly relations and resolve outstanding border disputes
5850675 whereas if they had had any wisdom they would have repelled that motive earlier since
5850676 one of the most reliable sources of scathing rebuttal to the left wing media has become known for its humorous but biting style his regular verbal assault on labour ministers has quite a reputation
5850677 we like mr eugenides we highly recommend adding him to your blogroll go and read it is absolutely the most glorious stuff
5850678 oh boy i think reading you and devils kitchen is going to damage my psyche what a joy
5850679 the most amusing non stop critique of the labour government available
5850680 my favorite anglo rage boy the best apoplectic brit blogger
5850681 a widely acknowledged political genius of the first order still he finds time to visit greece sink a pint or two and take on the idiots who purport to govern our fair land
5850682 there really is no purpose to be served by following humbly in the wake of the genius of mr eugenides why seek to improve on perfection when one knows in advance that one will fail
5850683 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise
5850684 i rather enjoyed the retort of the blogger known as mr eugenides
5850685 current population growth is alarming and killing efforts to combat poverty
5850686 you cant keep going with a completely upside down age distribution with the pyramid standing on its point you cant have a country where everyone lives in a nursing home
5850687 whether its older ladies or middle aged women or young girls the show reached a lot of people
5850688 i think theres the start of a chemistry but it takes time to develop that
5850689 the more you can play together the better that chemistry is the biggest thing is i think were similar in a lot of ways i think we can both bring the pressure off the edges
5850690 which guy do you slide to which guy do you chip how are you going to chip only one of them
5850691 really if you look at andre hes got to be excited because he has been chipped most of the year in the past
5850692 well come off the field and ill tell him whats going on my side hell tell me whats going on on his side
5850693 this last game i told andre he could beat the guy inside he was telling me what jets tackle dbrickashaw ferguson was doing over there you share that knowledge so throughout the game youll know what to expect when you get over there
5850694 i think people get the idea of being a leader a little messed up
5850695 a leader just doesnt come in and start saying things and breaking chalkboards and throwing bottles around the locker room it starts with your play im not a big rah rah guy thats high school stuff the pregame talks and win one for the gipper id rather go out there and play hard and show them the way to do it there comes a time where you have to stand up and grab someone by the face mask and get things going and that just comes naturally i think when you talk too much you lose credibility when you do the right thing your words carry a lot more weight
5850696 when you know what youre doing and youre confident in what youre doing and you prepare yourself you can be relaxed and kind of kick butt when you have to we cant walk around the street sacking people in the grocery store and being jerks youve got to be personable but on sundays we can turn it on and get it done
5850697 its a day at a time in this league life is so short so im going to enjoy this media session and go get ready to practice and enjoy that and hopefully see you tomorrow

5850707 i like the way he handles a broad range of subjects in an engaging and friendly manner definitely one of the good guys
5850708 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
5850709 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
5850710 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
5850711 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth
5850712 the art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups
5850713 a human being should be able to change a diaper plan an invasion butcher a hog conn a ship design a building write a sonnet balance accounts build a wall set a bone comfort the dying take orders give orders cooperate act alone solve equations analyze a new problem pitch manure program a computer cook a tasty meal fight efficiently die gallantly specialization is for insects
5850714 in the progress of the division of labour the employment of the far greater part of those who live by labour that is of the great body of the people comes to be confined to a few very simple operations frequently to one or two but the understandings of the greater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments the man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations of which the effects are perhaps always the same or very nearly the same has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur he naturally loses therefore the habit of such exertion and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become the torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation but of conceiving any generous noble or tender sentiment and consequently of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life
5850715 im a consumer advocate this is the kind of stuff i love
5850716 dealalerter takes comparison shopping to the next level it lets the internet do some of the work for you
5850717 there has been an impressive increase in recycling of domestic waste in the last few years but that only represents a tiny fraction of all waste generated in the uk
5850718 it is time for the government to move its priorities from household waste to the far greater problem of industrial and commercial waste
5850719 we would also like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
5850720 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway culture we currently have
5850721 the combination of weaker growth and higher inflation suggests that the voting could be split three ways again at the august meeting
5850722 however the dovish tone of the inflation report makes it likely that more members will have voted for a rate cut than a hike
5850723 boe policy rates remain restrictive versus current and expected domestic demand conditions
5850724 it is reasonable to expect greater easing action over the medium term than what is currently priced into the yield curves
5850725 this spiral has to be nipped in the bud and that means having interest rates at a suitable level until the threat of higher inflation has passed
5850726 is that an elephant or a hippo running down the sidewalk
5850727 i think that thunder oh no its just that wheezy red faced slob running hope she has earthquake insurance
5850728 random house made the decision to cancel its us publication of the novel the jewel of medina after much deliberation and with great reluctance
5850729 the decision was based on advice from scholars of islam among several creditable sources that publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community and could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5850730 firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some
5850731 micahs was an impressive performance but i was most pleased with his attitude after stepping down from the seniors
5850732 when micah first broke in at manchester city he was a constant goal threat so it was nice to see him score hes quite frightening to play against and he played well tonight hes a talent
5850733 lets consider the tesco launch in isolation for a moment you only have to cast your mind back a few years to see the devastating impact retail price wars have on farmers margins
5850734 tesco denies that this move will have any impact on the farmers supplying milk through its sustainable dairy group tsdg and in the short term that may be the case but more concerning is the impact this move will have on farmers confidence and the prospects of a price increase this autumn
5850735 the tsdg is still in its infancy and the launch of a tertiary brand of milk albeit at the expense of tescos own margin sends out the wrong message to farmers who are still adjusting to being in a relationship with a retailer for now at least it would seem that the core tsdg farmers are insulated from the fallout of any price war purely because of the strength of their contract with tesco however not all farmers can say the same
5850736 as was expected tescos competitive advantage lasted all of 24 hours as the other retailers reacted in a tidal wave of ruthless discounting
5850737 not only does this create a difficult climate for negotiating autumn milk price increases in the longer term retailers have a finite ability to take a hit on their margins and the ability of the discounters to sell milk at below the cost of production and absorb these costs will be weaker than that of the big four we know from bitter experience where theyll come looking for cuts in the long run
5850738 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
5850739 hi guys im the theme author and cant find any record of them paying for the theme im not sure at this point what my options are but im looking into it
5850740 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
5850741 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
5850742 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
5850743 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
5850744 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
5850745 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
5850746 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
5850747 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
5850748 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
5850749 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
5850750 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
5850751 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
5850752 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
5850753 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
5850754 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
5850755 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
5850756 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
5850757 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
5850758 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
5850759 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
5850760 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
5850761 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
5850762 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
5850763 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
5850764 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
5850765 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
5850766 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
5850767 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
5850768 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
5850769 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
5850770 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

5850782 the commitee remains concerned that the state party the uk has continued its practice of detaining large numbers of asylum seekers including children furthermore the committee reiterates that it considers unacceptable any detention of asylum seekers in prisons and is concerned that while most asylum seekers are detained in immigration centres a small minority of them continue to be held in prisons allegedly for reasons of security and control it is concerned that some asylum seekers do not have early access to legal representation and are thus likely to be unaware of their right to make a bail application which is no longer automatic since the enactment of the nationality immigraition and asylum act 2002 the committee is also concerned by the failure to keep statistics on persons subject to deportation who are removed from northern ireland to great britain as well as their temporary detention in police cells
5850783 in particular while it the committee is disturbed by the extension of the maximum period of detention without charge of terrorist suspects under the terrorism act 2006 from 14 days to 28 days it is even more disturbed by the proposed extension of this maximum period of detention under the counter terrorism bill from 28 days to 42 days

5850818 negative symptoms of schizophrenia are not adequately addressed by available treatments for schizophrenia thus it is reasonable to consider them as a target for a drug claim this article describes the thought process that the food and drug administration fda will undertake in considering negative symptoms of schizophrenia as a novel and distinct drug target beyond this basic question this article identifies a number of design issues that the fda needs to consider regarding how best to conduct studies to support claims for this target these design issues include 1 what population to study 2 what phase of illness to target 3 whether to focus on the negative symptom domain overall or on some specific aspect of negative symptoms 4 the role of functional measures in negative symptom trials and 5 optimal designs for targeting drugs for add on therapy or broad spectrum agents

5850821 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5850822 throughout his long career congressman allen has supported fairness and equality while opposing discrimination his voting record on lgbt issues is exceptional he has worked to eliminate discrimination in jobs housing public accommodations and financial matters and we look forward to working with him to win fully inclusive federal employment non discrimination legislation
5850823 we literally generated whole tubes in the lab from scratch
5850824 the beautiful thing is that you start with one line expand them indefinitely and generate as many as you want
5850825 at this stage the work is very promising but has not progressed to the stage where the cultured cells are fully equivalent
5850826 much more work will yet be needed before this becomes a practical reality
5850827 the ethics are potentially problematic as embryonic stem cells ultimately originate in an embryo that is destroyed during their harvest a process that some religious conservatives equate with murder
5850828 ive never met the pro lifer that was both anti war and anti death penalty
5850829 you know ive never met the pro lifer that was both anti war and anti death penalty
5850830 everyone knows what savior means die to save others and siblings is nothing but an acknowledgment that they are in fact human beings
5850831 orly you mentioned social and economic problems with bearing an unwanted child are you perhaps talking about yourself please do not call others unwanted unless you speak of yourself
5850832 laura yes because killing an innocent baby aka fetus is not equivalent to killing a murderer and im not sure why you lumped war into your misguided statement it is in no way related
5850833 since you must have the numbers what is the cost per year of the war in iraq compared to the sum of all the federal governments welfare services
5850834 orly you mentioned social and economic problems with bearing an unwanted child are you perhaps talking about yourself please do not call others unwanted unless you speak of yourself who is unwanted and who is a a weight on the tax system

5850845 immortal army of one is one of my personal favorites on
5850846 its already mutating the animals the pollution that theyre causing we need to do something quickly
5850847 for me personally it does piss me off you know knowing that its not under my control right now its the government of canada that has the control over it they have monopoly over our land but industry somehow they got the licence to pollute
5850848 i think joe biden brings some great experience to the table
5850849 the guy who i thought at this point would be best but probably will not do it is jim webb
5850850 who do you think its going to be well last week i would have said evan bayh
5850851 my number one choice for vice president the last little while has been kathleen sebelius
5850852 i would support hillary i would have supported her if she had won the nomination
5850853 i dont think theres any chance of it but yeah i would be great with it
5850854 i wouldnt give it a 50 50 but i certainly wouldnt rule it out

5850856 there is still a lot of work to do before this city is fully recovered
5850857 and for people who are still hurting and not yet back in their homes a brighter day might seem impossible yet a brighter day is coming and it is heralded by hopeful signs of progress
5850858 its defined him a great deal in the publics mind
5850859 that along with the war in iraq are really the pivotal events in his political demise
5850860 first impressions have ways of becoming lasting ones and certainly that was the case with katrina
5850861 its not the quantity of the visits its the quality of the visits
5850862 more like a supercharged comptrollers office than a supercharged recovery office
5850863 if its left abandoned certainly that isnt helpful to the redevelopment of either of those heavily damaged neighborhoods that surround it
5850864 we forecast a further near term rise in essential price inflation and qualitatively we see this as a risk that inflation expectations will remain at elevated levels through q4

5850866 gloomy market conditions have not dampened consumers appetite for shopping online online sales continue to show strong growth particularly when compared to the tough trading conditions on the high street
5850867 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
5850868 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
5850869 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5850870 i think its inexcusable not to have a budget yet
5850871 i recommend everyone to stay here until we have a budget and not for anyone to leave
5850872 i think its important for everyone to recognize that we need to compromise here
5850873 everyone can get stuck in their ideology you know theres democrats and republicans they all have their ideology i totally understand it but i think we all have to give in order to make this happen

5850889 they must not be very busy to have time to patrol san fran ferndale i guess the young man deserves a ticket anyway he turned left where he wasnt supposed to poor state trooper he may not have a job come monday
5850890 i think hes training that woman in the car with him she doesnt seem to have on a uniform perhaps the state cant afford to buy her one tsk tsk
5850891 you are not playing fair we have asked you to share and let others get a chance to ask questions you shouldnt be snatching all the best you know that

5850898 damn things suck particularly my finances the bush administration and its cronies have damn near wrecked the country by spending all this money on that dumb war which they lied about to get us over there and they want more of it with iran theyre probably lying about that too they need to go their policies stink and have gotten us in this fucking debt hole with the chinese and not to mention the shitty oil countries might as well buy milk to drive your car same goddamn price per gallon and its hard to afford either
5850899 mccain is a grumpy old man who doesnt mind killing the children you send to iraq to protect his oil buddies he doesnt mind doing it at all and that makes me sick
5850900 yeah look where bush and your so called experience got us in the toilet buddy and everybody knows it
5850901 as you probably know climate scientists dont blame all hurricanes on global warming but they do link the increased number of severe hurricanes on climate related factors
5850902 glenn is at a good age and is years away from his peak
5850903 what we have got to do is prepare him for his peak get him ready to play at this level and to do well in the champions league
5850904 but we have a certain amount of money and this gives us a chance to develop our own players thats exciting and is good for us speaking to him he does want to get better so it looks good for us we have to try and get the best of what we can of raw materials and make them better
5850905 glenn likes to defend hes got good stature and good pace
5850906 we got close to him in julys algarve cup tournament in portugal and we realised hes vocal as well he likes to be part of the defensive unit theres plenty there to work with
5850907 ive come here and i want to play so its up to me now to do well and give the manager a problem
5850908 i spoke to a few people and they all had great stories about celtic so i only expect the best i spoke to jan vennegoor of hesselink and also to former celtic player pierre van hooijdonk and he told me a few stories about celtic i only heard great stories so i cant wait to get started
5850909 my main area is centre half and that is my best position its a big step forward for me celtic play for medals they play in the champions league and i only see this as a big step forward in my career
5850910 what were trying to do is develop as a group here to be ready to play at any time
5850911 well have a group of centre halves a group of full backs and i do not have a set team in my mind
5850912 i have a set way of playing in my mind and whoevers face fits the bill for that week or month or year will play theres no doubt about that we have a group that are around the same age and will be learning at the same time
5850913 in the beginning there was only rangers but in the end celtic were the club i wanted to play for and lets focus on them now
5850914 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
5850915 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
5850916 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
5850917 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
5850918 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on perceiving beauty in the environment
5850919 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
5850920 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
5850921 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab
5850922 when he first came here he weighed about 35 pounds and had that old winter hair he was lethargic and weak

5850942 its always nice to get off the season under way with a win
5850943 i think we are fully aware of the fact we didnt play to our best but the important thing is to get off to a good start with three points away from home
5850944 winning isnt all that matters but its important that you start the season well and finish it well we need to improve in all areas and thats what we are about anyway making sure we improve on a daily basis
5850945 we know we arent firing on all cylinders just yet but it was just nice to get off to a win particularly away from home
5850946 we all want to hit the ground running and you can do no better than to get off to a win but with liverpool being liverpool we are perfectionists we are never happy whether its 1 0 3 0 4 0 and well certainly be looking to improve in the coming days
5850947 my ipod broke it started freezing up all the time and not working
5850948 the post office confirmed with me that it was delivered

5850952 chelsea football club is pleased with the verdict of the employment tribunal in the case brought against us by paul smith the key parts of the case were all found unanimously in our favour
5850953 chelsea had prior to the tribunal agreed to accept a finding of unfair dismissal and to pay full compensation for this to paul smith to take the case further was unnecessary and based on little evidence as demonstrated by the outcome chelsea will abide fully with the findings of the tribunal
5850954 chelsea has already admitted to dismissing me unfairly and i am pleased that my costs of that part of the claim have been awarded against chelsea whilst the judgment was not wholly positive for me i am pleased that the tribunal rejected kenyons evidence that no agreement was reached in february 2007

5850959 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
5850960 i knew i had to get out of the water so climbed onto my board and started paddling toward shore calling out to my mates ryan welsh and dan healey
5850961 ryan didnt help much he took one look at me and spun away
5850962 he told me he couldnt look at me or he would spew
5850963 and then he said i dont think you have an eye
5850964 i saw blood streaming down my face and ryan and dan ran to get help from ryans dad chris who lives across the road from narrawallee beach
5850965 the scariest moment was when i saw my reflection in the car window
5850966 i will have to massage around my eye and they reckon it will take a few months before i can control the muscles in my eyelid and be able to open my eye

5850972 no one from russia believed it was possible to bring 18 players out with us from a war torn country the president asked me to come out with these players he told me that the result wasnt important this game is simply to show russia that you can bomb us and you can send tanks into our country but you will never stop our people this is a symbol that they will not defeat us
5850973 there was a war going on in some of the places they travelled from
5850974 these players deserve big respect theyve risked their lives to get here we spent 20 hours on a coach from tbilisi travelling to azerbaijan to catch a flight the risk was high for everyone the biggest problem was on the border because azerbaijan would not let us in i cannot talk about the reasons for that but compliments to the azerbaijan football federation they helped us
5850975 its hard for us to play and think about football with what is happening in georgia
5850976 my family are ok but some young boys who are my friends are still in hospital they are in the army and were fighting against russia two of my best friends who have been in the army for three years tried to protect georgia but there were too many russians
5850977 theyve seen the stuff what happened what they have told me the last two days was a surprise because when you watched tv they didnt show too many bad things they said 2 000 soldiers were killed but i think it was twice as many what has happened in georgia without question they have killed too many kids under 10 years they dont care where they put the bomb so you never know who is in the house
5850978 the 11th of august was the worst night because everyone thought the russians were going to arrive in tbilisi and kill everyone i think under this situation you can understand that football was not important
5850979 we beat the russian under 21 side 2 0 in georgia eight months ago
5850980 at the worst time of the war they sent us a fax saying that it was fine for us to come and play a friendly against them on september 5 i sent them one back saying that wed be there we are a country of 4 5 million people russia is a country of 120 million we have no chance of beating them in a war but its eleven versus eleven out there we have a chance to beat them on the ground

5850984 the consequence may demoralize you but its not will power
5850985 its not a psychological problem its a major physiological force coming from within your brain and body to eat at night so inappropriately
5850986 they can get up they see their environment they know where the kitchen is but they have no judgment no inhibition and thats the problem
5850987 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
5850988 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
5850989 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
5850990 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
5850991 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
5850992 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients
5850993 an emergency meeting of the regional development committee was told independent consultants would examine what had happened
5850994 no doubt the culvert did its job it was designed and built exactly in accordance with specifications and put into practice
5850995 but unfortunately you cant countenance for severe weather conditions like this
5850996 it had been through the whole process of checking rivers agency were happy with it we were happy with it and the roads service were happy with the design we put forward or else nobody would have signed on it nobody anticipated the amount of rain we had and i dont think the finger pointing is going to help we just have to see how we are going to get over this problem and prevent it in the future
5850997 the decision to realign the clowney river to the south of the underpass rather than integrate it into the roof slab has been a major factor in allowing us to reprogramme the work to finish this part early this allowed us to deal more efficiently with numerous overhead and underground services and keep traffic running during the construction
5850998 the chinese boxer other finalist zou shiming beat barnes convincingly in the world championships in chicago last year
5850999 the notion that christianity in general and evangelicalism in particular are by nature right wing creeds has always been wrong how can a faith built around a commitment to the poor and the vulnerable be seen as leading ineluctably to conservative political conclusions
5851000 it was mccains night obama made no big mistakes but his tendency to somewhat windy generalities meant he wasnt particularly compelling mccain who went second was crisp by contrast and his anecdotes colorful
5851001 members of the orange order belong to the institution because they are firmly committed to their reformed protestant faith and in a world where secular values are changing the societies in which we live our faith is important to us
5851002 they might think they are being smart issuing that type of answer but it is showing that they are burying their heads in the sand many members have been very positive about the suggestion internally but nothing has happened at an official level yet
5851003 were a pro protestant organisation not an anti catholic one were an all ireland body and we have members in nine counties in the republic
5851004 the biennial pew research center report on changing news audiences describes 13 of the us public as
5851005 remarkably at a time when nearly all newspapers are losing sales and celebrity and mens magazines are reporting significant circulation losses the cerebral weeklies and monthlies continue to grow in the first half of this year the circulation of the oldie climbed 15 5 per cent to 28 862 compared with the same period last year the spectator rose 5 1 per cent to 76 952 the uk sale of the economist grew by 5 6 per cent year on year to 182 539 the week was up 4 5 per cent at 150 099 and prospects circulation rose 10 7 per cent to 27 552
5851006 to bang on too much about the internet as the distinguishing factor between newspapers and magazines seems to me rather dangerous
5851007 is it good value for money only 33 of those surveyed agreed that it was and some 47 disagreed with 28 disagreeing strongly does the licence fee ensure provision of programming not available elsewhere not according to a clear majority of those expressing a view 41 and perhaps most worrying of all is it an appropriate way of funding the bbc only just over half of those polled and expressing a view thought it was

5851009 it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply
5851010 for me it looks as if it came from old stocks
5851011 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
5851012 it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
5851013 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
5851014 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
5851015 but when it semtex was passed over to different groups how it came to be in their possession i dont know at this point in time
5851016 bid to exert control in nationalist areas in particular is continuing unabated
5851017 in the decade up to 2006 residential property prices in ireland rose more rapidly than in any other developed economy strong demand partly explains this incomes employment and population all grew robustly the increase in the supply of new housing was just as phenomenal the number of annual housing completions in 2006 was almost five times that of the early 1990s which compares with static output in the euro area and in the uk however when supply and demand fundamentals are considered in tandem the enormous increase in prices was unjustified consequently the countrys property market is now going sharply into reverse prices have been falling for 18 months and excess supply makes further declines all but inevitable in the event of an even sharper correction than is currently predicted the main lenders would probably suffer badly although irelands banks have been highly profitable over a long period and are thus well capitalised they are hugely exposed to the domestic property market the international credit crisis should it continue could cause serious financing problems for the banks adding to concerns about their balance sheets
5851018 the outlook for household spending growth in northern ireland is looking more subdued now than at any time since the early 1990s

5851020 it reflected the engineering influence of william thomson instead of edward whitehouse and it would not fail the way the whitehouse cable had
5851021 an emergency meeting has taken place at stormont between ministers and relevant agencies in the aftermath of saturdays flooding
5851022 those affected could expect to receive around 1 000 in compensation but the figure has yet to be finalised councils will be notified of the scheme on monday so that people will be able to make applications
5851023 the relevant agencies met on friday after receiving weather warnings as a result northern ireland water was able to deploy resources and contractors throughout the event and around the clock
5851024 she was getting on it and she sees the car and she jumped to the other side
5851025 when she saw the bike she thought how is she going to get around
5851026 that bike isnt going to be usable but this one will be
5851027 its things like this that really touch you and make you feel good about what you do and how you serve the community
5851028 there has been an impressive increase in recycling of domestic waste in the last few years but that only represents a tiny fraction of all waste generated in the uk
5851029 it is time for the government to move its priorities from household waste to the far greater problem of industrial and commercial waste
5851030 we would also like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
5851031 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway culture we currently have
5851032 ladies if youre hard up move to the frozen tundra you might get laid
5851033 gsa welcomes the opportunity to work with the vet force and other organizations committed to helping veterans and service disabled veterans who are entrepreneurs
5851034 i am not worried you have to give them time he is 19 years old
5851035 theo is not yet completely there but he can make decisions in big games that will always be his strength he is a boy who will always make progress because he is intelligent and he knows where he wants to get and that is why i believe you have to patient with him
5851036 i believe that when everyone is sharp we will have much more invention
5851037 but of course you always want a player like f bregas to be in there because he gives you the quality of the pass
5851038 what sort of moloch is this that kills its children
5851039 we are always going to be seen as little unfashionable wigan but i know i have some really good players
5851040 we have done very well to tie up some of our best players to long term deals especially wilson palacios wilson has the ability to go to the top
5851041 last season he was linked with manchester united i dont know if there was interest but it was speculated on because of my past links
5851042 we worked hard to tie him down and sign a new contract
5851043 he knows this year is a big one for him and it is going to be hard
5851044 but he wanted to stay here and it would take an amazing offer to get him off us bearing in mind some of the fees being paid out for some players at the moment
5851045 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
5851046 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
5851047 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
5851048 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
5851049 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
5851050 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients
5851051 an emergency meeting of the regional development committee was told independent consultants would examine what had happened
5851052 no doubt the culvert did its job it was designed and built exactly in accordance with specifications and put into practice
5851053 but unfortunately you cant countenance for severe weather conditions like this
5851054 it had been through the whole process of checking rivers agency were happy with it we were happy with it and the roads service were happy with the design we put forward or else nobody would have signed on it nobody anticipated the amount of rain we had and i dont think the finger pointing is going to help we just have to see how we are going to get over this problem and prevent it in the future
5851055 the decision to realign the clowney river to the south of the underpass rather than integrate it into the roof slab has been a major factor in allowing us to reprogramme the work to finish this part early this allowed us to deal more efficiently with numerous overhead and underground services and keep traffic running during the construction
5851056 the chinese boxer other finalist zou shiming beat barnes convincingly in the world championships in chicago last year
5851057 the notion that christianity in general and evangelicalism in particular are by nature right wing creeds has always been wrong how can a faith built around a commitment to the poor and the vulnerable be seen as leading ineluctably to conservative political conclusions
5851058 it was mccains night obama made no big mistakes but his tendency to somewhat windy generalities meant he wasnt particularly compelling mccain who went second was crisp by contrast and his anecdotes colorful
5851059 members of the orange order belong to the institution because they are firmly committed to their reformed protestant faith and in a world where secular values are changing the societies in which we live our faith is important to us
5851060 they might think they are being smart issuing that type of answer but it is showing that they are burying their heads in the sand many members have been very positive about the suggestion internally but nothing has happened at an official level yet
5851061 were a pro protestant organisation not an anti catholic one were an all ireland body and we have members in nine counties in the republic
5851062 the biennial pew research center report on changing news audiences describes 13 of the us public as
5851063 remarkably at a time when nearly all newspapers are losing sales and celebrity and mens magazines are reporting significant circulation losses the cerebral weeklies and monthlies continue to grow in the first half of this year the circulation of the oldie climbed 15 5 per cent to 28 862 compared with the same period last year the spectator rose 5 1 per cent to 76 952 the uk sale of the economist grew by 5 6 per cent year on year to 182 539 the week was up 4 5 per cent at 150 099 and prospects circulation rose 10 7 per cent to 27 552
5851064 to bang on too much about the internet as the distinguishing factor between newspapers and magazines seems to me rather dangerous
5851065 is it good value for money only 33 of those surveyed agreed that it was and some 47 disagreed with 28 disagreeing strongly does the licence fee ensure provision of programming not available elsewhere not according to a clear majority of those expressing a view 41 and perhaps most worrying of all is it an appropriate way of funding the bbc only just over half of those polled and expressing a view thought it was
5851066 the growing threat from swarms of jellyfish around britains coast i
5851067 it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply
5851068 for me it looks as if it came from old stocks
5851069 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
5851070 it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
5851071 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
5851072 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
5851073 but when it semtex was passed over to different groups how it came to be in their possession i dont know at this point in time
5851074 bid to exert control in nationalist areas in particular is continuing unabated
5851075 in the decade up to 2006 residential property prices in ireland rose more rapidly than in any other developed economy strong demand partly explains this incomes employment and population all grew robustly the increase in the supply of new housing was just as phenomenal the number of annual housing completions in 2006 was almost five times that of the early 1990s which compares with static output in the euro area and in the uk however when supply and demand fundamentals are considered in tandem the enormous increase in prices was unjustified consequently the countrys property market is now going sharply into reverse prices have been falling for 18 months and excess supply makes further declines all but inevitable in the event of an even sharper correction than is currently predicted the main lenders would probably suffer badly although irelands banks have been highly profitable over a long period and are thus well capitalised they are hugely exposed to the domestic property market the international credit crisis should it continue could cause serious financing problems for the banks adding to concerns about their balance sheets

5851081 the relevant agencies met on friday after receiving weather warnings as a result northern ireland water was able to deploy resources and contractors throughout the event and around the clock
5851082 i always entertained the idea of moving to the jervis bay area and im thrilled that i now have this opportunity i look forward to meeting and working with stakeholders and the community and of course continuing the good work already started in the area of marine education
5851083 im very concerned that we should be responsible in how we use marine resources and marine parks have been a chosen career path for me for some time now
5851084 a lot of attention is quite rightly on climate change right now and i see marine parks as an insurance policy against the effects of climate change
5851085 it is important that we increase the marine environments ability to withstand the climate change impacts that are ahead
5851086 ensuring the health of the marine environment is the most positive thing we can do
5851087 well since you know about it i guess you can come
5851088 we want you to come but somehow it wasnt stated directly to you
5851089 everyone forgets ryan is still a young lad thats why he went to the olympics and if he adapts to the premier league i think he can be one of the best players in it hes got everything
5851090 he is quick strong and has got loads of ability i know him as a person and he wants to get better and better and show everyone in england what he can bring to the team
5851091 i havent played james and kenny together before but i know they are capable of combining well
5851092 more of an attacking style means utilising james mcfadden in the right way we have more options now going forward if it works well against northern ireland we will use it against macedonia
5851093 an extra goal or two from midfield could make all the difference to world cup qualification
5851094 with him being at united with the squad they have got you can understand darren not playing every game
5851095 he has handled it very well his game has not suffered and he is an outstanding talent he is one of my first picks because of his ability
5851096 he has chipped a bone and has already had a months rest ill give him every possibility and he is a fit lad we would have to make sure he is fit he is a top player for us and we would hang out until the last possible moment for him
5851097 apart from david healy steven has been our most influential player
5851098 to be honest i dont know why he cant get into the fulham side if the move comes off he will be a fantastic acquisition for rangers
5851099 i have previously advised liverpool over two danes with daniel agger and nicola savic both of whom they purchased and are almost too happy with
5851100 i gave them mathias jorgensens name a long time ago and liverpool are wild about him they are keeping very good track of him
5851101 liverpool see him as a very promising youngster like i do and clearly just like a player who will play for the danish national team for many years to come
5851102 the captain cannot play if he is limping of course but the fact someone is captain does not make him undroppable
5851103 john will be the driver of this team it was important for me to get to know the players and then choose who the captain would be rio will be the vice captain and john will not be sure to play but for me the first xi are always the best players at that moment for me
5851104 i was actually standing next to rio when the manager told us after training
5851105 the first thing rio did was turn to me and shake my hand and thats a measure of the kind of guy he is
5851106 captaining the team against the united states and scoring just after the european cup final might have shown the manager what kind of character i am to bounce back after such a huge disappointment for myself maybe persuaded him i dont know this is a chance to captain a winning team another bite of the cherry and i can personally do some things different this time round im not going to sit up here and talk about us winning the world cup we have to qualify for the world cup thats all its as simple as that
5851107 i want to see the england team play like a team
5851108 man thats a bad situation for the north korean medalist who came up positive for the drugs in the 50m pistol
5851109 hold on if a medalist tests positive for the drugs here in canada or the u s they often seal their fate by a bit of media embarrassment and then a likely drink driving incident
5851110 perhaps the ioc could overlook the drug violation in light of the massive risk this might pose for this man i mean unless they are prepared to offer him asylum what would the harm really be for testing positive to a drug that slows down the heart beat

5851194 less people will be going to opunake to surf now that it has taken two of the better breaks out of the equation
5851195 it just means i get to enjoy surfing there without the crowd

5851225 it is offensive that the mayor has not reviewed his position and that he continues as a publicly funded official after his racist remarks
5851226 had it occurred in state or federal government there would have been no discussion that individual would not have continued in that position
5851227 i have run out of lines to say about that

5851308 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
5851309 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5851310 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5851311 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5851312 there is still a lot of work to do before this city is fully recovered
5851313 and for people who are still hurting and not yet back in their homes a brighter day might seem impossible yet a brighter day is coming and it is heralded by hopeful signs of progress

5851344 this is what irks me about obama he takes his time in announcing his vp pick and lets the media clamour all over themselves to get the scoop
5851345 because i love my son and i am obligated to make the best choice for him i will vote for senator clinton on november 4th even if i have to write her name in
5851346 they have not been telling the truth and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying

5851348 you are disowning everything frank marshall davis wrote who cares about the use of the term mentor look in any dictionary you are quibbling about terms that mean the same no matter who uses them how come you havent taken issue with the editor of the books john edgar tidwell and the publishers university of wisconsin press and university press of mississippi i think you should contact the editor and publishers and have them either stand behind what has been written or disown it as you are fully aware if you have ever read either of the two books the only thing i have done is quote the books and say the same thing the editor has stated
5851349 if there is one thing frank marshall davis makes clear is that he had the utmost respect for communists because of the way communists fight for the rights of working people and against racism frank marshall davis was entitled to his political views there is no doubt he joined the ranks of members of the communist party usa along with his very good friends benjamin davis and paul robeson for you to deny this is cowardly shameful and disgusting
5851350 after calling the publishers of daviss books they said they never heard from anyone in the family upset with anything in the books nor is the family contesting anything in the books
5851351 i have had leanings in that direction i e marxism since i was in college
5851352 this was of course consistent with the line of the communist party during the soviet nazi alliance against national defense
5851353 about november 1950 the communist party in hawaii was reorganized on an underground basis in the new organization party groups were to consist of not more than three members groups were identified by numbers 1 10 rather than by names as formerly
5851354 we find that there is no substance to these claims
5851355 i would suggest that you take up your concerns with barack obama who first brought frank marshall davis to our attention
5851356 what you know about politics and its history could fill a thimble
5851357 your feeble attempts at a coherent argument for your candidate which have been conspicuously absent thus far are only dwarfed by your pathetic blah blah blah blah

5851367 health pick ups are limited in tf2 arena some levels dont have any health packs at all so being careful is a good strategy for any class as well with so little health available having a medic or a health dispenser building engineer on your team can be a crucial element to success with their reconnaissance abilities the scout and spy play a far more vital role in arena than in other game modes knowing the location of the enemy team can often mean the difference between a win and a loss the soldier and demoman will find many areas in arena specifically designed for them to get a vertical advantage traditional heavy medic pairings will still be highly useful as the anchor to a good arena team however commit too far in this direction and the enemy can quickly overwhelm you with snipers and spies in arena water is as scarce as health this makes the pyro a much deadlier class as any enemy player he sets on fire with his flamethrower or flare gun will be unable to put out the flames igniting enemies quickly then retreating to safety can be an effective strategy for the pyro

5851369 in contrast to lumberyard ravine has a far more open ground level with emphasis on control of four key choke points a series of canals in ravines lower level provide an excellent opportunity for stealth kills and flanking maneuvers like all arena maps the capture point in the middle becomes active after 60 seconds

5851395 mr mccoskrie keeps harping on that it is pornography they are breasts theyre not a big deal
5851396 it effectively means any topless parade can be held at any time on any street yet this attitude goes against prevailing community standards demonstrated by the fact that we would not allow topless teachers office workers or mcdonalds staff

5851403 we told the airlines we would allow them if someone gave a birth date to exclude that person from the list
5851404 let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk just like everyone else some airlines have done this some have chosen not to because they dont want to spend the money
5851405 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
5851406 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
5851407 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll

5851441 and while i was sitting on the metro i looked in the bag to see if there was any id and i found an envelope with 3 800 cash

5851452 it is important for society to become familiar with the culture customs and day to day lives of native people because they generally only receive attention when they are involved in conflicts
5851453 in the different oral accounts of indigenous groups in chile and the rest of the americas woman is the creator of the universe unlike in western christian belief systems
5851454 women are associated with nature with reproduction they also transmit the native languages
5851455 they have told me that they cannot accept this because it comes from the state it is a position that we respect we cannot force everyone to see this as a good thing there will always be people who dont agree
5851456 this is an opportunity for artists to show and sell their work
5851457 the artists see the biennial as something very important to which time and work must be dedicated

5851471 i am just so proud of myself i just ran across the line thinking i won i may not have had a good season but like at the world championships thats what i train all year for
5851472 this is so devastating for me the gold would have been mine if it werent for a hamstring grab i was in control for half of the race by the 320 metre mark i felt my right hamstring i pulled my leg through and it got tighter and tighter
5851473 it is the top of my career the experience is so great i cant believe it i lost one of my best throws because there were some delays it was during the womens 400m final and i had to take a break i lost my concentration
5851474 this is great moment in my life i want to say olympics i love you i had trained very hard it felt easy

5851478 we are questioning him on the details of other locals involved in the terror attack
5851479 our constitution provides for equality which includes special help and care for the oppressed and weaker sections who have been historically downtrodden the sc st communities in our opinion are also equal citizens and are entitled to a life of dignity in view of article 21 of the constitution as interpreted by this court
5851480 in the age of democracy no people and no community should be treated as being inferior however the truth is that in many parts of our country persons belonging to the sc st are oppressed humiliated and insulted this is a disgrace to our country
5851481 the caste system is a curse on our nation and the sooner it is destroyed the better in fact it is dividing our country at a time when we must all be united as indians if we wish to face the gigantic problems confronting us poverty unemployment price rise corruption etc the 1989 act is a salutary legislative measure in that direction
5851482 in this connection it may be mentioned that in america to use the word nigger today for an african american is regarded as highly offensive and is totally unacceptable even if it was acceptable 50 years ago
5851483 in our opinion calling a member of the scheduled caste chamar with intent to insult or humiliate him in a place within public view is certainly an offence under section 3 1 x of the act whether there was intent to insult or humiliate a person by using the word chamar will of course depend on the context in which it was used
5851484 in a country like ours with so much diversity so many religions castes ethnic and lingual groups etc all communities and groups must be treated with respect and no one should be looked down upon as inferior that is the only way we can keep our country united
5851485 the problem for domestic companies is that they now lag further behind their foreign counterparts

5851549 it is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception

5851551 to accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion it is plain experimental evidence
5851552 it is unacceptable that children have the odds stacked against them simply by default of having poorer parents the government must put its money where its mouth is and end child poverty so that all children no matter their background have equal chances to achieve a decent education
5851553 there has been an enormous programme of social reform over the past 10 years that has lifted 600 000 children out of poverty we are committed to accelerating this and to do this we are narrowing the gap in educational achievement between children from deprived backgrounds and those who are better off

5851605 id rather use a poor christian textbook and supplement it with academic material than to use an academically better secular textbook and try to excise all the flawed philosophy from it
5851606 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5851607 you just sort of eat the same thing that youd eat at any other meal but less
5851608 there are a lot of great coffee buyers who dont have this certification but the amount of coffees were tasting you do need a system it serves as a huge benefit to be able to buy efficiently and effectively
5851609 im qualified to say its not the grade we requested or its better
5851610 individuals who cup and grade coffee in large measure determine the prices paid for the coffees they evaluate
5851611 its like having an outside realtor someone whos trained in appraising value who gives an opinion about what a particular propertys worth
5851612 but dont necessarily pay for other certifications like organic or fair trade
5851613 it could be three coffees from the same region of colombia but ones from a different farm
5851614 you have to get five out of six sets to get it right
5851615 you do it in your daily job and understand it or you dont
5851616 youve got the right amount of taste buds or you dont and youre in touch with them or youre not
5851617 to be honest and trust myself i taste everything better now im a better wine taster and food taster because i can trust im tasting what im tasting and am able to communicate that to other people
5851618 it doesnt change the way we purchase roast or blend coffee but it validates our ability to taste coffee or buy it
5851619 its important because it validates me as a well rounded coffee professional
5851620 for intelligentsia its important because it says the people who we have tasting and grading coffees they understand it
5851621 all customers know is if they like it or dont like it
5851622 at this stage we are very cautious as we have not identified the body
5851623 i dont know how you do it you just have more time than i do

5851638 it was one of those nights when i wore a super tight dress that you couldnt have worn anything under since it would have showed the paparazzi were literally lowering their cameras like speculums when i got out of the car
5851639 on the way home i said to my husband darling i think they might have gotten it and so when we pulled in i made him re enact the thing with his camera a sort of crime scene run through it appears i survived unscathed
5851640 mom pulled out some embarrassing stuff but im like just dont pull out my underwear
5851641 i was making a homosexual pass that until this day i thought had been accepted

5851648 we filled up the cart and my mom left me alone and i went through and picked out what i could do without

5851650 school supplies may be for many a luxury as opposed to something that a few years ago was something that was very ordinary
5851651 in those cases you are talking about a scale of engineering that you cant even imagine
5851652 theres a certain trust you have with a company in terms of needing to send confidential information so it can be used in generated reports but its with the obligation that that information is kept secure
5851653 review the incident and evaluate our security and policy procedures
5851654 theres a certain trust you have with a company in terms of needing to send confidential information so it can be used in generated reports but its with the obligation that that information is kept secure
5851655 review the incident and evaluate our security and policy procedures
5851656 nonetheless we have apologized to our customers for this situation and assured them that access to the information has been closed and that we are working diligently to put in place any needed remedies to make certain this problem does not recur

5851660 thus the covenant that god made with the jewish people through moses remains eternally valid for them
5851661 to the jewish people whom god first chose to hear his word belong the sonship the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and of their race according to the flesh is the christ
5851662 are in a real relationship with god based on a covenant that has never been revoked
5851663 all covenants with israel find fulfillment in christ who is the savior of all

5851667 the nursing staff had evaluated the patients nutrition the review revealed no nutritional consult was requested and revealed no evidence the physician was notified about the inadequate nutritional intake
5851668 they said he was lying down and didnt feel like talking
5851669 they wouldnt let me see him i think he died that day
5851670 those are the years where kids still are kids you want to say theyre adults but they dont behave as adults when it comes to drinking
5851671 theres a lot of things that i think make the debate timely
5851672 whether its our kids giving their lives at 18 to save this country i think the issues about voting and responsibility to vote
5851673 im trying to understand if it should be reduced at all should it be reduced in certain circumstances at certain locations
5851674 colleges already have kids drinking that are 18 19 20 so why not make it legal
5851675 i think there are certain circumstances where people are responsible at 18 to drink
5851676 i dont think 18 year olds of today are responsible
5851677 i dont think it will make any difference because if the kids want to drink at age of 18 theyll drink anyway
5851678 i think people should consider lowering the drinking age and increase the driving age
5851679 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5851680 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5851681 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
5851682 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
5851683 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
5851684 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
5851685 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
5851686 i would like to sincerely thank the university of north dakota and the und athletic department for the opportunities i have had over the past eight years
5851687 it has been a tremendous experience most important are the people i have met and lifelong relationships i have formed the athletic department administration staff coaches and student athletes as well as the entire university community alumni association and foundation sioux boosters letterwinners association ralph engelstad arena and alerus center staff media fans and the grand forks community have all been fantastic i will always consider myself part of und athletics and i am looking forward to watching und continue its outstanding athletic tradition in the coming years
5851688 we appreciate the outstanding job that dan has done for und athletics and we wish the best for him and his family
5851689 people get spiritually nurtured here they feel spiritually fed even the facilitators
5851690 i dont think of myself as the teacher but as someone whos also on the journey and my journey is enhanced by participating in the gathering it brings insights into my entire life
5851691 everything i knew to be true in my life i found at ruhi
5851692 i never knew there was a group of people who believed what i believed the facilitator had the same passion and energy as we did
5851693 ive never had family before when i was 14 i was living on the streets in canada once i started ruhi my husband saw a profound shift in me
5851694 from each according to his ability to each according to his need
5851695 other than fame for the presenters and mit what good comes out of this research i do not see how the world is a better place with the publicity of defrauding transit systems there is nothing responsible about this i see this as a malicious action
5851696 is it an irresponsible disclosure after the researcher has notified the company in this case mbta but discloses the vulnerability before it is fixed
5851697 what if it takes a long time for the company to fix the vulnerability
5851698 in this particular case it is arguable whether the vulnerability they discovered was critical or not how many people would hack the rfid card to get free rides on the t the mbta is probably better off letting them publish the result and work with the researchers to fix the vulnerability rather than pursuing injunction in the court system

5851707 i did not get everything i was looking for but we will go away and have a look at it and it will stand us in good stead ahead of the portugal game
5851708 it only feels like it was a few weeks ago i was in trinidad to be honest
5851709 i really enjoyed being out there and to get a run out for 20 minutes was great i really enjoyed it and it shows the hard work ive put in
5851710 my target this season is to start every single game i can my main aim from the summer was to start the first game of the season for arsenal and ive done that hopefully i can keep my position and play well score 15 goals and get 15 assists thats quite a good way to come back and hopefully i can break into the england team as well
5851711 we have had meetings about it to try and get it into our heads that every game is a cup final with england there are no friendlies weve got to go out there and play well win the game and take that into the qualifiers we have to gel as a team and thats what we can achieve in these games playing with a good tempo
5851712 the world cup hit me straight away being in front of big crowds and i wasnt used to it at all
5851713 watching the euros on tv i thought it would have been great to be there and having been to a world cup i know what to expect
5851714 i said right from the start that spain would win it and they did cesc who was brilliant throughout the tournament and did really well for them he was buzzing when he came back to arsenal
5851715 its always good to have a trophy winner coming back into the changing room and it gets everyone on a high to see his face when he came back to training for the first time just shows what a big player he is and what he did for spain
5851716 ive been able to watch the odd event here and there between training the main thing i love to watch is 100 metres and 200 metres
5851717 theyre my main ones to watch and having just seen usain bolt hes just unbelievable really

5851731 joining the linux foundation is an indication of our growing presence within both linux and the wider open source community particularly in the enterprise space
5851732 we believe that ubuntu is gaining traction in enterprise deployments at the server level as well as on the desktop and its good for us to have ways to communicate this
5851733 i think it is significant that canonical is joining the linux foundation they have been involved closely with us since the inception of the foundation they participate in the linux standard base for instance they attend our collaboration summits and mark shuttleworth founder and ceo of canonical is on the board as an individual member by officially joining they are putting resources behind our work and more than anything showing they value that work
5851734 we have a huge global user base and tremendous backing from our community who ultimately make ubuntu possible
5851735 these people have a strong voice and their advocacy around the world is driving linux adoption at all levels from mobile devices to the cloud
5851736 membership gives us a voice within a key influencing organization and visibility to the growing corporate membership of the foundation
5851737 we see acceptance of linux in major corporations and public sector organizations accelerating and the foundation is doing a great job in supporting that
5851738 the linux foundation occupies a critical noncommercial function in the use and popularization of linux around the world weve always seen the linux foundations value and are pleased to now become an official member and support its activities
5851739 we look forward to working with them to continue the march of linux in all areas of computing
5851740 there is no question that the ubuntu distribution has advanced the state of linux on the desktop
5851741 their focus on usability and branding is being felt throughout the industry
5851742 canonical is an important new member for the linux foundation matt and his team have created an exciting distribution that has taken the world by storm they have rallied the cause of cross industry cross community collaboration for years we are extremely pleased to work even more closely with canonical as we push linux to the next stage of growth

5851759 jika seseorang memiliki air wudhu yang hanya cukup untuk sebagian anggota wudhunya maka ia wajib berwudhu dengan air sedapat mungkin pada anggota wudhunya kemudian bertayammum untuk menggantikan anggota wudhu yang belum terkena air karena allah
5851760 dibolehkan bertayammum dengan bagian atas tanah baik itu berupa debu tanah lembab atau pasir dan inilah pendapat yang benar sebagaimana perkataan para ulama terhadap ayat mulakhosh fiqhi
5851761 shaiid adalah bagian atas tanah dan wajib bagi manusia jika bertayammum untuk memukulkan kedua tangannya ke bagian atas tanah tidak menjadi masalah yang terdapat padanya debu atau bukan karena makna shaiid bukanlah debu namun bagian atas tanah baik debu maupun bukan debu
5851762 begini sudah cukup beliau memukulkan kedua telapak tangannya ke tanah kemudian meniup keduanya lalu mengusapnya ke wajah dan punggung telapak tangannya
5851763 jika mengusap dengan cara dua kali memukulkan tangan ke tanah yaitu yang pertama untuk mengusap wajah dan yang kedua untuk mengusap badan maka ini boleh namun yang sesuai sunnah adalah cara yang pertama sekali memukul ke tanah
5851764 pembatal tayammum adalah semua pembatal wudhu selain itu juga yang termasuk pembatal tayammum adalah didapatinya air atau adanya kemampuan untuk bersuci dengan air bagi yang bertayammum karena uzdur ketidakmampuan bersuci dengan air dan shalat yang telah dilaksanakan dengan tayammum tidak wajib diulangi menurut pendapat yang benar

5851767 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5851768 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5851769 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

5851773 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5851774 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5851775 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5851776 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5851777 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5851778 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5851779 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5851780 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5851781 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5851782 were not doing this as a good public policy process
5851783 answer this question that has been so contentious between the two branches ever since 1971
5851784 this is a great opportunity to address a major challenging issue for parents and families
5851785 it also gives employers a chance to provide this coverage and employers dont have to pay for it
5851786 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5851787 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5851788 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5851789 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5851790 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5851791 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5851792 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5851793 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5851794 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5851795 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5851796 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5851797 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5851798 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5851799 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5851800 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5851801 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5851802 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5851803 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5851804 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5851805 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5851806 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5851807 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5851808 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5851809 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5851810 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5851811 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5851812 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5851813 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5851814 is spoil the surprise of discovering what kind of story it is would knowing up front give a different expectation and reading experience than if one did not know
5851815 youre going to have expertise in your team were not going to be even in the middle so that way you can invest the expertise for what you need and were not holding you up or bringing you into a slower position
5851816 of course i dropped everything and waited another few minutes with him as he put his shoes on
5851817 i love that song mommy do you know why because it makes me feel happy inside
5851818 the most important new product helps companies stay safe as their employees access these networking and community sites like a myspace
5851819 basically these sites are now prime targets for the bad guys theyve learned that when users put in content they can put attacking content up on these web sites
5851820 that was our expectation that as the market matured larger players would move in
5851821 we know more about the bad stuff on the web than anybody in the world
5851822 with release of new products this quarter the company needs to successfully execute on new product sales
5851823 we were so busy in the first quarter of this year we were less aggressive than we normally would have been in terms of promotional activities
5851824 basically that consists of discounting to encourage customers to take longer subscriptions i think given the financial situation not giving the customers a good cost of money return was an error
5851825 many of these sites were saying today was the best inquiry theyd had on the first day in the past four or five agquips
5851826 a lot of the larger machinery had embraced the hobby farmer interest with a lot more compact tractors at the field days this year
5851827 there has been a lot more interest in grain storage facilities due in the main to the loss of the single desk
5851828 there are two things you need while searching for coal seam gas
5851829 there are some decent coal seams in the basin and that gives us hope
5851830 that sort of coal is the sort we are chasing
5851831 i dont know where they would have gotten the information
5851832 thats not accurate council have invested about 5 million with them and of that weve taken out 500 000
5851833 council still has the money in that we had at the time it was not with a cdo
5851834 the current valuation is less than what we had actually paid for them but we have to record that in our accounts
5851835 all our investments are still paying quite good interest its just a question of whether we get the cash back when they mature
5851836 thats not right our understanding is that theres basically no market at the moment but we are still getting coupon payments
5851837 we cant make a decision until we get it the advice back
5851838 we really need to get some information councils being informed of the developments and were just waiting to see where we go with the legal advice
5851839 market re evaluations of those securities if we were to resell them in the marketplace today would mean wed incur a loss of about 1 2 million because the market has dropped considerably
5851840 were not proposing to sell them at this stage with the market being depressed as it is
5851841 the cdos we hold are corporate cdos theyre not sub prime theyre cdos to do with corporate institutions
5851842 i dont know where they the sydney morning herald got their figures from these figures are published every month as part of our council meeting notes its public information
5851843 because thats not a set and forget were taking each security as an individual case in its own right
5851844 were just managing each of the investments case by case with an independent advisor
5851845 its a very insignificant amount of money in relative terms compared to our total investment package
5851846 were still receiving our total interest entitlement theres been no defaults and we dont see any need to incur legal expenses in pursuing the issue
5851847 well be looking at the restructuring of those existing cdos that dont retain the triple a rating well obviously look at disposing of that investment at an appropriate time
5851848 throw them in jail make yourself feel good great theyre going to come out theyre going to drink and theyre going to drive if you dont get to the underlying problem you might as well give it up
5851849 the acquisition is a sound strategy and a natural fit of two complimentary companies
5851850 were pleased that the trenstar tracking solutions products will be integrated into fluensees and that this integration will help fluensee continue to deliver comprehensive solutions that use rfid to track and manage the physical movement of assets and inventory
5851851 this represents a significant step for fluensee in our strategy to accelerate growth
5851852 today we significantly increased our presence in new verticals where we see huge opportunities for the adoption of rfid and strengthened our ability to provide enhanced solutions to our customers in information technology transportation logistics manufacturing government oil gas and mining we look forward to building value for our shareholders by delivering on the promise of this acquisition
5851853 behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world
5851854 search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting
5851855 idea will ensure that the sec continues to stay ahead of the needs of investors
5851856 ideas launch represents a fundamental change in the way the sec collects and publishes company and fund information and in the way that investors will be able to use it
5851857 when congress created the sec and even when edgar was launched the markets worked on paper and by mail today the marketplace works online and by e mail
5851858 companies and investors alike compile analyze and produce information and reports electronically with the move to an electronic data based filing system the sec will not only keep pace with the markets but will provide investors with a dynamic usable system they can use to get the information they need
5851859 after 75 years of document based static financial reporting whether in paper documents or in electronic equivalents like pdfs it is exciting to see the sec poised to cross the data threshold and help investors receive financial information that is dynamic usable and ready to go as they make their investment decisions

5851871 general question ive seen this fix in a number of places and im wondering if its a security issue to have all of these folders set to 777
5851872 its at my home because i have musical performance later on so i cant wear it becoz my character is one sided love its not possible to have any ring
5851873 solbi definitely will come to all watched where solbi will be sitting

5851877 gigastor sas customers have so far been either government or financial organizations with extremely large storage and or long term data retention needs
5851878 the larger storage needs are due to either high network volumes or regulations that mandate and govern long term data retention coupled with the trend to consolidate activities into larger data centers customer demand for larger scalable solutions will continue to increase

5851880 gt wrote an excellent rundown of her experience in gauging the iphone 3g speed last week but she overlooks a few points
5851881 the idea is everyones property values increase if the homes look compatible although they dont have to be identical
5851882 i think theres a general buyer mindset now that they want a good deal
5851883 what that good deal might look like depends on the buyer
5851884 wont someone wait till the house is down to 1 to swipe it up
5851885 the condo board isnt in a position to make a call
5851886 if they dont respond or say no theyve turned down what is very likely a reasonable request
5851887 if someone is calling and e mailing and asking questions in 24 hours max you ought to get an answer
5851888 there still should be some understanding of when this person is going to communicate
5851889 if its clear its a case of unmet expectations and if the broker doesnt help go to the owner
5851890 the second mortgage was usually an adjustable rate loan with a balloon payment requiring complete repayment of that loan within a just a few years and thats what got people into trouble
5851891 lenders would sell these loans with the idea that home values would go up and that would take care of it because the owners could then refinance
5851892 here you buy this house for this inflated value your payments are set for this period of time and when you cant refi or sell to cover the drastic decline in your value and your inability to make payments well come and take the house and sue you for any deficiency between current value and what you owe
5851893 you havent succeeded with texas buyers who can see these properties in the context of that real estate market and now youre thinking of people here who have less knowledge of it why would somebody in seattle do something you cant get anyone in houston to do
5851894 when these things come together its because both parties are improving their position
5851895 have good outgoing communications with owners such as regular meetings newsletters and web site updates
5851896 remind them of the policy if they whine again remind them again
5851897 there are a lot of issues with these agreements if theyre not properly drafted
5851898 the general power of attorney forms that are commonly used have no specific language allowing gifting
5851899 the sole reason for doing the move out report is to figure out what damages there are over and above normal wear and tear
5851900 the tenant has a right in my opinion to be at both inspections
5851901 any restrictions on what a buyer can do lessens its value its like if i sell you my car and say you cant drive it at night
5851902 basically whatever two parties want to contract to they can
5851903 are valid and enforceable if the court deems them to be reasonable
5851904 through data center consolidation and virtualization end users are trying to improve the utilization of hardware and lower the cost
5851905 we enable the consolidation to happen much faster because when you consolidate servers into one platform the amount of memory in the platform has to double or quadruple in order for you to enable the consolidation
5851906 we believe that ddr3 registered dimms dual in line memory module are going to be a significant portion of the server market
5851907 registered dimms are a much low power solution for servers while fully buffered dimms will have a place in the market registered dimms are more suited for the high end of the market especially with the four and eight socket systems we also think the makers of two socket systems will also adopt registered dimms
5851908 are going to be the biggest releases of delphi and c in many years going back to the delphi 7 time frame
5851909 we think the packaged software industry and the line of business and client server area are very important parts of the software market and delphi and c builder are premier tools for these areas
5851910 weve gone through the products from top to bottom and unicode enabled everything
5851911 our goal as a combined company is to eliminate the development barriers between applications and databases
5851912 this release combines database architecture and design features from er studio with delphi and c builder to create the ultimate database application design and development solution the all new delphi and c builder architect editions
5851913 esto es un mensaje para la juventud para que nunca baje los brazos
5851914 democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word equality but notice the difference while democracy seeks equality in liberty socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude
5851915 we do not have a huge presence in china or the pacific rim
5851916 as a b to c company we have to have a better understanding of what our end users are using
5851917 the receiver would be endowed by the court with the authority of the association
5851918 but in the long run it would be more expensive because owners would have to pay for maintenance and the costs of the lawsuit and the receiver so theyd end up paying extra to have someone not of their own choosing do the work for them
5851919 square down the middle of what governments have the right to do which is regulate land use
5851920 people who own property dont have the absolute right to do anything they want with it but they do have a right to make some reasonable economic use of the property
5851921 the end result is the same you caused me to lose my data
5851922 if you know your site was infected dont you have an ethical responsibility to provide a warning shouldnt we change the rules so that the guy with a sexually transmitted disease has to say hes infecting people
5851923 if this were to prevent one breach of someones private data the good would have outweighed the expense
5851924 the real problem is that no one is fixing their sites
5851925 the same tens of thousands of sites get infected over and over with different malware using the same methods a few class action lawsuits could be a good incentive to fix this
5851926 should hundreds of millions of disclosure messages have gone out we dont want to create unnecessary noise or panic or distract from the messages that really matter
5851927 we have a real problem with hard data in our industry and we need a kind of statistical clearinghouse
5851928 the most important new product helps companies stay safe as their employees access these networking and community sites like a facebook or a myspace
5851929 basically these sites are now prime targets for the bad guys theyve learned that when users put in content they can put attacking content up on these web sites

5851935 the installed base is still good but websense has never really been a technology innovator

5851938 i must say that its been surprisingly difficult in various conversations with folks not immersed in the ixd space to get across the essential distinction between context aware applications and location based services lbs
5851939 for consumers it should mean keeping an eye on possible plasma bargains some believe the plasma picture is better so if you can get it cheaper do so

5851941 geneva afp a giant inflatable dog turd by american artist paul mccarthy blew away from an exhibition in the garden of a swiss museum bringing down a power line and breaking a greenhouse window before it landed again the museum said monday
5851942 im encouraged when i look at the stats considering we were playing with such a young team
5851943 i think that we have some boundaries to take care of defensively
5851944 we gave up five goals inside the 18 yard box to wake forest that were lack of defensive presence i thought wake forest had some quality attacking but i think we have some defensive issues that we need to sort out before sunday i thought we had some quality runs and quality looks at the frame offensively

5851950 fox has no financial risk here in a movie that could produce revenues for it as such i doubt that fox is going to force warner bros to shelve the movie
5851951 in all likelihood a settlement will be reached whereby warner bros gets to distribute the movie and fox gets a piece of the action
5851952 i assume fox is playing hardball to extract as much money as they can from the project but i cant imagine the movie itself would be blocked i dont know what the evidence is but it sounds like the individual producers are at the crux of the matter
5851953 the bad news is that its going to be an arduous process
5851954 the good news is that fox and warner bros have until march 2009 watchmens current release date to figure it out and come to a settlement
5851955 its the most exciting thing on the horizon its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
5851956 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their head and having writers on board and producers that are in to it its been a fun thing
5851957 how could i express what i was feeling in a way that didnt sound like bitching about george bush i mean you know i love neil young but i didnt want to listen to that record really
5851958 my reaction to that kind of record is we know this its obvious so it started with me trying to write it as a piece of fiction i was thinking it could be the worst idea ever in the world but if it doesnt work it doesnt have to come out i started by writing a kind of world bible about what life would be like around 15 or 20 years from now if things continue on the same path i spent a few weeks filling it in with the events that could lead to this kind of time and place then as an experiment i started writing songs about people in this place and from different points of view
5851959 i had a record that would make sense to me but no one else would ever know what it was because there was no narrative its modular its a collection of snapshots these were glimpses of a place maybe with liner notes i could communicate some of it but how do you get liner notes in 2007
5851960 that was the route we were going to go with initially we talked to a different companies about releasing it but it didnt feel quite right we thought about a film but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right then i started thinking about how i could make it really interactive something you experience rather than something you read
5851961 i just pitched it to hbo two weeks ago in l a it went great ideally were trying to get them to do a two year limited series i prefer that over a film we would have a second arg tying into the second album and ties into the series and they all happen together with a budget needed to pull that all off there would be a tour down the road the record completes the story the ending that no one knows i know what happens i knew when i started it and its not what people think
5851962 our construction business has been a real standout for us as well as capturing a larger percentage of the resource infrastructure market in the pilbara region of western australia it remains focused on winning additional work on the east coast of australia
5851963 the mining business continues to grow and the number of contracts extended during the year highlights
5851964 with the ongoing focus by australian governments on infrastructure spending coupled with strong
5851965 a strong order book is a clear indicator of a contracting companys standing and at 30 june the order
5851966 macmahon remains a performance driven company and is committed to partnering with its customers to
5851967 we already have 1 2 billion of revenue secured for fy09 and are expecting to deliver annual profit
5851968 i am starting to become concerned again we are not coming out of the housing slump
5851969 lower rates and time are not fixing the credit crisis we are about to begin what looks like a prolonged journey to the bottom of the economic sea and it is hard to find a happy face on wall street
5851970 it isnt even obvious that the worst is over the latest turmoil among the gses fannie and freddie and the widening credit quality spreads in the money and bond markets is certainly unsettling banks will have to refinance lots of their maturing bonds during the second half of this year they will have to pay higher yields and that will force them to raise their lending rates
5851971 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
5851972 the remaining contingent that was used to reinforce the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the territory of south ossetia and to russia
5851973 this is one of the first units to be pulled out
5851974 the russians time and again move their tanks to tskhinvali the south ossetian capital from gori and then back again i categorically deny this amounts to a withdrawal
5851975 prevent weapons smuggling and members of foreign terrorist organisations from entering russia
5851976 you can probably judge objectively for yourselves the state of georgian democracy and who is trying to wreck it
5851977 last week 15 3 04 lukoils chief executive vagit alekperov met iraqs oil minister ibrahim bahr al ulum who has said that oil companies of different countries should do business in iraq according to him talks with lukoil were held in december 2003 during their march 11th meeting in baghdad they signed a deal to train iraqi oil industry employees and students 40 iraqi students will study in russias i m gubkin oil and gas university their numbers will increase to 100 students in 2005
5851978 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5851979 theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5851980 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5851981 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves
5851982 simply keeping a lid on 90210 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5851983 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5851984 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5851985 her boyfriends husbands pants are too tight and too polyester
5851986 thats why she works so much but a careers the only thing shes got
5851987 its not like shes got a good job to keep her occupied she must be devastated
5851988 if you decide to continue with your childless relationship there could be a price to pay in the future
5851989 i think sometimes the downfall will be if we dont look at the whole picture
5851990 the typical american requires the resources of at least five acres of land
5851991 it has been estimated that if everyone on earth lived the american consumptive lifestyle it would require two or three more planet earths
5851992 imagine if the same effort we have put into fossil fuels had instead been invested in solar technologies
5851993 theres the term out there called green washing which is very similar to whitewashing
5851994 its when youre overusing the term green more to sell a product than through the actual changes you have made
5851995 for some folks its just to be part of a movement whether theyre doing anything or not
5851996 now we dont need to inherit that knowledge from our parents and theres this supermarket mentality that sells the idea of quickness
5851997 alright warren you are such a big boy we are almost done now i just have to take a look underneath your undies its okay because youre at the doctors office and your momma is right here but its not okay to let anyone else do this alright
5851998 yeah sometimes he likes to color his balls today they are purple last week they were green ive given up on trying to stop it
5851999 well he did a nice job staying in that uh area i guess at least we know he has good fine motor skills
5852000 i felt very bad then i wanted to play the match again but if i look back i can be proud of how far i reached i really wasnt expecting to reach the last eight that quarter final is not going to haunt me and i know i have to focus on the future besides it isnt the first time i lost with such a huge lead
5852001 i was staying in the athletes village and i saw so many stars but i couldnt meet him
5852002 the birds nest is superb and everywhere you go you meet such amazing athletes i was in awe of them they looked so fit and you could make out how hard they worked
5852003 i will be going to play the asian circuit in three weeks and im back to my usual training routine i put in some extra hours yesterday because i knew i had to come to delhi to compensate for time lost
5852004 akhil is the one they all want to emulate so that loss was hard to take for all of us
5852005 well be back at the hostel in the day tomorrow
5852006 you see what their performances have done to the city an olympic medal you can guess
5852007 i was saddened at the apparent lack of planning from him you judge in the first round and you formulate your plan by the second starts but by his third round i was totally distraught with the approach
5852008 i thank you all for your support of our family it has been hard to deal with but life must go on
5852009 if you would like to make a donation to help our family we have set up a paypal account to do so contact for more details
5852010 i was doing it out of the kindness of my heart but i was also being deceived and i felt really stupid
5852011 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5852012 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5852013 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5852014 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5852015 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5852016 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5852017 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5852018 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5852019 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry
5852020 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
5852021 were not pushing on the tax reductions or whatever but for the school districts were trying to work very close to them because they can come out an absolute winner for the kids and thats one of my big deals is you heard me say is the future
5852022 this new law is a message to drunk drivers stop your irresponsible behaviour or you could lose your wheels
5852023 this new law is very important in fighting impaired driving
5852024 vendors were selected because they exemplified our choices for healthy and natural and promote wellness
5852025 we are fully accredited with all services in one place
5852026 because the lake tahoe community may not be as familiar with the carson cancer center we have produced a video that we feel gives a good snapshot of our center services and staff
5852027 im just gonna say a lot of big records i was on a good portion of those records or asked to be on a good portion of those records that lil wayne was on along with him not like they asked me before they asked him or vice versa i know i was on a good portion of those records cause the i cant feel my face thing we were pushing that hard people wanted to get both of us i couldnt go as far as the clearances i could do my verse then it got to the point where i couldnt go there with people because i didnt want them to think that it was me being the bad guy not clearing stuff i didnt want that on my name so i would let people know if you wanna just put it out on the mixtapes we could do that all day the fans definitely missed out on a lot of juelz due to my contract
5852028 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5852029 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5852030 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5852031 how many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition

5852116 what were they thinking they should find someone else to do this yossys like an alpha wolf she expects everyone to do what she says especially the younger ones remember how she treated nigaki as her own personal servant theres no way someone like you can control her
5852117 they act like just because im in school ive got lots of free time or something let me tell you im not looking forward to baby sitting everyones favorite lovable baka not only will i have to deal with yossy but i also have to worry about all the girls that adore her they will undoubtedly get mad if i do anything that would upset or insult their precious class clown

5852121 thanks mako im probably going to need all the help i can get
5852122 you dont have to worry ive got this all figured out
5852123 yup but not for long listen konkon i was thinking about this all night i really dont care for any kinda tutoring or whatever but i figure the only way out of this is to actually do the work so thats why i brought this paper with me is it enough the schedule you gave me said the first lesson would be math right
5852124 um yes that should be more then enough so do you want to get started
5852125 absolutely im playing tennis with rika in a little bit and i dont want to be late
5852126 i like the confidence yoshizawa san but youre probably going to be late there are like a hundred problems and theyre pretty difficult
5852127 um i think you misunderstood im not going to do them you are
5852128 look its easy you write the answers on this page and then when i come back ill copy the answers onto this other page and turn it in and tadaa the work is done and meanwhile i was able to stare at rikas hot bod in her skimpy tennis outfit see great idea right
5852129 you see doesnt this sight make you proud shes only got a little bit of spare time and she uses it to help us out now thats what i call dedication
5852130 well lets just say the work will be turned in on time
5852131 thats great news for some reason i was worried that she wouldnt cooperate
5852132 hey konkon whats up how did it go with yocchan
5852133 aaah yeah i figured something like that would happen whatd she do
5852134 hm so did you actually do it the work did you finish it
5852135 yes but i didnt have a choice she just walked out without even asking me how i felt about it at all
5852136 you did have a choice the choice of not doing it and letting her roast for not staying
5852137 no i couldnt do something like that shes still my friend even if she can be infuriating
5852138 im starting to think i should ask someone else for help someone whos just a little less in love with her then you are
5852139 sorry konkon but you know how much i like her
5852140 i know thats the problem anyways what was your point in all of that drabble just now
5852141 my point is that youre gonna have to do what not too many other people will dare heh youll have to stand up to her
5852142 yeah dont let her get away with mistreating you show her whos the boss if she wont do the work then make her everyone thinks youre just this simple little timid mouse but truthfully there is a lot more strength in you then people give you credit for you can do this konkon dont back down and tell her whats what
5852143 i will thanks mako tomorrow shell do the lesson for sure
5852144 and her wit is clever and genuinely funny i dont think you could classify that as class clown shes so much more then that
5852145 you did have a choice the choice of not doing it and letting her roast for not staying
5852146 no i couldnt do something like that shes still my friend even if she can be infuriating
5852147 i can re yokozano a yossy konno story ch 1 in which an impossible task is given
5852148 and her wit is clever and genuinely funny i dont think you could classify that as class clown shes so much more then that
5852149 if i study real hard i may just have the smarts of a chimpanzee what do you think teach
5852150 well going by these answers i think youre setting your goal a bit too high maybe the smarts of a small lab rat but look on the bright side at least you did well in the math
5852151 not really i mean the extension to my tutoring lessons kinda sucks but
5852152 hey im man enough to admit when ive been pwned i guess this means youre gonna stop giving me the answers huh
5852153 nope it just means that youre going to have to actually check every answer to make sure its correct
5852154 gee if thats the case i might as well just sit down and do the work myself
5852155 yeah i admit you got me good but i still have no intentions of wasting my precious time in any of these books although i must say your cool points through the roof girl seriously i didnt think you had it in you im totally impressed
5852156 you cant be serious just do the lessons yossy its just for two hours in the afternoons surely you can spare that much time out of your schedule and get the worksheets done look at me even with my schooling i was able to squeeze the tutoring in
5852157 im not like you kon kon i have a life
5852158 some of us happen to think that there is more to living then just chasing skirts and adding notches to ones belt
5852159 yeah right only people whove never had a notch feel that way buuut i wouldnt expect a cold fish like you to understand that
5852160 if youre not a cold fish this little task will be no problem for you
5852161 uh s studying we should be studying we should get to work
5852162 kiss me and ill do the work willingly for the rest of our sessions
5852163 i am not and besides who cares we should be studying not talking about kisses and cold fish which im not by the way
5852164 whatever i dont feel like goofing around with you when all you want to do is keep bring up the studing every five seconds im out of here
5852165 youre not skipping out of the tutoring i painstakingly put together are you
5852166 of course im not skipping out of those wonderful lessons you have provided for me im just uh
5852167 uh getting a glass of water for my hard working tutor ill just be heading on my way now
5852168 i better see some improvement this week hitomi or im taking something away
5852169 its not a big deal she was just trying to ruffle my feathers its not like i did it or anything
5852170 why couldnt i have been the tutor im not a cold fish that kiss shouldve been mine noooo
5852171 just because i want a romantic kiss with someone i love doesnt make me a cold fish i dont do that with just anybody
5852172 who wouldnt kiss yossy if she gives them permission a cold fish thats who
5852173 im not gay did you ever think about that why would i want to kiss another girl
5852174 it doesnt matter i dont see her like that i like boys i want to date boys and when i kiss i want it to be a boy
5852175 you didnt kiss yossy when her lips were like right there all this time i never knew my best friend was a cold fish
5852176 im not a you know what i give up you and yossy can think whatever you want just as long as she does the lessons and doesnt give me any more trouble
5852177 i dont think so mako chan theres no way she can get out of the tutoring now their on to her
5852178 were going to try to put some more effort into it tomorrow and move on
5852179 i dont have any issues now its just a matter of throwing and seeing what happens
5852180 it will be 10 times the size of the super bowl
5852181 the scale of this network is so large that instead of laying stuff down on the ground we put it underground and are bringing it up to where its needed
5852182 the equipment that were installing basically looks like a wi fi network thats geared for cellular coverage
5852183 what happens is that wireless operators will put in base stations on site and from those base stations we will transport their signals from various parts of the buildings through antenna points
5852184 basically we were getting ready to go live and i saw something forming up in the sky
5852185 im surprised he didnt get hit by a car because we have a1a right here
5852186 i think it was a miracle that he just flew over the street and into the thing
5852187 kevin is an experienced kite boarder and an all around great guy we ask that you keep kevin in your prayers and respect our privacy
5852188 hes refusing to sign the conditions the judge imposed on him yesterday
5852189 his attorney made it clear he was going to agree to the new terms
5852190 the court basically said the defendant has the option at any time to sign the conditions of release
5852191 if he does so the jail will release him if not and he chooses to remain in custody the court date will remain as previously set

5852194 we havent seen anything like this before where a company scores 10 points over its nearest rival
5852195 there was a question mark last year about apple that maybe it had taken its eye off the ball by concentrating on the iphone but now the iphone and ipod and mac are nicely aligned
5852196 most of apples windows based competition is suffering a bit from vista
5852197 complaints about vista are generating complaints about the computer makers
5852198 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
5852199 most lose it slowly like dell has which took a while and we see companies improve but apples extreme volatility is almost like its stock price
5852200 apple will be very difficult to catch but i dont think that these results where theres a 10 point difference will hold
5852201 my guess is that they will regroup at some point and come back
5852202 theres always going to be somebody who finds a business use for these apps
5852203 internet client software such as itunes twhirl second life and others seem to be adopted by individuals rather than organizations
5852204 certain organizations look the other way with a dont ask dont tell policy
5852205 firefox itunes and others are in use where there is a clear business need unless you are in a paramilitary environment where people follow the orders of the authorities its best to make allowances in the interest of productivity
5852206 if you dont then you are more of a cop and less of an enabler
5852207 you dont necessarily want to open the kimono and say everybody should be downloading consumer tools but you do have to look at why its happening
5852208 ebay operates on one technology platform and to the extent that ebay has to change its business model in other countries it would change it everywhere
5852209 if we have to change our business in relation to the tribunal de commerces ruling it will be a massive undertaking
5852210 we dont view it as just affecting ebay france but affecting all ebay sites globally
5852211 at this point were focused on building our organic strategy
5852212 the ability to talk to a search engine is perhaps the simplest its ever been
5852213 those are the three things that i believe are going to cause search to change
5852214 you can see that today in what we have done with image search what we have done with video search
5852215 to say that were not a media company would be hypocrisy
5852216 ive not been successful in finding the right price and the right camera on google
5852217 i could see live search was different the fact that its different i think means its going to have some potential
5852218 you agree not to install use or run the apple software on any non apple labeled computer or to enable others to do so
5852219 recently our sales team has received several inquiries as to whether or not our systems are still available
5852220 customers who purchased open computing products with apples os x leopard will receive a disc that will allow them to reinstall their os should something go drastically wrong or if they feel like getting a new start

5852233 rex is just letting him do a little bit more work everytime hes doing fine hes a tremendous athlete tremendously positive attitude well see im not sure when hell be back we said nebraska it would be great if we had him back by then we very possibly could get him back earlier than that that would be nice not only for him but certainly for our football team
5852234 its the first time ive had a president of the university since ive been here 9 years ever come and talk to our team it was interesting he talked to them about leadership and things that are real important as far as making a team work and then he thanked them he thanked them for what they had done to help the university of missouri i always tell our players were all on the same team here the professors coaches or the administration we all represent the university of missouri i think they all appreciated that that the positive publicity thats been happening through football and other sports is tremendously positive for this university
5852235 today my finger is feeling good and im ready to start doing stuff again
5852236 its painful watching everyone else but theyre letting me just run routes and pretend like im catching the ball tomorrow he can catch balls thats the plan
5852237 anti abortionists would like us to believe that women who have abortions suffer lifelong regrets
5852238 the ones i worry about are those who have the baby
5852239 it is not in the interests of any child to have a 16 year old mother
5852240 has an impact solely on the women having these abortions
5852241 this is my opinion pure and simple but its by no means authoritative
5852242 somebody has to say this is not right and hold their feet to the fire
5852243 i worked some 30 years for the county and i feel that citizens have a right to be heard

5852252 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
5852253 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
5852254 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
5852255 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate

5852284 inseparable from the desire for power the abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige not for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality
5852285 el viejo malvado ermita o y solitario solo tenia un loro y dos perros a quienes gustaba de maltratar se le podia escuchar entre los aullidos de los canes descargar su vida necia en golpes e improperios hacia las inocentes victimas que aun a pesar de su maldad nunca le abandonaron y cuando los gritos cesaron y el viejo se fue a la tumba por los alrededores o vigilando acongojados sobre su lapida el pueblo y los sepultureros les podian ver cada dia

5852287 while other campaigns continue to take tens of thousands of dollars from lobbyists and pacs i have joined with barack obama and the democratic national committee dnc and rejected this money washington like albany is broken because the status quo allows insiders to write our laws and stifle real reform a vast majority of people feel that this country is moving in the wrong direction and we can only bring make real change by electing a congress that will bring the same sense of urgency to shake things up as barack obama has
5852288 speaker silver and members of the assembly have offered a roadmap to solving the very real problem of property taxes that bear no relation to what working and middle class families can afford
5852289 its time to let democracy work its time the state senate notices that more than 15 000 new yorkers reached out to their legislators and the governor to say that the so called property tax cap is nothing more than an arbitrary restriction on local investment in public education that does nothing to address the property tax mess
5852290 the state assembly has taken seriously the charge of providing new yorkers with real property tax relief by adopting a circuit breaker tax cap and reduction plan while the state senate majority is chasing the sound bites and gimmickry of a so called tax cap that reduces nobodys taxes and threatens the quality of our schools the assembly majority has adopted the only plan in albany that actually caps and reduces the property taxes of individual homeowners the assembly has clearly drawn a line at the doorstep of our schools and said that we must provide real property tax relief to homeowners but that we cannot sacrifice the education of our children the state assemblys circuit breaker tax cap and reduction plan is tied to the actual funding needed to reduce property taxes by enacting a small increase in the income taxes paid by millionaires and multi millionaires and it protects the quality of education for years middle and lower income homeowners have been subsidizing tax cuts given to the wealthiest new yorkers by way of the spiraling property taxes that resulted from the state of new york paying too small a share of the costs of educating our school kids now the assembly is insisting that the needs of homeowners and the education of school kids take precedence over putting more money in the pockets of millionaires aqe is thankful for the leadership of speaker silver in saying no to the tax cap gimmick and yes to bona fide property tax relief and quality education

5852293 lenders do not have to rely on headline rates to hook borrowers in at the moment often a great headline rate has come with an extortionate fee but lenders are being much more transparent now about the true cost to the consumer and where their profit comes from
5852294 higher rates might seem unpalatable for some people however those lower fees can make it cheaper for borrowers on a smaller mortgage consumers must look at both the fee and the rate if they want to work out the best deal for them

5852311 we need to start drilling offshore on advanced oil rigs like this one
5852312 new drilling has got to be part of our energy solution
5852313 when im president there will be a whole lot more like them not only here in the gulf but also off of our east and west coasts
5852314 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now

5852322 in the context of the challenges the nation is facing beverly hills is faring very very well
5852323 the upper class those who have a liquid net worth above 1 million are basically immune to economic fluctuations
5852324 lets say you have a net worth of 100 million and you lose half that amount youd still have a net worth of 50 million and youd still go shopping

5852335 we need academic freedom and an ability to talk about these things without fearing legal consequences

5852341 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5852342 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5852343 when we looked at our options two paths lay before us 1 ship the game on time with fewer features and less polish or 2 extend the development cycle and spend the needed time and money to make war great we chose the latter path to invest additional time and effort in implementation and polish to make war great fortunately we have the resources and support of ea behind us to extend our development cycle time that will be used to make sure the game is everything we want it to be war is coming and it will be glorious
5852344 players can get into the north american open beta by pre ordering warhammer online from select retail partners
5852345 why are these people playing wow underneath a warhammer online banner that just doesnt make any ooooooh
5852346 gloomy market conditions have not dampened consumers appetite for shopping online online sales continue to show strong growth particularly when compared to the tough trading conditions on the high street
5852347 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the are leaving their walls
5852348 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that
5852349 i think that russia is looking for a reason to have a serious conflict with ukraine
5852350 cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them
5852351 the cynic that i am makes me wonder if this is just riding on the back of the georgia bigfoot gubbins
5852352 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
5852353 this settlement was reached without any admission of liability on behalf of the city and the individual defendants
5852354 although defendants believe that they would ultimately have prevailed at a trial the costs of going forward weighed in favor of a settlement at this time
5852355 this concludes a successful effort by our division of enforcement to stop fraud in its tracks return as much money as possible to defrauded investors
5852356 in the current economic condition people are driving less and it obviously affects every facet of the u s auto industry including how often they replace tires or buy new cars
5852357 the current economic condition further impacted the stores but they were not performing well before this year and we dont expect them to perform well
5852358 the survivors explained to us that passengers were squeezed together on the bus
5852359 we have no doubt over 50 people died in this catastrophe
5852360 we will never be able to find all those people
5852361 before the water gets to where we could reach them it passes through a place called trou canari where bodies could be stuck
5852362 those who know the area know about trou canari if you fall there there is no way to go and get you you are simply lost forever
5852363 nobody will want to go to those places to search for bodies
5852364 some were trying to call for help but we could not do anything for them those who were saved had a chance to get out through an open back door that was not under water and got on top of the bus
5852365 no one wanted to be left behind everyone wanted to get on board
5852366 i really loved the script and having done harry potter i wanted to do something different it was quite a challenge
5852367 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5852368 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5852369 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5852370 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5852371 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5852372 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5852373 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5852374 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5852375 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5852376 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5852377 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5852378 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5852379 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5852380 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5852381 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5852382 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5852383 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5852384 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5852385 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5852386 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5852387 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5852388 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5852389 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5852390 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5852391 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5852392 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5852393 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5852394 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5852395 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5852396 maybe i should pick up some extra batteries just in case
5852397 the next election has not been scheduled until october of 2009 and who knows mr dion may wish to wait longer than that
5852398 i have to say this has really become quite a soap opera
5852399 they dont need the money this year anymore when a movie overperforms the way dark knight has you really dont need harry potter in the fall
5852400 video red amp meth time 4 sum akshun method man live
5852401 ive been on the side a lot for the past couple of years and you get kind of used to it its going to be nice to get back to the center
5852402 i heard a rumor that jay dissed me at wimbledon so im gonna go on the radio and talk shit fuck that ok so now it doesnt look like he ever said those things so let me renege but you know what lax is hitting stores soon so fuck it im still dropping this diss track but man i love that guy hes my idol
5852403 when we understand that man is the only animal who must create meaning who must open a wedge into neutral nature we already understand the essence of love love is the problem of an animal who must find life create a dialogue with nature in order to experience his own being
5852404 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5852405 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5852406 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5852407 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5852408 im a tit man i would know what to do with a b cup
5852409 really cool and interesting for someone who grew up in the punk rock thing in england and then the early 80s in new york city theres a sound and a feeling thats reminiscent of that
5852410 whats really exciting is what happens once a few of the wilder brighter ones get that out of their system
5852411 it was just like whats that weird shaped thing hit it again there it sounded good to me theres a moment where im going backwards and forwards with this girl because she didnt want to play her erhu a chinese violin in a way that she thought was playing it badly
5852412 i think theres going to be a lot more backwards and forwards before we even know where any of this is going
5852413 they knew they couldnt cancel sonic youth because then theyd have another kind of problem i think maybe china is learning to choose if not the best option then the least worst
5852414 theres a lot of criticism of china for so many reasons that go from human rights to milli vanilli lip syncing in the olympic opening ceremonies i tend to view things a little bit differently to me its all unfolding and the change there isnt going to come with one big pronouncement and a ringing of a liberty bell its tiny incremental change and however it comes the discussion about milli vanilli mcdonalds starbucks or copyright laws its movement
5852415 is hardly a money spinner if someone buys a copy they get a free t shirt and a laminated pass to d 22 that stuff is a pain in the ass to do but its fuelling to the scene it plants a seed
5852416 weve been lucky enough to make legacy of kain eternal darkness too human and if you look at all of those theyre all really different
5852417 thats really whats important and making sure that we continue to make new ips but also continue to innovate in the genres that we try to create content in
5852418 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5852419 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5852420 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5852421 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5852422 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5852423 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5852424 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5852425 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5852426 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5852427 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5852428 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5852429 the victims were all poor laborers and civilians this was a barbaric act carried out by the enemies of afghanistan at a time of celebration of independence
5852430 the terrorists showed that they are vigorously against the freedom of the afghan people and cannot bear to see the celebration of independence and the happiness of the afghan people
5852431 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5852432 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces afghan or coalition and government representatives
5852433 let us shun tribal linguistic and regional issues and wage jihad against the enemies of this country and its religion and their mercenaries so we can mark the independence anniversary in its actual form
5852434 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5852435 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5852436 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5852437 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5852438 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5852439 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5852440 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5852441 as peacekeepers or as human beings members of the russian military are responsible for making sure that the territory that they now occupy is free from these ravages against the local population
5852442 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship with russia but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual
5852443 we will reaffirm the commitment in bucharest and the meeting is also expected to approve a package of measures to support georgia
5852444 he has said it will not solve our problem and that its not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5852445 new drilling has to be part of our energy solution it will not solve this problem alone alternative energy will not solve this problem alone conservation will not solve this problem alone solving our energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
5852446 it will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tidal and biofuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like clean coal nuclear power and offshore drilling like that done on this rig
5852447 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5852448 is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5852449 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5852450 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5852451 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5852452 when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5852453 buffoon of the new millenium could with a straight face
5852454 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5852455 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5852456 u s policy must focus on assuring that all elements of pakistans government are resolute in shutting down the safe havens for al qaeda and the taliban
5852457 the vehicle failed shortly after liftoff and in no way reached its intended position
5852458 theyre not there yet and thats to be expected but this is a step forward that has implications strategically
5852459 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5852460 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5852461 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5852462 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them

5852465 according to devil mountain software inc which operates a community based testing network nearly 35 of the 3 000 plus pcs it examined had been downgraded from vista to xp

5852592 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were very difficult dr forster said
5852593 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5852594 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5852595 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said
5852596 im not the guy im not the one that is going to be barack obamas vp nominee
5852597 its the first chance barack obama is able to regain the national stage michael phelps is going to be old news by tomorrow and the conventions start early next week so this is the prime opportunity for him to start announcing
5852598 senator obama went on vacation last week and he stayed in the news a little bit but not really in the forefront and i think his campaign would really like him to dominate the news as long as possible obviously next week is the democratic national convention and hell be in the news next week but if you do it a few days beforehand you get that extra whoosh
5852599 i think governor kaine definitely adds to that fresh face part of the portfolio and change not washington business as usual governor kaine also has a very interesting record on volunteerism having been a missionary in honduras as well as being the governor of a state and an administrator he is of course from virginia a key battleground state this fall which is going to possibly be the deciding factor in the election so governor kaine brings a lot of things to the table what he doesnt have is a lot of foreign policy experience and that may be a problem in the obama campaign
5852600 were looking at polls that show that people arent quite ready to vote for him they see mccain as more experienced on foreign policy better able to lead in a crisis now i assume the obama campaign is seeing that in their own polling and that would lead you to somebody like senator joseph biden head of the foreign relations committee somebody who has ben in the senate since 1973 and who really has a lot of expertise in foreign policy world
5852601 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5852602 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy

5852643 im a tell you like george bush tole me fuck you n as im out of here
5852644 we will do our team meeting and thats when dean will touch on geelong and i am sure he will touch on gary ablett probably for about half an hour
5852645 whether we try to tackle him or corral him like we did last time i am not too sure but hes going to be hard to stop
5852646 it was one of the better individual games i have been involved in
5852647 when you play you dont tend to notice too many other players simmo adam simpson might get 40 touches and you dont really know but that night ablett had it on a string
5852648 he was running so hard i went to him at a couple of stoppages and the way he moves and shakes his hips you cant tackle him
5852649 it was a great game by him and it was good to be on the same ground
5852650 its pretty tough to go on to a bloke when hes on fire
5852651 its probably the best individual game of the season i will have a big day whether it is him or jim bartel or joel corey or joel selwood
5852652 i was a little bit embarrassed with the amount of attention he got after that game to be honest you feel a bit helpless at times he is that good a player
5852653 you just hope the ball doesnt go into his area because he is that good
5852654 well try to tackle him if we can telstra dome is such a quick ground
5852655 it didnt work for us that well last time he had 40 touches so he probably gets the brownlow votes
5852656 it is pretty clear they are the best side in the competition
5852657 its a joy to watch them most of the time when you are sitting in your lounge room
5852658 i have surprised myself this year that i have been able to keep up with the pace of the afl
5852659 last year i was just under prepared but i have put my head down and worked hard and everything is starting to pay off
5852660 we get a bit bemused by commentators who say they dont think our list is a top four list or that our players dont stack up with top end clubs
5852661 clearly there has been almost a demarcation line with us during the year where against the sides below us weve done ok and against the sides above us we havent done so well
5852662 we drew with the bulldogs when they were in their best form that was a pretty reasonable effort on that particular occasion but i think four quarter wise that was what we were more pleased about
5852663 from start to finish we got the job done the way we wanted to we put a plan in place and the blokes stuck absolutely 100 percent with that
5852664 from a self belief point of view its important for our guys to know that they can compete with sides that have been right up there for the entire year i think thats really important
5852665 from a direction point of view too as much as i can sit here and say i believe in our younger group of players and i think were very even in the group of players coming through for them to actually see it themselves
5852666 even guys who are playing at coburg at the moment a young alex rance goes to that game and says well im not breaking into the side at the moment but when i do break into the side it might be not a bad side to be a part of
5852667 all those sort of things probably help us sell the message to ourselves
5852668 it was my first nude scene and it wasnt supposed to be me
5852669 i had a body double and we had some complicating factors with her
5852670 i was really uncomfortable this crew that id been working with that knows me when i put on my producer hat suddenly sees me naked it was really humiliating
5852671 the children have kept me going after i do playboy we want to try ivf its asking a lot but if its possible it would make our package complete
5852672 i dont regret not going to college if i had gone to college i would never have seen the world i dont know that if i would have went to college id have ended up walking out with a degree so its probably better that i didnt try
5852673 there was a strip club on bourbon street there was one they advertise as live sex shows and i went in there and met a male stripper who said he was straight and that he serviced men and women he was the guy i hung out with most
5852674 on one occasion a guy came in and said to my friend hey man i need you for a job right now
5852675 ive been dying to get tattoos of hall amp oates forever i was like im doing it my hands were swollen and puffy for like two days
5852676 itll be weird to say hey dude i have a tattoo of your face on my hand but everyone knows im a die hard fan
5852677 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28
5852678 i want to tell all young girls to walk around in bikinis all summer because there will be that one day in your twenties when youll eat a hamburger and actually see the hamburger on the side of your leg
5852679 tom is the third ruckman on our list so he is going to come into the team and play this week
5852680 hes going to get a chance to ruck against a really good ruckman in ben hudson and will minson does a little bit so its a great opportunity
5852681 i dont think he warnock has been affected by what appears to be an ambush
5852682 we just put forward ourcase and said if youre thinking of leaving hopefully consider us
5852683 it is private property if people were cool this would not be an issue
5852684 this is an outrage its a real slap in the face to all the communities who use it
5852685 simply keeping a lid on 90210 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5852686 since my first year in congress representing the 14th district i have managed my office in a frugal manner instructing staff to provide the greatest possible service to the people of the 14th district at the least possible cost to taxpayers
5852687 it is customary that several thousand dollars of expenditures are not calculated until after this year ends but i am confident that tens of thousands will remain to be given back once the books finally close on 2007 just as congressman paul always instructs us to do
5852688 considering congressman pauls efforts helped to land nearly 50 000 000 in appropriations for crucial projects in this part of texas last year we are most pleased that we were able to once again get the job done under budget
5852689 t he strongest opponent of the act among presidential candidates is ron paul who has taken every opportunity to warn of the creation of a national id card and the threat to individual privacy facing americans as a result of enactment of real id ron paul is the only presidential candidate who has consistently raised the issue of the real id act in presidential debates this year
5852690 isnt a glossy matinee idol or a smooth talking partisan hack but a phd rhodes scholar lesbian policy wonk who started as a prison aids activist
5852691 the things that were said in front of my client were hurtful and once they knew he had a problem with it they should have stopped
5852692 i kept begging them over and over again get off of me and they wouldnt stop
5852693 be it resolved that the republican party is the party of the open door ours is the party of liberty the party of equality of opportunity for all and favoritism for none
5852694 restrict the ability of government agencies to force the sale of private property for projects deemed beneficial to the public
5852695 would ultimately delay projects and the metropolitan water district of southern california has also voiced opposition
5852696 lets just pretend you never had this baby in the first place
5852697 its a slow technology to evolve with just 5 to 10 percent improvement per year
5852698 manufacturers have tried to make better ones but barring the development of a tiny nuclear power generator for mobile devices there isnt much they can do
5852699 ive been working on this for 10 years and there are a lot of issues such as the need to get oxygen into the cell and get created water vapor out of the device but its a very compelling option
5852700 rim has done a really good job at optimizing its systems to get very good battery efficiency and their battery is a hallmark in that sense
5852701 you can access the web watch television and movies listen to music and do so many wonderful things but if the battery is dead when you need to make a call you are in trouble
5852702 battery life should have improved during the last several years
5852703 it hasnt this is one area that has seemed to be ignored
5852704 batteries have always been lacking and always behind the device evolution
5852705 people want the larger displays they want the 3g radio connectivity and that all demands power
5852706 some groups are looking at using mirrored light and even solar energy in reducing the power drain with displays
5852707 are spending a lot of research and development money with partners on improving battery life
5852708 its the double edge sword in that users want things but there are trade offs
5852709 nirvana would be a device staying powered for days that would be a huge success story in this industry

5852732 johnny was the most creative of the trumpeters from the ska period
5852733 the rocker a movie that is otherwise the equivalent of generic rock
5852734 fish fishman a man who has had to tamp down his dream to be a rock n roll star for 20 years but
5852735 the rocker is pretty imaginary but dumber acts have become real hits because of the video web site
5852736 high school musical casting so watching wilson work his lunacy as fish is the real fun
5852737 the rocker seems mostly aimed at tweeners geiger is a bit of a youth heartthrob with wilson as comic relief
5852738 the rocker didnt give wilson more support but then drum solos can only carry you so far
5852739 since then other people have joined and given feedback which is great i want more of that
5852740 oh and by the way i was totally lying there are only 3 ladies and their really nice so calm down hope you get it
5852741 might be good but will be unlistenable 10 a m to 3 p m so i wont be listening

5852749 im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
5852750 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5852751 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt
5852752 this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance
5852753 im out of contract and there has been so much talk about how the club is going with a youth policy i understand that so from my point of view ive got to look at it as though these could be my last two games with melbourne
5852754 im really keen to play at another club next year if it goes that way my preference would be to stay at melbourne but with the youth policy i figure that might not happen
5852755 i think its pretty evident to everyone out there but its just a matter of what they want to decide at the end of the day ill enjoy my footy over the next two weeks and then see what happens i just want to play
5852756 i reckon ive got at least another one or two years left in me
5852757 this year including games with sandy vfl affiliate sandringham ive averaged the most possessions ive had in my career
5852758 my bodys fine i love training i love preparing my body ive got a lot of motivation and i love playing footy
5852759 i played 100 games straight and missed the game against hawthorn with a back problem apart from getting dropped ive played every game with sandy i feel like ive still got a lot in me and i can offer a lot
5852760 theres no animosity towards melbourne whatsoever theyve been a great club and i love them to death but i want to play on and if its not going to be with the red and blue i want to go somewhere else
5852761 ive been working with the younger guys and i enjoy doing that sort of stuff its something jimmy stynes did for me when i first came to the club and later with sam newman i really fed off the information i got from those two and earlier from a guy named percy johnson in perth
5852762 the teachings ive had id love to give to someone else
5852763 fighting to become part of the system here in england the traditions and whatnot though as the show progresses he slowly starts to understand them and embraces them
5852764 booth at first hates it but then he kind of turns around
5852765 says deschanel explaining that brennan a more sophisticated world traveler has an easier time of it working overseas
5852766 thats when our show is the best when people have to reveal their feelings in some way but we never get sentimental
5852767 hepburn and tracy kind of thing the witty stylish fond but confrontational relationship of brennan and booth
5852768 i think going into season four this should be the mark of what our show is you put these two characters in a misplaced environment thats where they operate best thats what brings out the best in their relationship
5852769 we are getting very good production value weve shot in places you cant believe we shot in front of the bank of england we are going to shoot right near tower bridge i thought it would be just a distant thing but its this close
5852770 i think one of the best parts has been working with the actors here the talent pool is gigantic
5852771 this convention in denver is one is which people well known and people not as well known will come together across party lines across geographic divides because they believe in change
5852772 his message all along is that the ideas have to come from the people
5852773 my voice shakes when i speak in front of 50 people at work at a meeting
5852774 when i saw that motorcade come down the cul de sac i couldnt speak i couldnt swallow within a couple minutes he put us at so much ease
5852775 im just a poor railroader ive got a small house and a family im trying to raise barack and michelle can relate to that because of their upbringing
5852776 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
5852777 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
5852778 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know

5852847 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5852848 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5852849 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5852850 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5852851 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5852852 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5852853 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo

5852864 happy hearts and happy faces happy play in grassy places that was how in ancient ages children grew to kings and sages
5852865 i believe the nicest and sweetest days are not those on which anything splendid or wonderful or exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures following one another softly like pearls slipping off a string
5852866 i am waiting for you vizzini you told me to go back to the beginning so i have this is where i am and this is where ill stay i will not be moved
5852867 love is like quicksilver in the hand leave the fingers open and it stays clutch it and it darts away
5852868 follow your heart but be quiet for a while first ask questions then feel the answer learn to trust your heart
5852869 its not so much that were afraid of change or so in love with the old ways but its that place in between that we fear its like being between trapezes its linus when his blanket is in the dryer theres nothing to hold on to
5852870 in my heart i didnt think id medal but then i did
5852871 i think once nathan deakes and jana rawlinson had gone i think the pressure was off the medals a bit but weve always had a youth policy
5852872 we say were in a rebuilding phase we are in a rebuilding phase and this is really icing on the cake
5852873 shes progressed very quickly and i think gone way ahead of where i think even she expected to be
5852874 twelve months ago i dont think shed be dreaming of it well she might have been dreaming of it but thats all it would have been
5852875 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5852876 its just a shame that it was on the biggest race of my life
5852877 the hurdles were just coming up very fast and i just told myself what i always tell myself keep things tight
5852878 but its kind of like when you are racing a car and going max velocity and you hit a curve either you can maintain control or you can crash and burn today i crashed and burned
5852879 you have certain people that are supposed to be the favourites
5852880 on this particular day and at this time you have to run your best race
5852881 its anyones race we do hurdles and they come at you really fast you have to execute your race
5852882 ken schrader has a lot of experience at bristol and we felt with as competitive as the field will be this weekend he gives us the best chance to be successful
5852883 brad coleman will test for us next week at kansas speedway and we plan on having brad compete in more races throughout the remainder of the year we look forward to working with brad as he continues to gain experience at the sprint cup level
5852884 i think the us economy can be defined in recession
5852885 its a fairly shallow recession but certainly we do have weakness across most of the economy employment is falling and unfortunately in the us they do their definition of recession somewhat differently

5852897 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5852907 if we refuse to pattern our exegesis after that of the apostles we are in practice denying the authoritative character of their scriptural interpretation and to do so is to strike at the very heart of the christian faith
5852908 we not only can reproduce their exegetical methodology we must if we are to be taught their understanding of holy scripture
5852909 anything else than the apostles hermeneutic is based on speculative human reasoning
5852910 torn between following the objective methods that we espouse in theory or following the lead of the authors of scripture and utilizing the methods they model
5852911 because something is done a certain way does not mandate it as right or the only way
5852912 the new testament writers used the old testament at different times in different ways for different reasons
5852913 there is no such thing as the nt pattern of ot usage
5852914 while there is some truth to the assertion that the new testament practice of interpreting the old testament should inform our own interpretation we should be very cautious about suggesting deeper meanings in the text that are not clearly enunciated within scripture
5852915 much like the speech of a person raised on the classics will be sprinkled with terminology and idioms drawn from those texts new testament writers often without intending to provide a correct interpretation of the old testament text use old testament language as a vehicle of expression
5852916 these casual references would reveal nothing about their exegetical method
5852917 nt authors never claim to have engaged in a hermeneutical process nor do they claim that they can support their findings from the text they claim inspiration
5852918 does the old testament type have a genuinely predictive function or is typology simply a way of looking back at the old testament and drawing out resemblances
5852919 did not get their typological correspondence from their exegetical analysis of the context of the ot
5852920 since this correlation is not identifiable until both type and anti type exist typology is always a function of hindsight one thing is never identified as a type of something to come only after the latter has come can the correspondence be proclaimed
5852921 we cannot speak of reproducing the methods of the nt authors for the subjectivity of their methods is not allowed to those of us whose interpretation does not enjoy the affirmation of inspiration
5852922 we do not wish to reproduce the hermeneutics of nt authors because they by virtue of inspiration accrued authority to themselves by means unavailable to us
5852923 it is not necessary to claim that we have to have such inspiration to reproduce their method or their conclusions the fact that we dont have the same revelatory stance as the new testament writers only means that we cannot have the same epistemological certainty about our interpretation conclusions and applications as they had
5852924 if they declare that a particular prophecy was fulfilled in a particular way shouldnt we accept that declaration as the proper understanding of that prophecy and shouldnt our acceptance of the apostles conclusions inform the rest of our interpretation of prophecy
5852925 if i had more time youd really see how smart i am
5852926 the messianic sense that matthew saw in the words of hos 11 1 out of egypt i have called my son was already there in the book of hosea matthew did not invent it he better than we understood the sensus literalis intended by the historical author of the book of hosea
5852927 for what did christ atone in isa 53 4 5
5852928 if you are able to meet all my righteous requirements on your own i still wont save you because good works and perfect dispositions are not what i am looking for
5852929 but now a righteousness has been made known apart from the law
5852930 am i properly understanding the following to be an important underlying assumption in your hermeneutic 1 the meanings of prophetic texts were in general naturally clear to their original audiences
5852931 and in that day the lord will be king over all the earth in that day the lord will be the only one and his name the only one all the land will be changed into a plain from geba to rimmon south of jerusalem but jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from benjamins gate as far as the place of the first gate to the corner gate and from the tower of hananel to the kings wine presses people will live in it and there will no longer be a curse for jerusalem will dwell in security
5852932 a literal time in the future a literal kingdom a literal transformation of the land a literal jerusalem and a literal population living in security
5852933 it seems the apostle s misunderstood jesus and jesus says israel misunderstood the prophecy of the ot they expected a king and he constantly tells them no not now
5852934 lord is it at this time you are restoring the kingdom to israel
5852935 it is not for you to know the times or the epochs which the father has fixed by his own authority
5852936 you are wrong to expect that the kingdom will be restored to israel
5852937 it is not for you to know when that restoration will take place
5852938 the deliverer will come from zion he will remove ungodliness from jacob this is my covenant with them when i take away their sins
5852939 nate are you implying that these five elements are each distinctive to dispensationalism
5852940 evangelicals and the use of the old testament in the new
5852941 there is in fact no important distinction to be made at all between meaning and application and so i shall use them interchangeably
5852942 for their minds were hardened for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth it not being revealed to them that it is done away in christ
5852943 o foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken behooved it not the christ to suffer these things and to enter into his glory and beginning from moses and from all the prophets he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself
5852944 these are my words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the law of moses and the prophets and the psalms concerning me then opened he their mind that they might understand the scriptures
5852945 they often gave a spiritual meaning or a new application to an old testament text without denying that what the original said literally did or will happen
5852946 procedure is not simply to interpret the old by the new as covenant theology insists there is no need to conclude that the new testament changes or reinterprets the old testament
5852947 an approach such as this contributes to a consistently literal hermeneutic and demonstrates why many dispensationalists still believe that older approaches to interpretation are to be preferred as opposed to progressive approaches how the old testament is used in the new is no basis on which to abandon or modify a consistently literal hermeneutic
5852948 if a given passage contains many uses of figurative language everything in that passage should be taken symbolically instead of literally
5852949 john doesnt mean what he says he means he saw their bodies come to life
5852950 what about it where exactly is the nation israel in
5852951 you know in acts 2 peter doesnt preach one gospel to israel and say
5852952 the nation israel played the same kind of role in history that for example the ark played or the sacrifice of abel played which is it points to the actual work of christ and does not have some stand alone meaning based on the incomplete canon of revelation extent when those events were happening
5852953 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

5852955 you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain
5852956 all things in the church must be done properly and in an orderly manner
5852957 adorn the doctrine of god our savior in every respect
5852958 let us offer to god acceptable worship with reverence and awe for our god is a consuming fire
5852959 while maintaining a proper respect for god biblical worship is always brimming with personal passion and christ exalting emotion
5852960 a sow after washing returns to wallowing in the mire
5852961 sincere christians can disagree about the details of scripture and theology absolutely
5852962 christians do not need to take every verse of the bible literally
5852963 while graham believes scripture is the inspired authoritative word of god he does not read the bible as though it were a collection of associated press bulletins straightforwardly reporting on events in the ancient middle east
5852964 im not a literalist in the sense that every single jot and tittle is from the lord
5852965 this is a little difference in my thinking through the years
5852966 graham is arguing that the bible is open to interpretation and fair minded christians may disagree or come to a different conclusion about specific points
5852967 ive been watching the news from the middle east full time i think that history began there and it is going to end there the whole bible is centered in the middle east and so many of the events that are taking place in some ways already have taken place many times and my heart goes out to all those people who are suffering on all sides i pray for those people on my mind theyre on my heart i pray that somehow they will find a solution christ who i believe is going to come back will settle all of those things in a great period of righteousness
5852968 still unequivocally committed to the gospel but increasingly thinks gods ways and means are veiled from human eyes and wrapped in mystery
5852969 as time went on i began to realize the love of god for everybody all over the world and in his death on the cross some mysterious thing happened between god and the son that we dont understand but there he was alone taking on the sins of the world
5852970 when asked whether he believes heaven will be closed to good jews muslims buddhists hindus or secular people
5852971 do you believe in the jesus of the bible as the only savior from sin
5852972 is far from questioning the fundamentals of the faith he is not saying jesus is just another lifestyle choice nor is he backtracking on essentials such as the incarnation or the atonement
5852973 i have a lot of friends who are islamic there are many wonderful people among them i have a great love for them i have spoken at islamic meetings in nigeria and in different parts of the world
5852974 not many of us should become teachers my brothers for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness
5852975 faithful are the wounds of a friend profuse are the kisses of an enemy
5852976 i believe that god demonstrates love toward every one of his creatures
5852977 heaven will be closed to good jews muslims buddhists hindus or secular people he said and i quote him
5852978 in the morning in the morning in the morning hours in the morning in the morning in the morning hours
5852979 what am i supposed to be thinking about right now
5852980 holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory isaiah 6 3
5852981 hmmm ive got the line this is the air i breathe what should come next how about this is the air i breathe perfect
5852982 it would break my heart to ever lose each other
5852983 optimistically hoping for a substantial articulation as to why someone who is sympathetic to wright believes the anglican bishop has been misunderstood by those who are critical of him
5852984 i wasnt intending to make arguments against the claims of wrights critics
5852985 if someone dismissed the arguments of people like duncan waters and carson on account of my post they would be committing this error nevertheless there is a time and a place for discussing peoples motives and influences even though we are not justified in dismissing their arguments on such a basis
5852986 wow this is one of the best things i have read on the internet in sometime it is articulate measured and accurate
5852987 it is obvious that you are not persuading anyone your arguments even your best arguments are simply alienating people
5852988 n t wright misunderstands paul because he is 1 lazy 2 impatient 3 unloving 4 militant 5 arrogant 6 historically na ve 7 prone to peer pressure 8 power hungry 9 angry 10 hopelessly preconditioned and 11 incompetent
5852989 i can see then why you would find my criticism of the article so aggravating
5852990 because ad hominems no matter whom they target are always illegitimate forms of argumentation
5852991 what he says must be false because he is lazy and stupid
5852992 im sure some of your other posts are full of substance and careful scholarship but those articles cannot somehow legitimize the fallacious argumentation used in this one
5852993 wrights critics seem to have an incredibly difficult time understanding him since they so frequently misrepresent what he has written as i have documented repeatedly i wondered why this could happen so dramatically and so frequently these are the reasons why i think this happens
5852994 if wright is correct then the reformation was all a big mistake and misunderstanding my forebears died for the reformation and youre saying that smart guys like luther and calvin didnt get the gospel right either who do you think you are to challenge our heroes of the faith
5852995 i cant see any way out of where wrights trajectory is going to go rome liberalism therefore even though he says things which deny he will go towards doctrine x i will claim he is teaching doctrine x
5852996 truly reformed people dont have such a blithe connection to biblical doctrine

5853032 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
5853033 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
5853034 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
5853035 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate

5853054 in subsequent years we will see reduced growth but the fundamentals remain strong emerging regions replacement of obsolete systems and some technology shifts are driving growth
5853055 enterprises are switching from company owned hardware and software assets to per use service based models this will impact the industry in various ways
5853056 the projected shift to cloud computing for example will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas he added that assets in general will be utilized with greater efficiency and the overall effect on market growth will be neutral
5853057 most companies updated their software systems during the period 1997 through 2001 so we are in the middle of an upgrade cycle that should extend past the end of this decade
5853058 however the replacement of systems doesnt automatically equate to new software market growth
5853059 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cellphones and music

5853065 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5853066 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5853067 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5853068 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5853069 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5853070 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5853071 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5853072 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5853073 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5853074 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5853075 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5853076 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5853077 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5853078 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5853079 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5853080 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5853081 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5853082 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5853083 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5853084 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5853085 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5853086 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5853087 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5853088 no israel forfeited its kingdom in the execution of the messiah the church is the new israel we are the israel of god there is no literal kingdom everything is spiritual
5853089 what is the significance of israels return to the land today
5853090 the other perspective is whats called non dispensational or covenant theology which has no place for israel no kingdom in the future and essentially spiritualizes everything in prophetic literature rather than making it literal
5853091 everybody is a dispensationalist everybody i dont care who they are in theology theyre dispensational its only a question of how many you have
5853092 now in the ot repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly the bible says god has a place for the nation israel
5853093 everybody is a dispensationalist everybody i dont care who they are in theology theyre dispensational its only a question of how many you have
5853094 the real distinctive in dispensational teaching is a consistent literal interpretation of the text of scripture
5853095 everybody is a dispensationalist everybody i dont care who they are in theology theyre dispensational its only a question of how many you have
5853096 a consistent ly literal interpretation of the text of scripture
5853097 everybody is a dispensationalist everybody i dont care who they are in theology theyre dispensational its only a question of how many you have
5853098 the real distinctive in dispensational teaching is a consistent literal interpretation of the text of scripture
5853099 everybody is a dispensationalist everybody i dont care who they are in theology theyre dispensational its only a question of how many you have
5853100 a consistent ly literal interpretation of the text of scripture
5853101 now what it boils down to in dispensational theology is that we believe that when god says something he means it and he means exactly what he said and we dont want to take the liberty to spiritualize it
5853102 dispensationalism by the way is simply a title for theology that recognizes a literal nation israel to be restored in the future and recognizes a literal kingdom and a literal tribulation and a literal return and a literal rapture
5853103 and thats all that dispensationalism affirms the covenant theologian admits pre fall post fall pre cross post cross and eternity all we want to do is get kingdom in there and if you have a literal kingdom then youre going to have a literal beginning of the kingdom and then youre going to have a literal return and a literal tribulation and then a literal rapture thats all and we do this again because such naturally results from the consistent application of a literal hermeneutic
5853104 the troubling thing to me and the thing that i think is the most helpful in dr
5853105 thats not a mischaracterization thats where dispensationalism always leads just like arminianism always leads to a gospel of works and antinomianism
5853106 so if i am contradicting dr macarthurs statement then so did he contradict himself in the context of the same answer to the same question this goes back to the first point we must interpret the meaning of a statement in the way the speaker or writer intended it to be understood if we by our interpretation force someone to contradict himself in a matter of a few sentences we are then accusing him of being schizophrenic
5853107 law was not the major thrust but gods grace was the major thrust so already you have at least three dispensations and what happens in the eternal state now you have four
5853108 i am the lord your god who took you out of egypt covenant language of grace therefore do this
5853109 i can see why john macarthur left bob jones university may it be that god is praised he left such a stuffy irrelevant backwards insitution of wanna be theologians and monstrocities of legalism
5853110 matt are you a post millennialist or a covenant pre mil the standard covenant position does not hold to a future literal millennial kingdom if you are referring to the eternal state e g new heavens and new earth then we are talking about something different altogether
5853111 every mother and father should look in the mirror and ask themselves if they are doing the parenting essential to help their child negotiate the difficult teen years free of tobacco alcohol and drugs
5853112 it is inexcusable that so many parents fail to appropriately monitor their children fail to keep dangerous prescription drugs out of the reach of their children and tolerate drug infected schools
5853113 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5853114 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5853115 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5853116 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5853117 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5853118 we knew all a along there were more people it wouldnt surprise me if more people came forward next week
5853119 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposure while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched
5853120 i cant even be up there with her because every time i fly up there it costs us 600 to 700 return
5853121 so obviously that is money that could keep her up there for another week or two
5853122 i dont expect them to pay the full amount but there should be a program to pay half or a percentage something
5853123 this doesnt happen very often where we get this kind of request so if we open up for one we are afraid it will open a floodgate for others and we just cant go down that road
5853124 there are programs that these organizations have not sure about lung transplants but funds are available in some incidents
5853125 i cant believe that the government is just completely washing its hands of it

5853131 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5853132 truth is that social media is the responsibility of the champions that demonstrate how it will benefit the company and the brand
5853133 what is really frustrating is to have a second devastating fire occur in the same area under basically the same conditions despite the amount of information that has been made available over the years through public education programs that promote defensible space
5853134 i wish they would recommend people would clean up their sage brush in their backyard
5853135 a garden hose like that doesnt do anything against a fire like that

5853150 edgy and intensely heated this cowboy story is especially good alison kent never fails to deliver
5853151 writings not rocket science its a helluva lot harder because once you learn all that rocket science crap you can at least in theory build a rocket on the other hand you can read every writing book known to man and attend classes and work with critique partners and get pages of editorial input and still end up with a book that doesnt quite hit the high notes scary but true
5853152 can i be blunt on this subject if you dont have time to read you dont have the time or the tools to write simple as that reading is the creative center of a writers life
5853153 you know im a storyteller we are storytellers and ours is an ancient tradition contemporized by the cinema and the capturing of light and we should all be very proud of our place in society on any given night millions of people across the world buy a ticket for adventures that only we as storytellers can provide we release burdens we galvanize emotions we make people laugh we make people talk over breakfast this is a great job and i want to encourage every one of you in this room to give everything you can to the story god bless narrative god bless originality

5853156 my new years resolution is to focus on the book and forget all the crap that surrounds the writing business to lose myself in a story and not give a damn if it makes any lists has a good sell through gets glowing reviews on amazon pleases my editors hell even pleases my readers i want to love what im writing so much that none of the rest of it matters and if i dont i wont write it lifes too short to abuse the muse
5853157 america is now wholly given over to a d d mob of scribbling women and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash and should be ashamed of myself if i did succeed what is the mystery of these innumberable editions of the lamplighter by maria susanna cummins and other books neither better nor worse worse they could not be and better they need not be when they sell by the hundred thousand
5853158 as for my next book i am going to hold myself from writing it till i have it impending in me grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear pendant gravid asking to be cut or it will fall
5853159 the storyteller is deep inside everyone of us the story maker is always with us let us suppose our world is attacked by war by the horrors that we all of us easily imagine let us suppose floods wash through our cities the seas rise but the storyteller will be there for it is our imaginations which shape us keep us create us for good and for ill it is our stories that will recreate us when we are torn hurt even destroyed it is the storyteller the dream maker the myth maker that is our phoenix that represents us at our best and at our most creative

5853180 the law of the lord is perfect restoring the soul
5853181 thou didst hide these things from the wise and intelligent and didst reveal them to babes
5853182 the testimony of the lord is sure making wise the simple
5853183 there is much truth in the remark of clement of alexandria no scripture i apprehend is so favorably treated as to be contradicted by no one
5853184 without faith it is impossible to please him for he who comes to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him
5853185 if christ has not been raised then our preaching is vain your faith also is vain
5853186 if you confess with your mouth jesus as lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you shall be saved
5853187 now to the one who works his wage is not reckoned as a favor but as what is due but to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly his faith is reckoned as righteousness
5853188 for not knowing about gods righteousness and seeking to establish their own they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of god
5853189 christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes
5853190 if we say that we have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness we lie and do not practice the truth
5853191 if we say that we have no sin we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us
5853192 if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us
5853193 if anyone does not love the lord let him be accursed
5853194 every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is from god and every spirit that does not confess jesus is not from god and this is the spirit of the antichrist
5853195 for many deceivers have gone out into the world those who do not acknowledge jesus christ as coming in the flesh this is the deceiver and the antichrist
5853196 no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid which is jesus christ
5853197 rightly did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written this people honors me with their lips but their heart is far away from me but in vain do they worship me teaching as doctrines the precepts of men neglecting the commandment of god you hold to the tradition of men you nicely set aside the commandment of god in order to keep your tradition
5853198 christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes
5853199 anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of christ does not have god the one who abides in the teaching he has both the father and the son
5853200 and no wonder for even satan disguises himself as an angel of light therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness

5853271 the more i thought about it i realized that before you can get unity you need reconciliation i know how hard it is to come to an evening like this while you had a different story in your head that had a different ending
5853272 i held grudges from the 1980 campaign for way too long
5853273 there are a lot of gaps that still need to be closed
5853274 they would say we dont like so and so then suddenly the race is over and we all have to love so and so
5853275 it didnt have sonia winning but it did show that she could close the gap
5853276 in a lot of ways this has been a two year campaign for her
5853277 i cant say sonias definitely going to win but i like the results
5853278 stayed in their denominations as long as they could to purge out the doctrinal heresy then tolerated and advocated
5853279 staying in the bgc can be seen as a calling to work toward reform rather than an endorsement of the present move in the wrong direction one church can make a difference in prayer and labor especially when teamed up with other like minded churches
5853280 the disagreement is in the matter of wise application not over the principle
5853281 what i am saying is that baptist fundamentalists typically do separation too well they separate over things that are not really fundamental
5853282 when you received the word of god which you heard from us you accepted it
5853283 idleness would not seem to be a fundamental issue but a rather secondary one a rather minor issue when compared to the great doctrines of the faith we can say however that the ildness was in the thessalonian case clear disobedience so i ask you is the standard that we separate over only fundamental issues or is it simply any non repentant pattern of disobedience of any kind
5853284 the other consideration that argues for a broader application of pauls commanded separation is simply logical if paul commands separation from a brother who will not work for his living how much more so would he expect it from a brother guilty of some kind of immorality or unorthodoxy in other words if the lesser kind of disobedience is grounds for withdrawal of fellowship by logical extension so is the greater kind of disobedience
5853285 does that mean that a church that believes the nt clearly requires head coverings would need to separate from those churches that do not obey this clear teaching
5853286 separation from apostates is clearly taught in scripture it is a biblical mandate
5853287 separation from other godly christian leaders with whom we disagree on their own application of separation is something altogether different
5853288 the problem wasnt a debate about application it was about the biblical mandate
5853289 we also teach that separation from all religious apostasy and worldly and sinful practices is commanded of us by god romans 12 1 2 1 corinthians 5 9 13 2 corinthians 6 14 7 1 1 john 2 15 17 2 john 9 11
5853290 there are ministries in america which champion the original fundamentals of the faith and yet are ostracized by contemporary fundamentalism
5853291 while i dont necessarily disagree with camps comments i dont know that i would have stated them in quite that way
5853292 are there any conservative christian commentaries who see this application as the primary understanding of the passage
5853293 does what paul writes about dealing with disobedient brothers in the local church have any legitimate application to the ecclesiastical challenges we face
5853294 perceived implication that goes beyond the authorial intent of the passage
5853295 whether others do so or not i have felt the power of the text come out from among them and be ye separate
5853296 i simply see no biblical warrant for trying to have a voice in the mainstream
5853297 to magnify the sumpremacy of god and the transforming power of the gospel of jesus christ through the making and maturing of disciples who will effect spiritual social and cultural renewal in the city of denver and around the world
5853298 thus says the lord of hosts the god of israel to all the exiles whom i have sent into exile from jerusalem to babylon build houses and live in them plant gardens and eat their produce take wives adn have sons and daughters take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage that they may bear sons and daughters multiply there and do not decrease but seek the welfare of the city where i have sent you into exile and pray to the lord on its behalf for in its welfare you will find your welfare
5853299 no more let sins and sorrows grow nor thorns infest the ground he comes to make his blessings flow far as the curse is found
5853300 to all the exiles whom i have sent into exile from jerusalem to babylon
5853301 proclaim the blessings of the gospel to every part of our culture
5853302 yet in spite of this affirmation our ministry is not usually embraced in fundamentalist circles we like most fundamentalists are quick to separate from apostates and even from those who directly link with apostates like billy graham
5853303 where we differ with typical fundamentalism i believe is at the third and fourth degree separation levels if i can even speak of such levels of biblical separation we find primary separation explicitly taught in the new testament it is therefore a non negotiable for us but we do not find secondary or tertiary separation explicitly taught in the new testament
5853304 biblical warrant for local church ministry that transforms or renews the culture is not found
5853305 you are the salt of the earth you are the light of the world let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father who is in heaven
5853306 tell everybody the romans road and they will bring glory to god
5853307 beloved i urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh which wage war against your soul keep your conduct among the gentiles honorable so that when they speak against you as evildoers they may see your good deeds and glorify god on the day of visitation
5853308 and now you even have evangelical churches that are designing their churches to make unbelievers comfortable

5853324 repentance is never presented in the nt as a condition for eternal life
5853325 we must be exceedingly careful what we say if anything about repentance the simplest course would be to say nothing about repentance
5853326 if an unbeliever decides to turn from his sins in order to get right with god then he will be more open to the gospel
5853327 repent and get right with god in a non saving way because he has fixed a day in which he will judge the world through his son
5853328 therefore god is now declaring to men that all everywhere should repent because he has fixed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness
5853329 but some men joined him and believed among whom also were dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them
5853330 to both jews and greeks of repentance toward god and faith in our lord jesus christ
5853331 we must be exceedingly careful what we say if anything about repentance the simplest course would be to say nothing about repentance
5853332 the bible clearly teaches that gods love for his people is of such magnitude that even those who walk away from the faith have not the slightest chance of slipping from his hand

5853366 its a good business decision for the regional economy as well as for the rest of quebec
5853367 given more affluent customer base was not the target of the fiscal stimulus we are not expecting a material benefit from the rebates
5853368 its a small positive but you still have all the other negatives
5853369 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge
5853370 during these tough times some of our consumers dont want to be tempted as much as they have in the past
5853371 its not like they need to do this to try and raise the cash to pay off debt or something
5853372 its 174 million theyre well capitalized theres no issues with their balance sheet theyre in great shape
5853373 you dont have that debt of owning that store but you also dont own the store and if you want to make wholesale changes to the store its up to the landlord if theyre going to let you do that
5853374 a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5853375 its been demonstrated that having viral videos to get people involved in things that were traditionally thought of as wonky inside the beltway issues turned out to be very effective
5853376 the people who are online looking at these videos and issues are more politically aware they follow the blogs and are much more likely to take part in online petitions or send e mails to their congressman the people who are online get wifi on steroids it will get them their online videos faster or in the first place
5853377 we just hope that the commission reviews its testing procedures and realizes whats at stake here is the ability of 110 million american households to watch clear tv pictures i dont think americans are going to tolerate their tv screens freezing up just to keep microsoft and google happy

5853380 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua

5853382 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5853383 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5853384 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental

5853387 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5853388 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

5853390 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5853391 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5853392 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5853393 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5853394 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5853395 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

5853398 not everyone in the archives is running vista but out of the sample set of vista capable population and those that shipped with vista in the less than 1 000 pc range what were seeing is two thirds of those systems still have vista installed one third of them have been modified to run xp at this date
5853399 we have a community of mostly enterprise customers our original product platform hails out of our work with the financial services industry our tools are installed throughout many wall street firms and the larger ones have been using it to monitor workstations for several years
5853400 we have a pretty accurate snapshot of whats going on with these machines at a given time
5853401 it was just simple comparison if the machine previously had one of the vista flavors it is a clear example of a machine that has been downgraded directly by the end user or by their it organization in a larger firm or a request to the manufacturer to exercise their downgrade option
5853402 over 180 million windows vista licenses have been sold since launch
5853403 pretty diverse with a lot of large firms and is international in its scope
5853404 what were seeing is fairly representative of the enterprise space
5853405 the user feedback and customer feedback that has been reported over the last year or so is that large organizations are bypassing vista or delaying its adoption or debating whether to stick with windows xp consumers will take anything that ships with their systems where we see resistance to vista is in the bread and butter enterprise data center managed and controlled environments of corporate america and the world

5853441 a blind trust businesswise is not very different from this grantor trust but youre taxed on passive income versus income
5853442 identification of each trust asset if known to the beneficiary from which income was received by the beneficiary in excess of 500

5853450 this document is a very clear statement that this alliance nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union in achieving a europe that is whole free and at peace is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5853451 the way nato assesses the fulfilment of this condition is biased they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side

5853458 a lot of those thoughts about pulling the pin and quitting came very close to the accident and i think that was because of the emotional state and the realisation of just how serious my accident was
5853459 there was something in me that i just wanted to get back on the bike and as soon as i threw my leg over the bike for the first time even though i could only pedal for one to two minutes i felt so uplifted after that first session on the bike and it just made me want to get back on it again and again
5853460 it has been seven months of emotional high and its been so draining
5853461 but ive made an effort not to get too fussed over it and work really hard
5853462 i have worked really hard to get here and im really proud of this silver medal
5853463 you know when an olympic dream goes out the window its very easy for people to turn and walk away

5853482 i feel very good the future looks really good for filmmakers film arts was in a fragile condition and unlike similar arts organizations in other cities where leading local film organizations have just been snuffed out film arts is going through an orderly transitional phase we worked very hard for that
5853483 i have a lot of warm feelings for film arts when i stumbled onto the bay area film scene i knew nothing i had edited a film together but i didnt know what to do with it i dont know if i would be where i am today without film arts
5853484 for years i have felt a desire to uncover something buried inside i am pulled in two directions by life i know something of what the two directions look like my mothers side a side filled with joy and light and my stern and severe aunts filled with darkness repression and judgment sometimes it is as if i am both those people the forces are stronger than i can understand and the directions both a part of me sometimes make me feel a house divided

5853495 the most dangerous thing most of us will ever do
5853496 statistically driving in the u s gets safer every year

5853645 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5853646 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states

5853649 in many ways the work of a critic is easy we risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment we thrive on negative criticism which is fun to write and to read but the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so

5853659 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5853660 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5853661 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over

5853663 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5853664 i really want this to be about making the delegate experience better
5853665 its new technology so people are always going to be wary to some extent but the fact is we cant track delegates from satellites we cant even track them more than six metres from an antenna
5853666 were also limited by the laws of physics people moving through a conference are vastly different from boxes moving along a production line where you can control speed spacing and direction
5853667 these are some of the fun and games scenarios weve been playing around with
5853668 weve now got an application that we can plug any hardware rfid device into
5853669 in fact the fixed and mobile readers all interface into the same system technology and code base this means that if im from an rfid world i can build out a mobile rfid component without too much upskill or needing to reprogram in a separate language
5853670 each door is manned by its own local system which can be run in isolation these also drive the displays in each room
5853671 we did our initial processing with a centralised model but our concern was if the network went down we still wanted to be able to read people going in or out of the doors so we settled on 34 localised rfid server systems
5853672 we want to dispel some of the myths about rfid
5853673 we want to inspire people to get to rooms quickly and get seats when they see them filling up in real time
5853674 we also want to really inspire them to see what can be done with our application stack out of the box and get them thinking about rfid beyond traditional supply chain applications
5853675 we want to make it clear we are in the solid state business
5853676 this is just the first iteration of our roadmap we will be developing a range of products for a variety of market segments

5853692 we have increased staff in both engineering and support so we are launching this new facility to accommodate for this expansion and scale for future growth
5853693 many technology companies have moved their development and support functions from australia to china and india
5853694 but for red hat the growth of these two economies has contributed to the expansion of our operations in australia brisbane is the regional headquarters for engineering in asia
5853695 our brisbane centre provides service and support to customers around the globe with australian and new zealand customers benefiting further because support is available in their time zone
5853696 a number of significant announcements were made at the red hat summit in june particularly around open virtualisation and linux automation strategies
5853697 hand in hand with these announcements weve increased the local investment in behind the scenes engineering functions as part of our commitment to these initiatives
5853698 under our approach communities will no longer have to slice and dice every federal dollar to qualify for niche programs that do little to improve their communities or commutes

5853710 they still need to settle on the final wording of the corresponding contracts
5853711 they are working on the final details in order to implement that agreement
5853712 nothing will change and they will get exactly the same style they were getting at westlb
5853713 one of the concerns westlb had was it didnt want its clients to be left unattended so they found us and we came to an agreement to take it from there
5853714 we obviously recognize there is a risk that some clients might prefer to consider other options
5853715 the work we have been doing with westlb is to show the clients we are very committed to giving them the service they want and the management style they have chosen and there wont be any disruptions in this process
5853716 from a group perspective asset management is a business that hasnt yet obtained the dimensions and relevance it should so thats one of the reasons weve decided to invest further in this business
5853717 its more than a partnership it goes to the point of actually being equity partners as well
5853718 theres obviously a close relationship with bradesco which works not only for us in the asset management group but also as a whole more consolidated and more integrated business

5853721 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5853722 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us
5853723 would be very unpleasant for most people to watch its really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset and the rest of the day is spent trying to repress that through whatever creative devices we can find
5853724 they have used fringe scientists and fake experts to muddy scientific debates on global warming stem cell research evolution and other matters

5853728 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
5853729 i cannot say with certainty which of my motives are the strongest but i know which of them deserve to be followed and looking back through my work i see that it is invariably where i lacked a political purpose that i wrote lifeless books and was betrayed into purple passages sentences without meaning decorative adjectives and humbug generally

5853756 our earth is deteriorating and as much as we try to convey the message were still going to be using our cars were still going to be wasting our energy by showing people this exhibit it will educate people about what we can do
5853757 one idea is to have a lot of murals and public art
5853758 we were working with artists who really believed that art could bring the community together we wanted to bring together different cultures through public art we set up an outdoor stage for performers
5853759 there was this one girl who was into bringing a lot of culture i was interested in bringing technology it was interesting bringing all these ideas into one plan
5853760 the black cherry bombshells is a really fun comic thats equal parts dawn of the dead and mad max if thats not enough for you theres a ruthless female elvis impersonator warlord calling all the shots yeah you read that right
5853761 coming on like a cranked up dose of tartakovskys early powerpuff girls but co directed by russ meyer and rikdo koshi the bcbs are fast winning over the hearts and minds of the comics faithful
5853762 black cherry bombshells is dynamic and action packed fans of manga and comics should love the edgy retro style art
5853763 just the right side of grim with a dash of playful thrown in for good measure
5853764 the creators have admittedly and successfully super imposed female characters over traditional male action movie roles
5853765 the black cherry bombshells are definitely the cool shit like land of the dead made babies with thunderdome pretty awesome

5853792 i cannot comprehend in my small brain where they got the 40 000 for the same thing it was last year
5853793 i cant afford to pay 1200 and 1500 in taxes on something that has not went up in value thats what im so mad about
5853794 im hoping to either stay the same or drop it a little where i can financially swim
5853795 mrs bishop do have an idea of what you think it would be
5853796 my recommendation to the board would be to take it back to the 07 value and then do a review
5853797 yeah im satisfied as long as it dont go up
5853798 there are eight beds and thats not very many beds we have 10 or 12 inmates almost all of the time
5853799 all together its a penny increase and half of it would go away when the jail is paid for and we think that would be in about 13 years
5853800 due to changes in methodology based on historical data from the interactive advertising bureau writes marketingcharts
5853801 even as video becomes the great growth area for internet advertising theres a major disconnect between the amount of time people spend with short form video especially user generated and the ad dollars that accompany such video content
5853802 any time you are in the hospital its got to be pretty serious
5853803 the government can say it would like to build bullet trains but congress can decide it is a bad idea and give priority to finishing works on all state capital subways
5853804 if you look at experiences in other parts of the world you will see there was strong government participation in all of them we probably wont do it differently
5853805 according to the economic development secretary nucor and cosipar are still in negotiations and therefore the possible location of the plant and its capacity are unknown

5853861 muir weaves commentary thoughtful analyses and humor into a true art form
5853862 muirs genius lies in his giving context to the films

5853870 a good 18 steps above the usual dubious faux scholar blogger he takes enormous time and effort analysing unmercifully yet attuned to heretofore dismissed value every release he turns his attention to

5853904 i understand that the country cannot continue unprotected from this evil the national territory needs to be protected and thats why we feel that its time not only for the airplanes to be bought but everything thats necessary to confront narcotics traffic more successfully

5853907 san francisco film society announces launch of new filmmaker services programs
5853908 there has been a very steady decline in the funding available to media arts organizations
5853909 its become increasingly clear over the past three to five years that to be able to offer these kind of services that are vitally needed they need to be part of a larger organization with more of a critical mass our capacity diminished but the need for the services has not thats why we think its critical to have these services now under the stewardship of the film society
5853910 a crucial part of the film societys mission one that we care very deeply about is the celebration of bay area film culture in all its varied and vibrant forms we are very happy to expand and strengthen our activities in this area and to shoulder the responsibility of carrying on and renewing film arts foundations extraordinary legacy
5853911 i view the san francisco film commission as the third leg in a three legged stool
5853912 over three decades film arts foundation built a publishing program that engaged filmmakers on their own terms and in their own language
5853913 i am excited and more than a little relieved that the san francisco film society has stepped forward to preserve film arts publishing legacy while setting the foundation for the dynamic suite of publications that are yet to come we look forward to unveiling a new magazine in early 2009 that will continue to speak to filmmakers and film lovers where they live and breathe
5853914 i made it to match because this will be a perfect beer girl costume the blouse is a blouse i already owned the only other company i have bought from that makes their own designs and makes clothing to order is this place called cameo intimates com

5853920 do you realize that only 30 or 25 or 40 insert your favorite number from your favorite poll of eligible americans actually vote thats outrageous and weve got to do something about it
5853921 why is it that in every election we have to choose between the lesser of two evils
5853922 why cant we have civil campaigns that are strictly about issues
5853923 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
5853924 im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years
5853925 everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us once we were working it felt like a good fit
5853926 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
5853927 if that were true wouldnt one expect at least one of the landowners to ask for something in writing
5853928 wouldnt there be one piece of historical evidence supporting that allegation
5853929 i made it to match because this will be a perfect beer girl costume the blouse is a blouse i already owned the only other company i have bought from that makes their own designs and makes clothing to order is this place called cameo intimates com
5853930 its called a raquel cami garter and i purchased it from trashy com trashy lingerie is based out of los angeles and their own seamstresses make these items as you order them they have the best lingerie as far as quality and originality anywhere that cami garter costs about 150 bucks and the matching thong costs about 40 its a little expensive for lingerie but this is not something that will ever fall apart because its so well made hey when you lounge around the house in sexy lingerie all day you need to buy stuff that will take a little wear and tear i wear a bra i bought from them in my video ultimate cherry brady interview its called the cameo sheer comfort bra in the color sunflower its a 36g and its very comfortable both companies should take pride because they are really putting out some quality products
5853931 failed to fix inadequate monitoring requirements and prohibited states and local authorities from doing so
5853932 we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air
5853933 there is still a lot of work to do before this city is fully recovered
5853934 and for people who are still hurting and not yet back in their homes a brighter day might seem impossible yet a brighter day is coming and it is heralded by hopeful signs of progress
5853935 its defined him a great deal in the publics mind
5853936 that along with the war in iraq are really the pivotal events in his political demise
5853937 first impressions have ways of becoming lasting ones and certainly that was the case with katrina
5853938 its not the quantity of the visits its the quality of the visits
5853939 more like a supercharged comptrollers office than a supercharged recovery office
5853940 if its left abandoned certainly that isnt helpful to the redevelopment of either of those heavily damaged neighborhoods that surround it
5853941 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
5853942 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
5853943 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5853944 this convention in denver is one is which people well known and people not as well known will come together across party lines across geographic divides because they believe in change
5853945 his message all along is that the ideas have to come from the people
5853946 my voice shakes when i speak in front of 50 people at work at a meeting
5853947 when i saw that motorcade come down the cul de sac i couldnt speak i couldnt swallow within a couple minutes he put us at so much ease
5853948 im just a poor railroader ive got a small house and a family im trying to raise barack and michelle can relate to that because of their upbringing
5853949 we are pleased the university is pursuing an agreement that would make these records publicly available
5853950 the donors only concerns regarding the collection are due to personnel information that could include names confidential salary information and even social security numbers
5853951 just gone through one of the most secretive administrations in our history
5853952 forty four is out of the question i would say 22 is out of the question as well
5853953 but i think the expectations werent as high going in
5853954 id been patient and patient and kept fighting my way back i was relentless
5853955 we want ohios voters and the rest of the nation to see that we have prepared a transparent process of transporting voting equipment ballots and supplies
5853956 she allowed for the counties to implement their own way of doing this
5853957 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5853958 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5853959 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5853960 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5853961 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5853962 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5853963 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5853964 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5853965 an important next step in the journey to ensuring the nations energy security
5853966 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5853967 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5853968 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5853969 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5853970 students have come to expect 24 7 connectedness and mobility
5853971 now flexibility and ease of function to socialize communicate and be entertained is what theyre demanding
5853972 kom je over twee weken naar amsterdam om eens met ons te praten over je boek

5853975 it was really fun i dont know i feel a second career in wrestling
5853976 chris jericho is the single greatest thing on any wrestling show right now
5853977 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
5853978 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
5853979 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
5853980 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
5853981 long has our nation the united states of america kept the forces of chaos at bay
5853982 by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe
5853983 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey we ve got a fish over here with two mouths
5853984 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i can t speculate on what might have caused it
5853985 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
5853986 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
5853987 for the most part what we have been getting is natural parasites and fin erosion which are normal in sand bed rivers
5853988 throughout the 12 years there has been no significant impact shown from oilsands development
5853989 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesn t do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
5853990 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved
5853991 some of the community concern was that even if they were bringing them in fish for testing i don t think ramp was doing a great job in communicating back to those individuals about the testing
5853992 has a quality of liquid essence taken from the lush watery landscapes that encompass the bodies of water that surrounds my daily life
5853993 so let me get this straight if we change this little doohicky on the screen we drop the price of oil ill bet obama doesnt know about this
5853994 i wanna have the man in that office fired he gave me this stupid hat

5854018 no senator when i point and click i use this thing here we call it a mouse
5854019 so this internet thing can actually be used by presidential candidates to raise money i must then immediately halt our panning operation at sutters mill
5854020 orchestra b row f seats 11 amp 12 these are great seats for johnny mathis
5854021 mccain should be doing commercials for fathead that orange safety helmut almost fits him
5854022 quick go left they are going to eat pac man
5854023 garrett if we drill over here we can really tick obama off
5854024 thats nice but i really came in here to see if you had any orange arm floaties to match my hardhat
5854025 hey garrett can you show me a closeup of the available spot for drilling next to george w i need some of that bush money

5854041 who do i have to sleep with to get a beat 360 t shirt
5854042 now i usually wear a hard hat when i work on the computer but what does that say i forgot my reading goggles
5854043 look there thats gasoline some say its after the refining process but i say its gasoline the moment the drill hits the oil bed
5854044 no too orangy i want my hair to be the same color as kathy griffin
5854045 so youre honestly telling me the arrow this here screen moves whenever you move that gerbil down there
5854046 if you will not fight for right when you can easily win without blood shed if you will not fight when your victory is sure and not too costly you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival
5854047 the secret of happiness is freedom and the secret of freedom is courage
5854048 okay sure but i dont really know what to say i mean i s

5854068 father thomas is a martyr he sacrificed his life for the poor and marginalized
5854069 but he did not die in vain because his body and his blood enrich the church in india particularly the church in andhra pradesh the southeastern state where he died
5854070 the church in india is shocked and deeply saddened by this barbarous killing the result of a growing climate of intolerance and violence against christians in this country
5854071 have for decades been at the service of the least fortunate in india and this makes them targets of forces of evil who do not want the marginalized and impoverished to become empowered
5854072 the magnitude of benefit we found in the current study of three points on the roland disability score is likely to be important for patients

5854120 es la mejor opci n porque el terminal de alta nueva ya est agotado
5854121 un usuario que mostr su inter s por el iphone 3g y que se subscribi a la lista de correo de informaci n del terminal
5854122 porque los terminales de alta nueva est n agotados en casi todo el pa s y el alta nueva no es posible hasta que lleguen nuevos terminales dentro de bastante tiempo es muy posible que usted se dirija a un punto de venta para realizar un alta nueva y solamente queden disponibles altas para migraci n de n meros procedentes de otras operadoras
5854123 por supuesto que puede mandar mms con un iphone tenga usted en cuenta que el iphone es un terminal de ultim sima generaci n
5854124 usted no necesita ning n ordenador ni hoy ni nunca nosotros le mandamos el iphone a su casa en 12 d as laborables completamente activado y funcionando solo necesito sus datos bancarios dni etc
5854125 puede comentarlo con su pareja si no desea hacer el tr mite ahora mismo de hecho le podemos hacer la misma oferta que a usted y le mandamos ambos terminales a la vez
5854126 ahora mismo en stock solamente tenemos terminales con portabilidad los de alta nueva ya se han agotado de todas formas puede usted dirigirse a un punto de venta movistar y entrar en una lista de espera para altas nuevas tenga en cuenta de todos modos que la oferta de portabilidad est sujeta a la disponibilidad del momento de la llamada es decir que puede que ma ana ya ni siquiera tengamos terminales para portabilidades y no podamos ofrecerle la oferta que le comento
5854127 si seg n veo en las especificaciones es posible grabar v deo con la c mara de 2 megap xeles que incluye el terminal con varios formatos pero no se puede hacer videoconferencia
5854128 lo que pone en la web al respecto del uso de los datos en un ordenador se refiere a que la tarifa de datos contratada para iphone solamente puede usarse con un iphone pero dado que el iphone es capaz de transferir datos s que puede usarse como aparato receptor de datos para que los transfiera a otro dispositivo de todas formas le voy a pasar con una compa era que est mucho m s al tanto de esta posibilidad que me comenta no se retire
5854129 la tarifa de datos que se ofrece en exclusiva para iphone es solamente para iphone y es igual que una l nea adsl convencional mientras los datos se transfieran a trav s del iphone los puede pasar a donde quiera
5854130 blockbuster has pulled back on promoting its dvd subscription service quite a bit the last few quarters
5854131 i dont expect blockbuster to sit on the sidelines forever it seems like a pretty good opportunity for netflix to gain a lot of market share
5854132 theyre attracting more people than ever on less marketing spending
5854133 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5854134 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5854135 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5854136 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5854137 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5854138 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5854139 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5854140 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5854141 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5854142 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5854143 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5854144 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5854145 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5854146 blockbuster which recently abandoned its foolish quest to buy circuit city
5854147 its a video store why would they sell a blu ray player
5854148 you know im a busy person im just going to get it
5854149 widevines technology helps cinemanow expand delivery of high quality digital content across any consumer electronics device or platform
5854150 with the integration of widevines multi platform and multi format solution we ensure our content partners receive the highest level of protection which is a key factor in their ongoing support for cinemanows open platform and domain based business model
5854151 we know that our customers are sometimes interested in the lower cost option that used products can offer them
5854152 in addition many are looking for items that are no longer in print of course we want to serve our customers and meet all of their needs so we have this option on borders com
5854153 its one more level of service and convenience that redbox offers its customers
5854154 pre viewed dvd sales are a natural extension for the brand
5854155 borders marketplace is still in its early stages and it is our plan to have the service mature further before marketing it widely
5854156 we anticipate making it more visible in the future our first priority has been to launch the site in total and market it
5854157 thus no consent was sought nor was any consent obtained from persons who utilize the facebook beacon activated affiliates web site who were not facebook members
5854158 even with respect to facebook users the beacon program did not obtain any consent prior to the communication of identifying transactional information to facebook
5854159 i think facebook is still trying to make beacon work and the roots of what they are doing make sense
5854160 but if people keep thinking that their privacy is being violated facebook has to listen to its users because without users there will be no facebook
5854161 its a digital breath of fresh air and facebook needs to be held accountable
5854162 the lawsuit and public outrage over beacon forced facebook to backpedal on its plans but the fact of the matter is that facebook is a black data collection box
5854163 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate
5854164 being the first airport to offer redbox is a natural fit for nashville international airport because our vision is to deliver the nashville airports experience by providing exemplary customer service and premier airport services and facilities
5854165 if you want blu ray go get blu ray this product is meant to improve playback of dvds
5854166 were introducing a whole new group of artists to new audiences that is resulting in their itunes downloads being exponentially higher than they would otherwise be as well as new album sales and new merchandising opportunities
5854167 it makes it more clear to shareholders that yahoos board is amenable to new ideas and is willing to do whats necessary to get the business back on track
5854168 i am still very angry at this board and i am sure other shareholders feel the same way
5854169 yang is a reasonably smart person but it wasnt until microsoft entered the picture that he really started to make some changes
5854170 i dont think this is the right team to lead yahoo i dont have a lot of faith in it
5854171 eventually though it might take time your beliefs concerning the company can influence other board members
5854172 carl has a particular genius in making judgments on the value of companies
5854173 what hes less good at is understanding what to do to close the value gap
5854174 at blockbuster while i liked the ceo expenses were sky high and the results werent good
5854175 we all agreed to bring in a new ceo who has done an excellent job especially at cutting excess costs
5854176 the only thing that sucks is we cant rent older movies
5854177 if you go back into the video cassette era there were some attempts to do rental kiosks it never really took off in the u s
5854178 dvd changed all that because of the size of them the
5854179 its very clear that we have a more significant value proposition in times of economic challenge
5854180 although we do well when things are good we also do well when things are bad
5854181 our alliance with facebook included numerous levels of privacy protection built in for our online subscribers
5854182 to this day however facebook still receives personal identifiable information from participating web sites whether the facebook member has chosen to distribute their information or not
5854183 you always remember the trips to blockbuster and then were blown away with the switch to dvd the sound and picture were amazing
5854184 why go buy a movie when you can just dial it up and watch it instantly
5854185 how is that possible north american women go out of their way to hide their age except me on my blog so where did you find it
5854186 you mentioned that you were born shortly before your father got his x degree so i looked that up
5854187 yes and it was very difficult to find the right one your last name is not uncommon
5854188 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5854189 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5854190 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5854191 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5854192 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5854193 our focus during the first half of the year has been upon laying the ground work for the ution of the drilling programs in the uk north sea and offshore romania
5854194 made best efforts to complete the transaction within the previously disclosed timelines defined in the binding letter agreement
5854195 determined that the transaction is likely to be of net benefit to canada for purposes of the investment canada act
5854196 for 10 years we became accustomed to the canadian dollar at 75 to 80 cents which fundamentally meant for an american coming up here you come up for two days and the third day is free
5854197 you put all of those together and the numbers from the u s are down there s no doubt about that at all
5854198 when consumer confidence is shaken discretionary expenditures like travel are affected
5854199 that same day visitor from the united states has just been disappearing there has been some effort to shift marketing in the u s to a longer haul visitor
5854200 i encourage hoteliers all the time to look at your market and then make sure that you devote your resources very very carefully to that
5854201 a lot of the international visitors that have come to canada those travel decisions were made six eight ten months ago
5854202 although we may see gas prices impacting some short term decision making we really haven t started to feel the effects of it
5854203 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey we ve got a fish over here with two mouths
5854204 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i can t speculate on what might have caused it
5854205 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
5854206 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
5854207 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesn t do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
5854208 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved
5854209 it s a good project that will allow us to continue to operate for many more years a plant that is safe a plant that will produce electricity at a competitive price
5854210 it s a good business decision for the regional economy as well as for the rest of quebec
5854211 our estimate derives from eight years of feasibility studies evaluation preparatory work and inspections
5854212 generally in the nuclear world a lot of it doesn t have to do with economics and more to with the prestige of having a nuclear facility
5854213 frankly 2 billion for 600 megawatts is quite a lot
5854214 the government has had a policy that won t accept a used fuel waste site in quebec
5854215 today however they have given the ok to producing more radioactive waste that s hypocritical
5854216 it usually takes 40 years for the radiation to subside enough to get near it
5854217 they re going to stop the reactor and send the workers in right after they say there is no danger but that s completely false
5854218 it was a joy to read a book about secondlife where i kept nodding my head instead of gnashing my teeth the chapters describing sl activities and social conventions rang true to me and focused on the things i love about sl its culture of community sharing and friendship the author obviously knows sl well and loves being here
5854219 when you have a long term uptrend excesses build up along the way we are witnessing a correction
5854220 demand for commodities will remain at a high level in countries like china and india if we see a serious worldwide recession then we will see the end of the commodities boom
5854221 what we like are the consumer plays as much as possible we are trying to get exposure to consumer oriented sectors whether that is consumer banking or retail
5854222 audience members liked our style and asked us where we got our clothing
5854223 emily exudes the attitude and creative spirit manic panic has built its reputation on and because she resonates with todays young rockers shes a natural choice for us
5854224 the next shock is going to be bigger and bigger still
5854225 the shocks keep getting bigger because we keep propping things up and bailing everyone out
5854226 guys were making too many mistakes here in the u k
5854227 oh my god were going to go down and if we go down the whole system goes down
5854228 okay got to print some more money got to save the day
5854229 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5854230 i wish to thank the residents and the local community for their patience and assistance during this operation and for their direct support for passengers from the bus
5854231 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun

5854242 really do you want the world to end because that is what will happen
5854243 browser share has nearly doubled to 0 31 since the 3g launch
5854244 of course there was a great symbolism to them doing this at the senaki base
5854245 in their eyes senaki was a bit of nato that they just dont want to see in georgia
5854246 the buildings the arms all gone if you consider that this is one of the few such modern bases we have this was very important for us

5854252 lower the risk for having further heart attacks and related disease
5854253 although we lowered homocysteine by almost one third it did not seem to have any beneficial effects
5854254 our findings might imply that homocysteine does not change the course of coronary artery disease but its just a risk marker of increased risk in coronary artery disease patients
5854255 how lost his her groove but eventually got it back
5854256 its not that the wind is blowin its what the wind is blowin
5854257 but he is a perfectly normal affectionate curious cat and is a joy to have around

5854263 i think you have a different perspective when youve lived some history
5854264 vision of where we stand as a nation and where we stand among nations
5854265 we just have to find the cooler sites like yakima and higher elevations
5854266 and were going to grow as fast as our sources can provide us with good fruit
5854267 the concept of creating a balanced society in world of zellians is truly engaging and challenging and we are designing this experience to be fun and accessible for all audiences from casual to core gamers

5854271 some of the things just werent getting out we heard dispatch say so and so you have a pending structure fire but then those people wouldnt answer
5854272 a structure fire has to be handled right now versus lets say a tree hanging over a power line that can wait for a little bit
5854273 during that time were going to be looking for blocked exits over crowding and making sure the building itself is safe
5854274 theres not a limit on the number of credential people that can be there at any one moment one time one hour or one day
5854275 he made out a ticket for it and said well call you when its ready

5854278 oh i dont have to answer your questions any more
5854279 hes refusing to sign the conditions the judge imposed on him yesterday
5854280 his attorney made it clear he was going to agree to the new terms
5854281 the court basically said the defendant has the option at any time to sign the conditions of release
5854282 if he does so the jail will release him if not and he chooses to remain in custody the court date will remain as previously set
5854283 he is 12 years old and a wonderful cat but i would like to travel now so you should find him a nice home
5854284 yes they are 10 and 11 years old but i am pregnant now so i should not have a cat anymore
5854285 i will let him out on the side of the road before i give you money to take him you are just going to make money on his adoption so why should i give you anything
5854286 we remain convinced that auction market preferreds of closed end funds are a conservatives conservative security with respect to credit risk
5854287 drive c must be a hard drive for softwrap to correctly register
5854288 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
5854289 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii
5854290 paying homage to the pulp horror comics and films that inspired generations of gore fans the house of the dead overkill will expose gamers to a brand new fleshy rollercoaster ride of revolting dismemberment
5854291 this is the hardcore wii title youve been waiting for
5854292 figure out why the ad was rejected before the video ends
5854293 call of duty 3 was done in a year treyarch developed it for playstation 3 3 wii xbox 360 ps2 xbox all in one year and came out with an 8 0s range title thats a pretty big achievement and i dont know a lot of teams that could put together a game on five platforms in a year and score an average in the 8 0s
5854294 your grandmother or grandfather or whoever was canning might have gotten away with a lot of things but that doesnt mean youre going to
5854295 you are playing around with something you dont want to play around with
5854296 a versatile mollusc lends itself to a variety of styles
5854297 there was no ecological damage we didnt have a fish kill
5854298 it reflects a larger pattern which is his companys record of polluting oregons waterways and his votes in washington to roll back environmental regulation
5854299 our main focus and priority right now is to make sure this is repaired thoroughly
5854300 what the hell was that did you have one of those airblades in your restroom too
5854301 it sounded like a 747 was taking off in there
5854302 christ i know it keeps paper out of a landfill but how much electricity does it take to power that jet engine
5854303 hell i can buy blue jeans for 25 at tj maxx that produce the same result and for about 80 decibels less
5854304 you can sell people anything if it plugs in and makes a whirring noise
5854305 just call it earth friendly and people will fall for it

5854309 its not a psychological problem its a major physiological force coming from within your brain and body to eat at night so inappropriately
5854310 these people do not have proper judgment they can get up they see their environment they know where the kitchen is but they have no judgment no inhibition thats the problem

5854321 i dont know what our government does period i martin luther king
5854322 low informati mccain ahead of obama nationally as america wants government out of the way
5854323 i just realized from my own knowledge that some o the obama campaign is issuing another of its paten
5854324 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co game set and match
5854325 we though this would be difficult but when we popped a question to sajid or kasmi about who drove the car bomb into the civil hospital in ahmedabad on july 26 the answer came promptly that it was zahid shaikh who too has been arrested
5854326 perhaps their confidence stems from the fact that we do not have any material evidence against them also the fact that police have never been able to prove any case against simi must be reassuring
5854327 ask them anything about their involvement in past blasts and they will talk on future plans they give the impression that ahmedabad was their final victory it is here that they are hiding something

5854337 the creative life is difficult to build because at almost every turn we are challenged by the patriarchy
5854338 we have in our society places for business people for numbers people for healers for teachers administrators tradespeople but the creative person must frequently invent a place for herself in my experience this has meant doing my own creative work at a financial loss and finding other ways to make money for others around me i see that they turn to teaching or working with children as this is a place where our society feels good about funding creation

5854452 upstream is used to describe assets that are early in the production process such as mines while
5854453 rates went too far and the reserve is now trying to reverse them
5854454 they are now becoming more concerned that we might have a recession
5854455 less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5854456 we think there could be three cuts in a row
5854457 household net worth had declined by almost 5 per cent over the first half of 2008
5854458 in effect reserve bank board members believed that monetary policy had become so tight there was the risk of serious damage to the economy
5854459 more than 20 dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market
5854460 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5854461 the price must be maintained at a level close to us100 because the costs have increased
5854462 the market is reacting to reports that opec may cut production
5854463 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5854464 oil has lost its bullish mojo and it may take a major event or a great technical stand to go get its groove back

5854476 the water babies a fairy tale for a land baby
5854477 once upon a time there was a little chimney sweep and his name was tom that is a short name and you have heard it before so you will not have much trouble in remembering it he lived in a great town in the north country where there were plenty of chimneys to sweep and plenty of money for tom to earn and his master to spend he could not read nor write and did not care to do either and he never washed himself for there was no water up the court where he lived he had never been taught to say his prayers he never had heard of god or of christ except in words which you never have heard and which it would have been well if he had never heard he cried half his time and laughed the other half he cried when he had to climb the dark flues rubbing his poor knees and elbows raw and when the soot got into his eyes which it did every day in the week and when his master beat him which he did every day in the week and when he had not enough to eat which happened every day in the week likewise and he laughed the other half of the day when he was tossing halfpennies with the other boys or playing leap frog over the posts or bowling stones at the horses legs as they trotted by which last was excellent fun when there was a wall at hand behind which to hide as for chimney sweeping and being hungry and being beaten he took all that for the way of the world like the rain and snow and thunder and stood manfully with his back to it till it was over as his old donkey did to a hailstorm and then shook his ears and was as jolly as ever and thought of the fine times coming when he would be a man and a master sweep and sit in the public house with a quart of beer and a long pipe and play cards for silver money and wear velveteens and ankle jacks and keep a white bull dog with one gray ear and carry her puppies in his pocket just like a man and he would have apprentices one two three if he could how he would bully them and knock them about just as his master did to him and make them carry home the soot sacks while he rode before them on his donkey with a pipe in his mouth and a flower in his button hole like a king at the head of his army yes there were good times coming and when his master let him have a pull at the leavings of his beer tom was the jolliest boy in the whole town
5854478 for 10 years we became accustomed to the canadian dollar at 75 to 80 cents which fundamentally meant for an american coming up here you come up for two days and the third day is free
5854479 you put all of those together and the numbers from the u s are down theres no doubt about that at all
5854480 when consumer confidence is shaken discretionary expenditures like travel are affected
5854481 that same day visitor from the united states has just been disappearing there has been some effort to shift marketing in the u s to a longer haul visitor
5854482 i encourage hoteliers all the time to look at your market and then make sure that you devote your resources very very carefully to that
5854483 a lot of the international visitors that have come to canada those travel decisions were made six eight ten months ago
5854484 although we may see gas prices impacting some short term decision making we really havent started to feel the effects of it
5854485 we should not reject any idea just because it is radical or controversial
5854486 we may be able to find an acceptable way to allow a meaningful compensation for some living unrelated kidney donors without breaching ethical principles or hurting the sensitivities of others
5854487 it is not a good idea to legalize payment for organ donors as such payment institutionalizes the belief that the wealthy ill have property rights to the body parts of the poor
5854488 if monetary incentive makes a potential living donor more willing to save another life what is wrong in allowing that
5854489 rich people have no reason to sell a kidney that is the flaw that is unacceptable in any scheme involving purchasing a kidney its exploitative
5854490 thats not indicative of every house in marin losing that equity
5854491 the only reason bay area sales were higher for the first time in three and a half years were first time buyers and investors reacting to deep discounts as a result of foreclosures in marin thats not so much the case but certainly what little foreclosures you have had had an impact on prices
5854492 a lot of people are out looking for a bargain right now
5854493 are looking at foreclosure properties and those are the ones we need to get past for the whole general
5854494 were in a knee jerk reaction from where we were before
5854495 the pendulum has gone back 180 degrees its extremely difficult to get money right now
5854496 no bay area county is down that little from a year ago
5854497 that could just be a sign of the considerable average means of the buyers in marin
5854498 its not like it was and thats a good thing
5854499 they truly need to be in touch with the comparable sales in their neighborhood
5854500 there are variations not only in community to community but in neighborhood to neighborhood
5854501 many of them are holding off because of that anxiety level
5854502 korea is a good team because they won all their previous games and they pitched well today
5854503 but we tried different pitchers because the final stage is more important than today

5854505 i was shown the hard way the problem with my habits
5854506 problems come from not living the life youre supposed to
5854507 corporations have cracked down and theyre not hiring anybody with felony convictions
5854508 we need to hold job fairs talk with employers and educate the community
5854509 most people think you come out of prison a rough person
5854510 what i see is a lot of fragility in people theyre scared off balance and the only habits they have had in the past are bad ones

5854516 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5854517 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal

5854520 the unhappy sight of hard working people many of them migrants to new zealand who had lost their money to a scheme that is still being investigated
5854521 in the last two weeks much has been made of the drop in gold prices to around us800 an ounce but this compares with a gold price of around us650 an ounce at the same time last year
5854522 in lihirs case also they have got a very positive outlook over the next three years basically production for gold could double
5854523 i am starting to become concerned again we are not coming out the housing slump
5854524 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
5854525 innovation is the path to massive quantities of cleaner cheaper energy the people were funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of egs and bringing us closer to our goal of renewable energy cheaper than coal
5854526 egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector
5854527 if the west swallows the pill and forgives russia the georgian war the invasion of peacekeeping tanks into ukraine will just be a matter of time
5854528 how do you prevent the russian ships from coming in
5854529 i dont know of any way to do so if we continue to stick to the point of view of not letting them in this will mean a war between ukraine and russia
5854530 there can be no business as usual under present circumstances
5854531 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honour the words of president dmitry medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5854532 considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5854533 full respect for the principles of georgias independence sovereignty and territorial integrity
5854534 after careful consideration our board rejected the offer after concluding that their proposal was not in the best interest of our stockholders the board believes the 5 25 offering price does not reflect the value of heelys and that entering into discussions with skechers based on their unsolicited proposal is premature at this time
5854535 operating margins have substantially weakened in recent years to about 19 from the mid 20 area as a result of commodity cost pressures and the highly competitive operating environment
5854536 these cost increases are expected to increase to up to 900 million in fiscal 2008 in addition to about 350 million in fiscal 2007

5854539 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
5854540 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
5854541 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
5854542 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments
5854543 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
5854544 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
5854545 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
5854546 many women in our previous studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent treatment options
5854547 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find treatment for it
5854548 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
5854549 the more we understand the better we can treat it and the better for everyone
5854550 there is so much lost productivity in women with pmdd just think how much more a woman could accomplish if she didnt have to lose so much of herself and her energy every month
5854551 sorry i cant help you with that chargeback as a domain isnt actually a tangible thing in facts its an intangible item
5854552 listen i like it when you pay me regular commissions when your deals go ok but theres no way im getting embroiled in the pain read time cash of helping you sort out a crook who has stolen off you
5854553 i think in a lot of respects we are looking at this season as fresh start
5854554 we have had a very successful group of players graduate over the past two seasons and we have brought in 17 newcomers in that time to take their place
5854555 i think in a lot of respects we are looking at this season as fresh start
5854556 we have had a very successful group of players graduate over the past two seasons and we have brought in 17 newcomers in that time to take their place
5854557 there is definitely an element of redemption from the 2007 season
5854558 last year we didnt come in fit and it felt like we were running uphill from the very beginning we finished the year so poorly losing two road games and then the conference tournament i think people are really excited to get after it this year those feelings have certainly been reinforced since the start of preseason our players came in a week early on their own trained on their own and have been working really hard there is surely an optimism about the team we have had a target on our back for the last few years but it feels different to adopt a new underdog mentality it can energize you if you channel it the right way
5854559 i think this is one of the most talented groups of attacking players we have ever had
5854560 we will have the ability to build an attack through combinations and break down defenses with the drive and dish we also have three or four players who can slice and dice through a crowd i think it will be a lot of fun to put together a mix of those elements that will work
5854561 the offense will run through isleib who can do anything that needs to be done on a soccer field from an attacking standpoint
5854562 additionally we will have some really nice pieces around those three players we will miss a lot redshirting with a knee injury i dont think we can replace everything she does with one player she can head the ball pass it hold it and defend that being said i am really impressed with our new players up front can hold the ball find other players and slice and dice through a defense has been clinical in her finishing with both feet and i think she will be able to score goals jen cristoffers has been hampered with a knee injury but when healthy she has pace bite and a history of scoring goals hopfully we can put it all together and do some damage around our opponents goal
5854563 this is a group that can hold the ball well connect passes and get forward as a unit
5854564 centrally sanchez is a fifth year senior who will return to the midfield to provide a lot of stability and experience she played there in her first two years then last year we put her in the back
5854565 we will also have some very good wide players including reineke is another freshman who can really run at people with the ball and we will use mallory mitamura is another freshman who has shown good instincts defensively and will probably play in the wide midfield but whether we put her in the midfield or in the back she has good instincts on where to be how to disrupt play and position herself well we will have a lot of options and i think we will be able to hang onto the ball really well
5854566 our defense is definitely an area we have to improve on from last year
5854567 more than just tactics or decisions we have to be better mentally we gave up a lot of soft goals either at the wrong time in a game or as a result of a silly play it seemed that whatever we did wrong we got punished for this team has to change its mentality and we have a good group to do that is back from acl surgery after suffering the injury in mid season and we really missed her during conference play on the right side or in the middle morgan is as hard nosed as they come and she will provide some of that bite we missed last year improved tremendously after her freshman year she gives us pace in the back she is a good tackler and is becoming a more well rounded player is back from shoulder surgery and she is another smart player who can handle the ball has gotten stronger and become a better athlete herself both of them could give us some valuable minutes back there lauren porter are both good on the ball good decision makers and are both great in the air is a player we could use in the midfield or in the back wherever we use her she brings a good work ethic and a lot of energy as a freshman and i think she will make an impact
5854568 we dont have a lot of experience coming back in terms of game minutes
5854569 but we do have a lot of good character strong leadership ability and talented goalies
5854570 is a freshman who was named the southern california high school defensive player of the year last year she has great athleticism good feet and is comfortable coming out of her box she has a bright future and will do well for us is another freshman who is a terrific athlete and in the preseason has shown flashes of it she is is getting to the ball making saves and has a lot of tools that we will continue working with
5854571 we always load up the early part of our schedule with tough games
5854572 it helps us get ready for conference play and allows us to test ourselves against quality opponents
5854573 we are always excited to play against schools with good soccer traditions or that come from a conference with strong soccer traditions
5854574 by the time conference competition rolls around our young group will be much more seasoned and ready to take on the mountain west
5854575 over the last few years we really knew who we were as a team going into the season
5854576 it felt like we were just honing ourselves and waiting for the postseason
5854577 our first goal is to play winning soccer we played really attractive soccer a year ago but our mentality wasnt right we gave up goals or failed to put teams away when we had chances and that needs to change we need to play better winning soccer locking down teams on defense making good decisions and making plays when we need to having watched the kids for a few weeks now i have confidence that we can be as good as any team we have had here i think it is overall the most skillful group we have had and i expect that to translate into good soccer and wins there is no question that we are capable of winning the conference championship but we have to go out and prove it
5854578 you hear little whispers and given the form rio has been in and what manchester united have achieved i did think he would get it
5854579 it was a bit nerve wracking and i was actually standing next to rio when fabio told us all after training
5854580 the first thing he did was turn to me and shake my hand that is a measure of the kind of guy he is
5854581 he is an unbelievable player and provides the sort of an example we can all learn from that
5854582 it that showed what kind of character i am to the manager
5854583 to bounce back like i did after that huge disappointment maybe showed the manager what kind of character i am maybe that persuaded him
5854584 ill sit here and say we have to qualify for the world cup and nothing more simple as that
5854585 ive personally learned a few things from the last campaign and ill not be talking about winning the world cup or anything like that
5854586 ive learned from talking about i want to win the euros and things like that
5854587 lets forget all that stuff lets concentrate on qualifying for the world cup in two years time it is in the hands of the players to do that
5854588 weve got the manager and the players to move forward but lets not focus on winning anything we just need to qualify for this world cup and have to concentrate on that
5854589 in the short of space of time weve had with the manager he has stressed about having less anxiety and more confidence and weve done that
5854590 he wants us to express that even more the manager wants us to play like we do for our clubs week in and week out and that is what he is trying to get across
5854591 the future is looking very good for our team with the kind of squad weve got we need the players to do the job on the pitch to get the fans into their seats
5854592 today i am four i am really h u g e now
5854593 i am talking of odds against chance of hundreds of thousands to one
5854594 and just for the record i know a thing or two about statistics i have a phd from glasgow university on statistical ecology and a further 33 years working on statistical data analysis
5854595 did you know that the distribution of olympic swimming medallists against the tropical astrological zodiac signs can be almost exactly mapped by a polynomial function of the third degree
5854596 and i might put it into the second part im still looking for a different sort of rhythm here but im not sure
5854597 he came to hear us in porto the funny thing was he vanished afterwards without even saying hello then we heard nothing for months but eventually we had a meeting where he told us what he had in mind and we agreed to give it a try
5854598 thats why i wanted to work with them i dont ask them to create characters and one of the things in theatre i want to avoid is the identification of actors and a role it allows a really productive imaginative space to open up between them and us for me its much more fruitful than an actor who wants to persuade you he is hamlet and this also fits in with the texts i have chosen which are all to do with doubts and questioning about identity
5854599 thats a wonderful idea maybe i should do it with understudies and get them to mime to playback
5854600 i want it to have a complex effect but not by writing complex things with lots of counterpoint for me the counterpoint is between the music and the other elements so when im composing i have to think about the total effect not just the music
5854601 theres a tendency in theatre and also theatre education to rely on technical know how a sense of we know how to do this but i dont know how to do it i think theatre needs to regain its status as an artwork instead of being a way of presenting fixed narratives with a definable message it should be able to give you something completely marvellous and completely inexplicable
5854602 thank you for calling the office of the taoiseach prime minister however if you wish to call bertie aherns constituency office please ring
5854603 flames were coming up the outside to the top of the bus
5854604 weve got to continue replacing these buses we tend to say we are going to do things and then find ways not to do them
5854605 the bus that burned monday last had its turbo replaced in december 2003 the bus was last inspected by mechanics july 24
5854606 the first year under the new replacement cycle went according to plan and the state brought 527 new buses into the fleet allowing the retirement of buses that had been on the road since the mid 1980s
5854607 leaving the replacement cycle 103 buses short for the two year span
5854608 but in the ensuing budget crisis that was cut to 10 6 million that will buy only 130 new buses
5854609 i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5854610 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5854611 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
5854612 in the second lebanon war we had much greater means and capabilities which we avoided using since during that war we fought against a terror organization and not a country
5854613 in this context if lebanon turns into a hizbullah state we wont restrain our response
5854614 the right of lebanon its people its army and the resistance hizbullah to liberate its land
5854615 a more vital role than it ever has in the past
5854616 there will no longer be a situation in which the war is waged in distant battlefields while in big cities life continues as normal the war will also reach cities and the homes of israeli citizens and the aim of our enemies will be to hit the home front
5854617 more than ever before you in the home front command will have a critical role in the battlefield of the future because you are charged with caring for the civilian population
5854618 one of the things that is important to me is to reduce the amount of anxiety the public feels
5854619 we do not have to scare ourselves more than necessary with respect to the threats
5854620 our analysis clearly shows incredible growth in online pc gaming proof that this industry is far stronger than anyone has reported
5854621 by pioneering new business models the pc has quietly remained the single leading platform for games not only in terms of consumer usage but revenue generation
5854622 the most fascinating thing about pc gaming is its ability to attract such a diverse audience both demographically and geographically
5854623 kobe might want to think about moving here to live
5854624 ive lost earrings chains and all kinds of stuff this time i tuck em in when i go into crowds
5854625 last year when i came here i lost an earring a kid found it on the floor and held on to it for three hours and came back and gave it back to me thats crazy
5854626 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5854627 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5854628 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5854629 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5854630 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5854631 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5854632 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5854633 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5854634 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5854635 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5854636 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5854637 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5854638 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5854639 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5854640 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5854641 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5854642 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5854643 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5854644 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5854645 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5854646 youve got to have the right products and those products have to be priced competitively
5854647 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5854648 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5854649 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5854650 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5854651 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5854652 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5854653 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5854654 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5854655 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5854656 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5854657 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5854658 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5854659 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5854660 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5854661 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5854662 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5854663 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5854664 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5854665 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5854666 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5854667 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5854668 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5854669 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5854670 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5854671 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5854672 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5854673 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5854674 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5854675 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5854676 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5854677 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5854678 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5854679 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5854680 this is a planning took where all things are going
5854681 he had no symptoms of post concussion syndrome when he woke up tuesday morning
5854682 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5854683 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5854684 this just completes our prime time lineup our lineup makes sense now
5854685 a lack of local support could see the closure of a police group representing members of the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt community
5854686 the white house isnt the place to learn how to deal with international crisis the balance of power war and peace and the economic future of the next generation a president has got to know the territory but thats not enough
5854687 sorry but we look forward to working with you in many other ways in the coming years
5854688 intrades record of being wrong is identical to that of the punditocracy extremely good
5854689 even though an obama clinton ticket is one of the few combinations that looks like a knock out punch to mccain and the republicans
5854690 what happens if theres nothing on that page when you turn it
5854691 it was pretty but i didnt want to see her underwear
5854692 i had work to do i didnt want to screw around
5854693 all of these people worked their butts off for paul morrison
5854694 its difficult for other people to separate the two positions
5854695 he was just looking out to see what was going on when they opened fire and he was hit three times there was no reason for this he wasnt doing anything
5854696 they looted the main shop and then started shooting people
5854697 he had gone to see if he could find any food it was a risky thing to do maybe he shouldnt have gone out but he had to feed his family they killed him because he was a georgian and a young man
5854698 they came in two cars usually a military jeep at the front and a minibus at the back its usually young guys in their early 20s they behave like theyre on a hunting trip
5854699 she doesnt have friends or relatives here but well find somewhere for her to stay
5854700 i am an old man this is all i had all the pictures of my family everything had gone now i have nowhere to live who will look after me
5854701 the russians invaded so they have to take responsibility for what happened on occupied territory this is another srebrenica
5854702 i would not rule out that i said that if they provide such a contraption they should have at least helped out
5854703 china is clearly fundamental to our global strategic vision and we are committed to expanding our activities in what is one of the worlds most important markets
5854704 last year we outlined our new ambition to achieve revenues in china totaling usd 2 billion by 2012 and this investment will contribute in reaching this goal
5854705 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents
5854706 sorry you have already printed this coupon the number of times allowed
5854707 it shows that the line leading to humans is not as special as many thought
5854708 after finding this kind of intelligence in apes many people thought it had developed once in one evolutionary line with humans at the end the bird studies show it has developed at least twice
5854709 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5854710 their new found cockiness has got some substance to it
5854711 padla bom namerno ho em no em moram zdravje je na prvem mestu
5854712 od veselja sem sko il v zrak e dan pred festivalom je kazalo da jih bo drugi in tretji dan po 250 kar bi tudi bil soliden uspeh

5854726 on 16 august 1993 ian murdock announced a new linux distribution named debian 15 years later the project started by him is the biggest linux distribution worldwide offering more than 20 000 software packages maintained by over 1000 volunteers supporting more hardware architectures than any other linux distribution and providing a base for more than twenty active derivatives like knoppix skolelinux or ubuntu
5854727 a decision was made for the war to start in august the war would have happened regardless of what the georgians did whether they responded to the provocations or not there would have been an invasion of georgia the goal was to destroy georgias central government defeat the georgian army and prevent georgia from joining nato
5854728 he has been calling angela merkel nicolas sarkozy and rice for months and they have all been telling him to stop worrying that the russians wont do anything and theyve basically been ignoring him
5854729 this was a heavy armoured russian column moving slowly on very rugged terrain in the highest mountain range in europe
5854730 think how many hours of preparation assembly then marching it would take for that column moving at that speed on rugged terrain to be at the kurta bridge at six in the morning if that isnt a premeditated invasion i dont know what is
5854731 tskhinvali doesnt exist its like stalingrad was after the war
5854732 any civilised country would act the same way i may remind you that on september 11 the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
5854733 the holy grail of enzyme catalysis and the ultimate manifestation of understanding of this process is the ability to design enzymes
5854734 what really fits is the electrostatic interaction between the enzyme active site to the substrate charges at the so called transition state where the bonds are halfway to being broken
5854735 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
5854736 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
5854737 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it
5854738 take a bow was bought through her money the video was created with her money and so is her most recent video and single disturbia the label didnt even want to pay a dime for anything close to 750 000 was spent on those two songs alone and now she expects to see money in her account
5854739 an important next step in the journey to ensuring the nations energy security
5854740 we have to conduct a serious investigation in this regard
5854741 what we would like to do is just to make all these places in georgia very transparent open for the free world for the media and international human rights activities
5854742 weve heard that villages have been burned to the ground weve heard of reports of other scenes about some killings and some georgians who are hostages
5854743 we have forgotten or never focused on the ethic cleansing that took place in abkahzia and south ossetia in the early 1990s where a majority of the georgian population was simply driven out
5854744 any discussion of ethnic cleansing has to go back in time
5854745 the big issue that hasnt been mentioned here is osce
5854746 the idea of someone forcing his way with arms into your house killing members of the family and holding them hostage and then have the local police invite that same person to be the peacekeeper in the house to protect the house against further trouble is cynical beyond the normal range of imagination
5854747 yet that is exactly what osce did in assigning to russia the role of peacekeeper after the first war in georgia
5854748 it got very sophisticated because obviously the battery doesnt last long and then we had to look at circuits and interrupters so we have been working on it around two months with a crack team

5854750 very firmly condemns the terrorist acts that have left many victims in algeria
5854751 once again the algerian people are victims of indiscriminate and barbaric terrorist attacks
5854752 the presidency reaffirms its support to algerian authorities in its fight against terrorism and stands alongside algeria in these tragic circumstances
5854753 full solidarity and full support in its fight against terrorism
5854754 the speed at which they move is something i am not able to clarify exactly
5854755 i hope very much that within the day the troops will begin seriously to withdraw
5854756 the attack perpetrated against the french soldiers deployed in afghanistan constitutes a disgraceful and barbaric act
5854757 these soldiers were serving the cause of liberty and democracy
5854758 it is for these values that they gave up their lives
5854759 i bow before their sacrifice their courage does france and the whole of europe proud
5854760 determination to serve the cause which they so nobly defended in afghanistan
5854761 courage of these men who accomplished their duty until the supreme sacrifice
5854762 we are against the agreement between unmik and eulex because it violates un security council resolution 1244 and international law
5854763 the serbian government does not accept the reconfiguration of unmik nor the agreement with eulex
5854764 all deals that arent passed by the security council are unacceptable for serbia
5854765 the recent fall in the price of oil and the fall of the euro against the dollar must have dampened economic concerns about the economy
5854766 market experts have not been particularly taken aback by the negative growth rate of the second quarter they expect weaker but all in all solid economic conditions and do not fear a recession
5854767 we hope that our installations will bring about a net cooling of the area
5854768 if the meltdown is not stopped we hope that it will at least be slowed down
5854769 if you are trying to cool a glacier wind screens are a crazy idea
5854770 these are the main factors and that is why the covers are so effective
5854771 its depressing man it makes you realize how short life is and how unfair it can be i think whats cool is that even with what he had he chose to make the best of it and touch a lot of lives that he wouldnt have if this hadnt happened to him he got the bad end of the deal but he touched a lot of people for sure he touched the 25 people in here

5854790 major compliment that fans still ask me all the time if the shows coming back emotionally i dont want to think about veronica mars every day because it really does make me sad
5854791 i rolled up behind them and i said you just made the biggest mistake you ever made
5854792 to come back and to battle back a couple of times and to have just the wonderful preparation the wonderful team we have to all come together like that it was just spectacular

5854794 to star wars fans chee is the keeper of the holocron arguably the leading expert on everything that happened a long time ago in a galaxy far far away his official title is continuity database administrator for the lucas licensing arm of lucasfilm which means chee keeps meticulous track of not just the six live action movies but also cartoons tv specials scores of videogames and reference books and hundreds of novels and comics
5854795 i wanted to stay clear of certain things that dave was doing in the series so i couldnt put in padme like i wanted to but otherwise lucasfilm gave me a lot of freedom with it

5854799 just before the 2000 olympic trials she broke three bones in her foot and it healed before they knew that so she actually had to wear a special boot so she could walk climb up the ladder and then she would have to kick it off
5854800 she did great in olympic trials in fact she came first in olympic trials in indianapolis in june before they could make the team in fact she even had one dive that was a 10 plus because of extra points and the degree of difficulty
5854801 the results reveal that although learning the language of science remains a primary hurdle students taught using our content first approach demonstrated an improved conceptual and linguistic understanding of science
5854802 furthermore as we examined each groups differential performance the students were randomly divided into two groups it became clear that students ability to communicate using scientific language was significantly impacted by this treatment
5854803 we knew what an apple was before we said apple
5854804 we were hungry and saw an apple and we were able to say give me that apple need drove language acquisition
5854805 teaching science as a language a content first approach to science teaching
5854806 in contrast to foreign language instruction where students are learning new ways to express familiar ideas science instruction often involves the presentation of new ideas expressed through new language
5854807 in science class students get new words and new ideas simultaneously
5854808 wendy needs the healing powers of a full grown mandrake plant if you can help me grow we can save my friend wendy
5854809 the thing that were most excited about is that the students in the treatment group
5854810 got higher scores on every type of question multiple choice and open ended
5854811 they got higher scores when questions were asked in everyday language they got higher scores when questions were asked in science language and when they were asked to write answers to open ended questions they were much better at writing their ideas in science language
5854812 my response to that is that theres no research to document what happens if you teach in this particular way so how do teachers know it works
5854813 and in the classrooms ive seen teachers are not sophisticated in the way they teach good scientific language consistently

5854820 the uncertainty with regard to financials has kept the downward pressure on
5854821 home prices keep falling assets continue to deteriorate the economy continues to slow which can only worsen the unemployment rate and increase delinquencies
5854822 theres seemingly no end to this cycle and thats to the detriment of any financial stock

5854828 the old saying is defense wins championships and offense fills the seats
5854829 you are going to put people in the stands because they want to see you score some points if not soccer would be our sport like the rest of the world
5854830 you can run the football out of the spread and throw out of it says fedora who spent the last three seasons as offensive coordinator at oklahoma state where in each of the past two years the cowboys were in the top 10 in rushing yards and top 20 in total offense per game
5854831 is now you are spreading the entire field and putting the ball into somebodys hands in the open field where if one guy misses you have a chance for an explosive play thats why its the great equalizer
5854832 there is a lot of dimension to it leach says of the spread offense
5854833 you can design your skill players in a variety of ways move them around the field and get them isolated it provides a lot of versatility whether you want to run it or throw it
5854834 its fun to see everybody involved says leach who has turned tech into quarterback u
5854835 you dont know whats going to happen because so many people can get the ball

5854840 we are seeking help and advice of international experts including seaworld in san diego to see if there are any additional techniques or options we can try this is a unique difficult and sad situation
5854841 its not impossible and the fact it is snuggling up to a boat is a good sign it could be done
5854842 and the fact it has never been tried before in the world is a good reason to do it

5854846 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5854847 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5854848 i can refer you to a program where the city will help you pay for it

5854853 the spread between mortgage rates and benchmark treasury yields had been about 1 8 percentage points and now its about 2 8 percentage points
5854854 for at least the next few years were in a world of wider credit spreads even once the credit crunch finally gets put to bed that trend will not reverse itself overnight
5854855 we believe the company could achieve significant operating cost savings
5854856 though it may be challenged to meet its financial targets of 300 million in ebitda in 2009 and positive free cash flow
5854857 until additional information becomes available regarding the ultimate capitalization and the effect of cost saving plans and growth initiatives on secured and unsecured recovery at sirius and xm
5854858 we will not be deterred we will not retreat and we will never surrender the lives of these defenceless whales to the outlaw whalers from
5854859 if the japanese police succeed in arresting any of these three men we will use the courts as a forum to focus international attention on japans continued illegal whaling activities
5854860 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5854861 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5854862 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5854863 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5854864 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5854865 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5854866 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5854867 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5854868 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5854869 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5854870 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5854871 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5854872 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5854873 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5854874 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5854875 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5854876 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5854877 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5854878 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5854879 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5854880 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5854881 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5854882 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5854883 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5854884 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5854885 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5854886 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5854887 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5854888 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5854889 the grand challenge has proven a showcase for the wealth of talent that exists in the uk not just in large defence firms but in universities schools and even garden sheds across the nation
5854890 there is one thing we do on earth that we will continue to do in heaven that is to praise and worship god that is why we view life on earth for those who live jesus as choir practise for heaven to say that praise and worship is the most important category of music is an understatement in light of that fact there is no more important activity of the human heart that to praise and worship god

5854920 vamos a tener que estar muy atentos a c mo empiece la prueba si logra entrar a la pista y por ejemplo saltar la altura de inicio en el primer intento tendr una carga positiva importante desde el punto de vista de la confianza yo estoy convencido de que mi hijo puede saltar sin problemas la marca de corte el tema es que en el momento que l se encuentra donde las cosas no nos han salido como quer amos en el proceso previo vamos a necesitar de estas cuestiones para que tenga una buena jornada tenemos que pegar primero hay que empezar saltando sin fallas en los primeros intentos con cada nulo que haga la confianza que naturalmente uno pierde porque es una posibilidad menos para l se potenciar sin ninguna duda
5854921 creo que germ n puede saltar c modamente 5 65 y a partir de ah todo lo que salte ser excelente esperemos que se repita lo del mundial de jap n del a o pasado donde no alcanzaron los 5 75 y termin entrando con 10 cent metros menos

5854991 every leftwing blogger out there has a field day going on and on about the fact that labour say i said climate change is a hoax they should just get their facts right down at the standard because the facts are i said kyoto is a hoax
5854992 this is a complete and utter hoax if i may say so the impact of the kyoto protocol even if one believes in global warming and i am somewhat suspicious of it is that we will see billions and billions of dollars poured into fixing something that we are not even sure is a problem

5855010 a no good son of a bitch who robbed me blind
5855011 he essentially came from a blues funk and rock corner and it was his ability to bring this attack to a jazz context that always seemed to be the defining factor
5855012 it was this that endeared him to artists like gil for instance although he played on countless sessions he was a great live performer and this is where he stood out whether with sanborn bley or gil evans

5855015 aabid khan was very much the mr fix it of the group
5855016 he preyed on vulnerable young people and turned them into recruits to his cause using internet chat rooms to lure them in then incite them to fight

5855018 the difference is this time guitarist russell lissack has bought an effects pedal that makes his guitar sound like a swarm of angry robot wasps and he uses it to fire off a thrilling and uncharacteristically venomous solo at 2 20
5855019 he has had dramas in relation to bullying he suffered bullying at the start of the year when he was doing his first course and his family dealt with that nothing had materialised in this particular course but it may be that he kept a lid on it
5855020 its been an ongoing thing and its obviously eaten away at him and come to a head on saturday
5855021 there were no outward signs that he was feeling depressed the indication from the family was that he was feeling good and his behaviour was normal
5855022 i think what cases like this highlight is the sustained impact that bullying can have it can impact on peoples relationships their confidence and how they interact with others
5855023 even when bullying might itself come to an end it can have that sustained impact and thats why we need to stop bullying and get that message out and in this case change the way people see those with a disability
5855024 i think it highlights that despite the changes in community attitudes towards people with a disability we still have a lot of work to do

5855133 to date most attention has been given to the plight of women trafficked into the sex trade but we have also found evidence of trafficking into scotland for domestic and agricultural labour
5855134 the case information we have been given also shows there are different methods of trafficking and different routes into scotland
5855135 we have come across an example of marriage being used as a mechanism of trafficking women into scotland for sexual exploitation and we have seen cases of trafficked persons being recovered at the port of stranraer
5855136 without acceptance of their status they cannot access appropriate services or help police with their inquiries
5855137 the fight against trafficking has been very much police led in the uk but we know that many victims of trafficking will never disclose their situation to a police officer because they fear shame deportation or reprisals from their traffickers
5855138 lessons in the alexander technique offer an individualised approach to develop skills that help people recognise understand and avoid poor habits affecting postural tone and neuromuscular coordination
5855139 it can potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
5855140 there is little evidence available about the effectiveness of the alexander technique so this research is welcome
5855141 the alexander technique is something we do recommend and the feedback we have got is good
5855142 high security prisons require constant and vigorous management in order safely to contain and work effectively with their challenging populations
5855143 franklands population had become even more challenging recently with increases in gang affiliations and the arrival of a small number of convicted terrorists
5855144 it is unfortunate that this coincided with the absence of the governor for some months and the resulting drift that was observable at this inspection needs urgently to be reversed
5855145 as the population has an increasing number of black and minority ethnic prisoners bme and an increasing proportion of muslim prisoners it is vital there is more bme recruitment and that all staff receive training in diversity issues
5855146 this will empower staff so that they are able to sensibly confront problem behaviour when necessary while also going a long way to improving relationships within the jail
5855147 it needs to rectify the shortcomings highlighted in this report and make sure everyone in frankland is in a safe environment
5855148 i am concerned about the comments on safety however this should be seen in the context of franklands extremely challenging population

5855485 some of my friends and colleagues are gay and if i was truly homophobic then i have picked the wrong industry

5855488 i can understand the criticism that when the surcharge was introduced it wasnt indexed and there is a real concern about that
5855489 i think thats one of the things that ought to be the subject of discussion and negotiation
5855490 its a question of getting the balancing act right between the public and private health mix
5855491 what im saying is its one of those things that ought to be considered
5855492 its something that i need to sit down and talk to the government about the private health sector the opposition
5855493 i want to see what the impact would be of such a measure on the private health funds and the way it impacts on the public system thats the key to me
5855494 it wasnt done with my knowledge i know nothing about it
5855495 i think that it is negligent that they are not doing it
5855496 the marketing of surf highway 45 is a south taranaki initiative and they are not managing the assets at all
5855497 they have got a gem but it needs a bit more polishing than what they are doing
5855498 if we have got some sort of historical access then the council should be doing whatever it can to secure that for the future once it is gone you cant get it back

5855509 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were very difficult dr forster said
5855510 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5855511 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5855512 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said
5855513 we are committed to do all we can to avoid that

5855525 certainly there will be a lot of changes in our cooperation with nato and we will have changes in the volume the quality and the timeframe in our consultations and meetings

5855584 let the peace of god reign in your heart and be thankful
5855585 ben may not be the best speaker and have the sharpest wit but he is consistent i trust him because everytime i hear him he reveals the word of god to me and i am engaged with a passionate conversation
5855586 i dont understand how this could have happened right before your nose that people are living in the same neighborhood as you and can be this cruel
5855587 we are awaiting the results of an autopsy to determine the cause of death there is a significant acs history in that household
5855588 the family was seen by foster agency caseworkers as recently as august 13th and no problems were found during 2008 the family was seen by both foster and preventive agencies more than 30 times
5855589 those are the years where kids still are kids you want to say theyre adults but they dont behave as adults when it comes to drinking
5855590 theres a lot of things that i think make the debate timely
5855591 whether its our kids giving their lives at 18 to save this country i think the issues about voting and responsibility to vote
5855592 im trying to understand if it should be reduced at all should it be reduced in certain circumstances at certain locations
5855593 colleges already have kids drinking that are 18 19 20 so why not make it legal
5855594 i think there are certain circumstances where people are responsible at 18 to drink
5855595 i dont think 18 year olds of today are responsible
5855596 i dont think it will make any difference because if the kids want to drink at age of 18 theyll drink anyway
5855597 i think people should consider lowering the drinking age and increase the driving age
5855598 i have always been involved as far as outside stuff extracurricular activities cause thats my heart
5855599 i have seen what god has given me and so i just feel like thats always been a good burden on my heart
5855600 it was to equip the two countries uganda and burundi and the first lady of uganda she has a childrens hospital in her village and she needed 37 000 to help build a hospital wing for the kids
5855601 and so that was our purpose in uganda and we helped raise that money in the states in burundi they needed school roofs on three of their schools the sun is so hot there that the kids were literally baking so we wanted to raise 60 000 and that went to them
5855602 as a football player or professional athlete sometimes people see you as a hero or role model but i think now just going to africa made me look at things differently to go over and literally empower a country
5855603 we met the first lady of uganda and to see her face when we gave her money and we gave the president of burundi a check for 20 000
5855604 my daughter just turned 4 and my son 3 and yet what they have already learned as far as life here our lifestyle they kept saying daddy went to give kids toys and i said no daddy didnt give toys they dont need toys they need schools water a hospital its great at a young age to show them that life is so much bigger than them and their world
5855605 my stomach was doing flip flops if i had a weak heart i think i would have had a heart attack
5855606 and thats the pressure only because you want him to reach all his goals
5855607 we work all our lives for this every morning we get up and this is amazing its great
5855608 his work ethic is phenomenal for him to realize his dreams as a father it fulfills everything youve done all the hard work
5855609 when i called him he said but mom why are you not coming and take me and it kills me
5855610 i always thinking im guilty because i sent him this summer back to my country
5855611 during these terrible moments i was even ready to fly there was no flight the georgian airport is just bombarded every day
5855612 they are very aware of these kids and recognize the imperative to get them out of there
5855613 i havent laughed so much since my granny caught her tits in the mangle
5855614 we are only printing a limited number so i cant afford to lose one what i might do is just climb up a stepladder and drop one on the table but then there is the health and safety risk that it might land in the soup
5855615 let the peace of god reign in your heart and be thankful
5855616 maybe if you adoption people would loosen your requirements then maybe you would have an easier time finding these damaged pets nice homes
5855617 first off reputation posterity and cool are traps theyll drain the life from your life reputation posterity and cool fear
5855618 um i just wanted to know what city the hospital was in
5855619 without a reorganization plan in place soon the company could face severe consequences and these same institutions will likely recover far less than under the ripplewood proposal
5855620 we are holding out little hope that this proposal will be approved
5855621 these banks and hedge funds are once again going to disappoint all of the 23 000 employees of interstate just like they have disappointed the nation with the mortgage debacle
5855622 were hopeful that the parties will reach agreement on concessions that would allow ibc to emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a stand alone company
5855623 palmitoyl pentapeptide 3 this exciting anti aging ingredient instructs the body to produce collagen on the areas that you apply it try it and you will notice a firmer plumper skin in as little as 2 weeks
5855624 it is private property if people were cool this would not be an issue
5855625 this is an outrage its a real slap in the face to all the communities who use it
5855626 had contact in may 2005 with an individual in a red jeep grand cherokee
5855627 like a breadcrumb trail so to speak so that you can go back in and follow the dots to where you were
5855628 ill tell you this even though i shouldnt my attorneys and the fbi might get jealous frown face symbol there was a gps unit in the jeep i was driving that was on constantly from the time i left fargo until my arrest at dennys so the police had a very detailed map of everywhere i was or at least where the jeep was during almost this entire time
5855629 pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall without futher thought as to who had taken whom prisoner the frenchman ran back to the battery and pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who it seemed to him were catching at his feet
5855630 mommy are you sure that was me that was way too skinny mommy
5855631 this new law is a message to drunk drivers stop your irresponsible behaviour or you could lose your wheels
5855632 this new law is very important in fighting impaired driving
5855633 the human rights council at the united nations has now banned any criticism regarding sharia law and human rights in the islamic world according to president doru romulus costea and following the efforts of delegates from egypt pakistan and iran the council will no longer tolerate criticism of either sharia or specific fatwas in the name of human rights
5855634 nothing was missing except the most important thing to me and thats the dogs
5855635 i dont know if he was mad because he didnt find anything and decided well the dogs are something
5855636 but my feeling is if they didnt take them theyd be around here
5855637 without reading the report it could be a number of things
5855638 sometimes pets are taken as a result of an argument by somebody that is known to the victim
5855639 it would just be a hassle unless somebody thought they could get some money for them
5855640 it just seems like quite a crazy thing to do to take two dogs that wont really get you much
5855641 it was my first nude scene and it wasnt supposed to be me
5855642 i had a body double and we had some complicating factors with her it was sort of a last minute thing where i said ill just go ahead and do this
5855643 there were couple of things that mommy wanted to eat but could not find or were told not to eat when i was pregnant with you the first one would be breadfruit your mak tok ani said that breadfruit is not good for pregnant ladies because it was windy gassy berangin so i did not the second food that mommy really wanted to eat was ketupat sotong
5855644 we believe that the obsession with idealized beauty and body image is a lifelong burden that takes a terrible toll on all young girls and women in this country
5855645 whats really new here is the sheer extent to which women and girls are now willing to go to be beautiful according to standards perpetuated by a youth obsessed media culture with literally thousands of messages 24 hours a day
5855646 it was the first time i profoundly thought over what getting married and married life really means
5855647 after that i was more ready to tie the knot and was totally sure i wanted to do it
5855648 thats how we survived because we needed it for the warmth to wash ourselves and to dry meat
5855649 the first time you jump into an ice cold lake your legs feel numb and you rush to the surface to get out as soon as possible
5855650 but afterwards its just wonderful you can feel the blood coursing through your veins
5855651 the peace you get immediately after that first shock is what makes you lie back and watch the world go by
5855652 while we were still arguing about modesty and the necessity of wearing swimsuits one of the finns took off his clothes opened a beer and just slipped into the sauna with a sigh of satisfaction
5855653 people are carrying out breeding which would be first of all entirely illegal in humans and secondly is absolutely insane from the point of view of the health of the animals
5855654 the welfare and quality of life of many pedigree dogs is seriously compromised by established breeding practices for appearance driven primarily by the rules and requirements of competitive dog showing and pedigree dog registration
5855655 any dog may be shown but it is up to the judge to decide if it fits the breed standard
5855656 it is when characteristics become exaggerated that health problems can occur
5855657 this will offer an opportunity for carers in queensland to let the committee know more of the emotional financial and social pressures carers face
5855658 the committee will be asking these carers for suggestions on how to make their work easier
5855659 we do have a mandate of our own as well to put forward pieces of legislation which the government has to treat seriously
5855660 i can tell you this if there are questions arising out of legislation if the information isnt available that the senate needs to make a proper decision i have no doubt that the senate will insist that information is made available before the vote on that legislation proceeds
5855661 so it would be judicious of the government to be consulting early giving senators whatever information they require and looking at alternatives coming from the crossbench and the opposition
5855662 county does what it can and state does what it can and if need be we get federal help
5855663 we thought long and hard about the request to make jeremy clarkson the prime minister and in the end we put our thoughts down in a short film
5855664 gordon brown appointed steven carter and his people in january in december 2007 just before their appointment yougov was showing labour just five points behind in the polls which is manageable for mid term
5855665 what women can do is start putting themselves up for promotions and making it quite clear that they actually want to be promoted
5855666 when we women come back into the workplace we are now a person with a visible caring responsibility and thats what actually is impeding on us in our progress to more senior roles
5855667 the fact is that there arent many jobs at the most senior levels that can be done in some kind of flexible manner
5855668 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
5855669 we still have our day jobs theyre just a little more sporadic now because of our nomadic lifestyle
5855670 but alex does carpentry and i am in the service industry very part time now
5855671 actually the day job situation doesnt conflict with the band situation at all because the band is completely devouring my ability of ever working in terms of leaving and coming and going i cant really be considered a dependable employee but i think working is extremely important just to keep yourself balanced and thats not just about money i think thats about energy levels being on tour your energy goes all over the place you really are crazy more or less but then it can make you even more the rhythms are more crazy so i think having a job and knowing that you have to make that deal a couple of times a week keeps you grounded so youre not you know flying into the astro plane
5855672 ive always talked to myself im always inventing scenarios pretty much constantly fantasising about things and i love objects but i like creating little worlds for things and the things make me think of other things i spend a lot of time by myself being by myself playing by myself and i feel like thats still very much there for me i really like disappearing for a little while and being in my own world but i also like being around people so when you combine the two it can be a lot of fun
5855673 devotion is like a long moment its really intense it was an intense process it was an intense year and there were good things and were now just realising that we changed in that time but it took a while to begin i think that theres a lot of memory and intensity but its like a euphoric intensity it comes out it doesnt stay inside it comes out more its more present its not running away from you its there its very thick you can feel it i think
5855674 i think whatever we envision in our minds inspires us things affect us and things happen to us its a combination of just life experiences and also art thoughts art vs thoughts or things that we get hooked on things like that so its a combination its very random you can never really tell where it is specifically but i know that we both get inspired by hearing things seeing things but its never just one like one record would never be inspired by just one thing but we do get into obsessive things like the traffic we came into recently
5855675 im kind of a pirate im not the most healthy when im on tour i drink a lot and im not really protective of my vocal chords as some people would be but i think thats kind of boring i think the training i had in my life probably strengthened my vocal chords and showed me how to breathe and use muscles like my diaphragm and things like that i have a lot of control so i try to use that to my benefit
5855676 in erotic ceramic i do really like visual arts stuff and im really into film but i dont have any concrete talents in that sense i have started growing to realise that when i write lyrics and stuff there usually tends to be little drawings and things incorporated into that because i see things that i wanna incorporate you know like i made a little book for our last tour but thats about as much dabbling ive done just tiny little drawings i think drawing and appreciating the soul making universe is as far as i go into the other arts
5855677 i think time off from the band now is basically thinking about stuff i could be doing for the band not in bad ways but in good ways thinking about ideas having little dreams and stuff is pretty much the idea or swimming shopping buying things trinkets stuff that makes your little universe basically trying to keep inspired is another duty to oneself i think thats important
5855678 ive only played it once i dont have the stuff it takes to play it but i really want to
5855679 i played it once and its really intense cos the musics like techno and it was super loud but i think that thats really the only way you should play it basically like youre in a concert
5855680 if you have that if we ever meet we should play it
5855681 thats totally awesome maybe the reason i like it is because i like lots of little things and i like combining lots of little things and thats a lot of my creative process combining a lot of memories you know its not just a little abstract its not just one little thing it might be but it might also be a collection of things when i think about songs theyre little collections and i think thats probably why that game attracted me because its just a giant ball of chaos but it makes sense sure why not have a boat bubble gum scissors pirate building cat all in one thing you know its really awesome
5855682 or an awesome person a person thats catapulting through life and it doesnt make any sense but its completely hilarious a force of nature basically
5855683 not really knowing anything about it and having great first experiences having no idea what were getting into and probably being blown away
5855684 orange apple and grapefruit juice can stop drugs from entering the bloodstream and getting to work in the body possibly rendering them useless the potential effects are so serious researc
5855685 they were attempting to climb an extremely steep pitch and went over backwards the wife was badly injured
5855686 we ended up dispatching a helicopter to fly her out because we didnt want to risk transporting her down the road because it was extremely rough we flew her out and took the husband down in the emergency response truck he had some broken ribs and such but the injuries were relatively minor compared to his wife
5855687 the man was reported missing by a friend when his empty boat was located early the next morning
5855688 it was about 4 30 in the morning when he jumped off the roof of the houseboat he swam a couple of hundred feet from the boat when his friends realized that he appeared to be struggling and attempted to rescue him using a large inflatable air mattress but he was gone and hasnt been seen since
5855689 because of his actions at the scene and things he said our officers at the scene knew this individual had some mental health issues he was taken to the hospital by police he had to be physically restrained in order to be put in the police vehicle
5855690 he clipped a vehicle just prior to hitting the kelowna residents he missed most of it but caught the bumper then he carried on and thats when he hit the kelowna couple
5855691 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5855692 we know this show is gonna suck and its gonna be more cheesy than any other show before it all people want to see is kelly and brenda together on the screen again and once the cool factor has worn off from that theres no reason for anyone to watch
5855693 jon voight your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5855694 mayers childish behavior only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
5855695 jen was tired of paying for everything cobwebs come flying out of mayers wallet when he opens it john liked living like a movie star when he was with her jen would never say anything but you could tell it irritated her
5855696 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5855697 i wouldnt date any guy who is prettier than me
5855698 who doesnt love a weary looking southern belle with a scowl that could peel paint off a barn i can almost smell her sweet marlboro breath from here
5855699 michael moore has endorsed you but he recently said fill in the blank with some outrageously offensive line taken out of context will you still accept his endorsement or do you denounce him
5855700 it wasnt working out adrian saw her with shia and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out he obviously didnt appreciate it
5855701 first day on set without much interaction she had all the mannerisms pretty much down
5855702 hes taught me what it means to be a songwriter and producer
5855703 the live performance scenes helped me ease into the role made me feel comfortable
5855704 while we were shooting it was me the music director and rainns drum coach
5855705 hey your sic pretty great lets sic elope how do you spell elope i dont know but we should
5855706 i just wanted to say that i saw an advanced screening of the rocker and it was absolutely amazing
5855707 people are going to love that so much you did an amazing job
5855708 we had our first show last night and i turned to the guys i play with and said lets just have fun once you realize how much fun your fans are having it becomes easy to have fun with them
5855709 hes just a really funny guy and i like his style of humor
5855710 and what people may not know is that hes a really really nice dude too good aura
5855711 a lot of whats happened with my career has been because of the internet
5855712 its a way for me to reach fans directly especially with music
5855713 the main lesson learned is we want to make sure to prevent this illness and we can
5855714 i feel good i got a chance to run around at practice yesterday and throw the ball
5855715 i havent had any pain everything im doing they want me to do it pain free that was the case yesterday
5855716 the key thing is to have him as close to full speed as possible because even if he had not had a hamstring injury the chance of most of the guys being 100 percent for game day is remote there is always something nagging
5855717 well do the right things but well take it in that step by step day by day process
5855718 there was no ecological damage we didnt have a fish kill
5855719 it reflects a larger pattern which is his companys record of polluting oregons waterways and his votes in washington to roll back environmental regulation
5855720 the children have kept me going after i do playboy we want to try ivf its asking a lot but if its possible it would make our package complete
5855721 the main lesson learned is we want to make sure to prevent this illness and we can
5855722 the main lesson learned is we want to make sure to prevent this illness and we can
5855723 then jet took him down and said wake up wake up wake up
5855724 i will worry for my beautiful boys if i get unwell i live for them
5855725 its always difficult working away from home but i cant wait around for the doctors to find out whats wrong with me i need to keep working
5855726 i know it sounds crazy and a lot of people will criticize me for it but i have to pay the bills at the end of the day and if i do face cancer i need to make sure i can support the boys
5855727 this time it was awful because when its happened before ive been around people i started getting really bad pain like contraction pains in your abdomen but also lower down
5855728 i was sitting on the sofa and got up to do something and i was just bent over in pain i went up to the bathroom and thats when i saw the bleeding and clotting
5855729 i tried to get into my bedroom to call the ambulance there was just blood everywhere and i started to panic about how to open the security gates and let the paramedics in
5855730 i managed to get down the stairs but i was in so much pain they gave me morphine and air in the ambulance
5855731 all tobacco products must be sold by a licensed retailer
5855732 like anything else if it seems too good to be true it likely is and people are encouraged to avoid these situations
5855733 its all about choice if a woman or a father for that matter makes a choice to take a backward step in their career for a child then thats a matter of choice
5855734 but when its not their choice when the prejudice in the workplace makes that choice for them its a completely different matter
5855735 how could i get smaller but be the same weight
5855736 in order to prepare for the funeral i suspend business of the house until further notice members will be informed as to when the house will resume business
5855737 sadly he has left us at this most trying time his passing on is a sad day for the zimbabwe people
5855738 zambia has lost a visionary a leader who transformed the economy of this country
5855739 a champion of democracy in his own country and throughout africa
5855740 worked tirelessly to uphold the values of good governance speaking out against human rights abuses and threats to democracy when many others were silent
5855741 a huge loss for democracy of which he was an ardent defender all his life
5855742 sometimes they dont give you quite a clear cut result so we have to do further tests on those samples
5855743 i do not deny the holocaust i am not nazi racist white supremacist or anti semite i have tremendous remorse for scaring you
5855744 intolerant anti semitic and frankly despising of dr wiesel and everything he stands for

5855750 the blessings flowing through this belief system cannot be measured
5855751 what is really frustrating is to have a second devastating fire occur in the same area under basically the same conditions despite the amount of information that has been made available over the years through public education programs that promote defensible space
5855752 i wish they would recommend people would clean up their sage brush in their backyard
5855753 a garden hose like that doesnt do anything against a fire like that
5855754 my shirt caught on fire that year thats how hot it was i learned my lesson from that year
5855755 uncontrolled wildland fires pose a serious threat to lives property and natural resources throughout the region
5855756 meet or intermingle with wildland areas of brush grass or timber
5855757 jade was really looking forward to her time in the house but her health is the most important thing
5855758 were seeing that when these ceramic flat irons are used at the highest heat settings and on a daily basis to achieve straight hair they can really take a toll on the structure of the hair and cause very noticeable problems that can be hard to repair
5855759 if you look at the sales statistics you see that people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
5855760 most people on tv and in films have straight hair and its a trend the public is trying to emulate
5855761 the problem starts when they do it wrong or too frequently and they cause a real mess that takes a long time to fix
5855762 todos tenemos la misma sangre egipcia y si el motivo de la medida es prohibir el tr fico de rganos lo rechazamos porque puede ocurrir tambi n entre fieles de la misma religi n

5855770 de platenindustrie is momenteel erg onrustig veel mensen werden ontslagen anderen werden overgeplaatst veel van die mensen waren verbonden aan mijn album ik hoop dat ze vlug zicht krijgen op de zaak ik wil namelijk dat die tweede cd er snel aankomt
5855771 elke keer we er een kind bijkrijgen lijkt het leven leuker te worden

5855774 and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of the healing

5855890 primul serviciu online din romania care face legatura dintre clienti si bloggeri
5855891 proiectul bpp care a incitat marti blogosfera are deocamdata destul de multe puncte neclare pentru a da un raspuns transant in privinta perspectivei succesului sau a insuccesului teoretic da are sanse de succes dar cred ca urmatoarea perioada va fi una de expectativa a advertiserilor inainte de a apela la un astfel de serviciu
5855892 probabil ca dimensiunile pietei sunt sau vor fi de ordinul catorva mii de euro poate in zona zecilor de mii pe an daca comparam asta cu cele 15 milioane de euro din vanzari clasice vedem ca mai e mult pana departe
5855893 succesul unui astfel de proiect depinde esential si de relatiile pe care initiatorii serviciului le au in business si de existenta unei echipe de vanzari marketing performante nu poti sa stai in fata computerului si sa astepti sa vina advertiserii la tine mai ales cand le propui publicitate neconventionala
5855894 mai degraba no name decat celebritati ale blogosferei iar bpp are in primul rand nevoie de bloggeri cu notorietate si cu un numar semnificativ de cititori pentru a convinge advertiserii
5855895 cu cateva exceptii in primul rand din industria auto companiile mari din romania sunt reticente inca in a folosi blogurile drept canal de comunicare promovare personal cred ca sunt destul de putine blogurile romanesti care pot participa onorabil si eficient intr o campanie de comunicare advertising totodata sunt putini specialisti in comunicare capabili sa imagineze si alte mijloace de promovare online in afara clasicelor si enervantelor bannere adaugati si frica de esec intr o campanie online a companiilor care dau banii si aveti peisajul complet
5855896 din punctul de vedere al advertiserului noutatea va pieri destul de repede daca si cand blogosfera se va impanzi de posturi cu plata nu va mai fi asa mare scofala sa lansezi o astfel de campanie
5855897 ideea de posturi cu plata marcate explicit e ceva cat se poate de in regula dar posturile cu plata nemarcate ca atare contrazic recomandarile europene in materie de publicitate si distrug credibilitatea autorului blogurile au in adn contestarea establishment ului si cred ca genul asta de intelegere le submineaza autoritatea foarte tare
5855898 succesul este greu de masurat pentru un asemenea proiect plata per post scris probabil orice client gasit la inceput va fi o dovada a succesului sunt sigur ca se vor gasi oameni de ambele parti clienti si bloggeri care vor apela la posturi platite
5855899 motivul acelasi pentru care se tem de bloguri te feresti sa nu se vorbeasca urat de tine pe bloguri caci altii ar putea vedea acele randuri la fel vrei sa apari intr o lumina buna pentru a fi vazut de cei care citesc bloguri sau ajung pe ele accidental prin cautari un asemenea serviciu scuteste negocieri si discutii individuale in plus la volum mai mare primesti si un discount ar costa mai mult ca timp si bani sa negociezi separat decat in grup
5855900 atat consumatorii cat si ziaristii profesionisti sunt exasperati de stupiditatea si limba de lemn a comunicatelor de pr
5855901 ca intermediar poate economisi resursele advertiserilor decat sa discute o companie cu fiecare blogger in parte mai bine cumperi spatiu en gros si beneficiezi si de un plan de marketing plus ca bloggerii sunt de cele mai multe ori niste creaturi dificile cu care e greu sa te intelegi
5855902 sunt destul de putine bloguri care aduc continut de valoare inteligent care sa le faca respectabile marea masa a bloggerilor este tentata mai degraba de reteta otv in continutul pe care il produce pe de alta parte reticenta companiilor de a comunica pe bloguri se va diminua incetul cu incetul exista destule bloguri care au o audienta mai mare decat varianta online a multor reviste glossy ceea ce nu este de ignorat
5855903 consider ca un blogger primeste intre 100 lei si 75 100 euro cel mai probabil ia 50 de euro pentru un articol reclama
5855904 sumele despre care am auzit sunt sub 50 de euro pe post dar nu am nicio experienta de felul acesta se mai ofera diferite produse spre testare care apoi raman la blogger
5855905 personal nu am primit niciodata bani pe un post din ce cunosc absolut superficial un post pe un blog de succes peste 1 000 de unici zi se plateste cu minim 50 de euro

5855915 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
5855916 well that is our job we dont technically get money for the hours we put in but it is our job
5855917 weve made more progress in the last year than in the 41 years before that and were well within the timeframes of our agreements with the city
5855918 we were successful in negotiating a guaranteed maximum price with them 145 million and now are trying to schedule our closing and construction start
5855919 they felt they were not able to take enough money out of the costs to meet our budget objectives
5855920 suffolk was more confident they could do that and they also have more experience with different construction systems and multifamily developments
5855921 from the signing of that deal we have 12 months to complete design development drawings and 18 months to complete construction drawings
5855922 the next deadline is two years from july 11 2008 to pull a building permit which were doing this month

5855955 the most senior bush administration officials discussed and approved specific details of how high value al qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the central intelligence agency
5855956 what happened at abu ghraib was no aberration but part of a widespread pattern it showed the tragic impact of the initial decision by mr bush and his top advisers that they were not going to follow the geneva conventions or indeed american law for prisoners taken in antiterrorist operations the investigative file on bagram showed that the mistreatment of prisoners was routine shackling them to the ceilings of their cells depriving them of sleep kicking and hitting them sexually humiliating them and threatening them with guard dogs the very same behavior later repeated in iraq
5855957 under the geneva convention it is the united states as a nation which must confront its responsibility for the actions of the men and women representing it in its prisons
5855958 the us justice system is based on the abiding principle that defendants are innocent until proven guilty we would encourage you to remain open minded but skeptical of sensational allegations that have no basis in fact
5855959 there is also the grotesque and deeply shameful issue that will always be a part of americas legacy the manner in which american troops have treated prisoners under their control in iraq afghanistan and guant namo bay cuba there is no longer any doubt that large numbers of troops responsible for guarding and interrogating detainees somehow loosed their moorings to humanity and began behaving as sadists perverts and criminals

5855964 our main businesses operated in markets that were affected by downturns particularly in the us where the downturn was the most severe chief executive louis gries said
5855965 despite this we continued to focus on driving primary demand for fibre cement products in north america with strategies aimed at increasing our share of the us siding and backer board markets

5855975 proportionate ebitda growth of 9 6 per cent in the face of the current external environment represents an excellent achievement and demonstrates the significant value which has been generated by the aeronautical and commercial initiatives map has underway at our airports
5855976 we recognise that our airline customers face challenging conditions but the first half result is evidence of the importance of investing in airports with attractive characteristics and opportunities across the aviation and commercial businesses
5855977 whilst our financial position is very sound we recognise that attitudes towards leverage have changed if not permanently then for the foreseeable future
5855978 consequently we are applying our surplus cash to the repayment of our hybrid capital instrument tickets which will simplify maps capital structure
5855979 whilst there is no provision for early redemption we are offering tickets holders a withdrawal option with any remaining balance to be defeased and repaid on 1 january 2010
5855980 the discount to valuation which the current security price represents remains near record levels
5855981 a buyback of this scale also aids the quality and sustainability of our distributions and our commitment to achieve broad convergence between our regular distribution and proportionate earnings by 2010
5855982 conducted at prices that reflect our full directors valuations generating substantial premia to the prices for maps original investment of 49 per cent for copenhagen and 47 per cent for brussels
5855983 importantly map will exercise joint control over both investments whilst retaining exposure to their future growth
5855984 asur meets maps key investment criteria and we expect the returns from this investment to be well above that offered by current and proposed major airport privatisations
5855985 we believe this investment demonstrates maps continued ability to source attractive growth opportunities
5855986 by the end of the session commodities have given up about half their gains whereas the euro and aussie are still trading close to their highs
5855987 were still bullish on the us dollar but having gone up so rapidly and so much in advance of what interest rate differentials are doing there comes a point where market dynamics suggest that there could be some vulnerability
5855988 the story that we have is ongoing pressure on global economies ongoing pressure on commodities and ongoing pressure on commodity currencies
5855989 it doesnt add up to a very positive aussie dollar picture
5855990 inflation is way too hot and with housing way too cold we have the opposite of a goldilocks economy said joel naroff president of naroff economic advisors
5855991 goldilocks economy refers to economic conditions that are not too hot or too cold
5855992 new building codes enacted by new york city accounted for the big jump in permits and starts in june
5855993 obviously well evaluate him every day he gets in here and see how his knee is holding up
5855994 theres still internal discussions about what were going to do and i should have something for you before we go to baltimore
5855995 we have to wait and see how some things come out and then ill give it to you on thursday
5855996 it feels a lot better than it has which is a good sign its coming out good the more i play catch the better it feels
5855997 i just have it up until saturday and well see how he feels come sunday morning
5855998 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5855999 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5856000 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
5856001 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
5856002 well just try to match up the best way we can
5856003 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out
5856004 i do not necessarily determine the role the relief pitcher determines the role
5856005 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a can any of yall throw
5856006 the reality is true proven guys are not going to get through
5856007 i feel comfortable that the answer when billys not here is in that room
5856008 the guys in there are going to have to step up i think weve got the guys
5856009 were not the only team that goes through this and we have to find a way to get it done
5856010 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5856011 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5856012 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5856013 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5856014 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5856015 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5856016 it wasnt something that i think i was ready to deal with last night
5856017 ive got to do what i can to push it behind me and move on the last thing i want to become is a distraction to this team weve got something way too good going on right now to have to deal with this
5856018 i cant let that happen for my sake and for the teams sake so we can move on and get where we need to be
5856019 i dont think people should be quick to judge b j so what there have been other incidents that obviously shouldnt have happened he knows it i know it like i said monday no one cares worse than him when something like that happens
5856020 its all going to work out i really want to move beyond all this the focus needs to be on how well were playing
5856021 were going to take care of it but again it happens i think weve addressed it in a forthright manner and because of that things will go well
5856022 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5856023 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5856024 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5856025 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5856026 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5856027 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5856028 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5856029 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5856030 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5856031 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5856032 hopefully itll get better in a few weeks and go from there
5856033 surgery is definitely not on my lifetime check list so i dont want to end up going under hopefully i can get back on the field in a couple of weeks
5856034 today when i woke up i could actually sit up in bed rather than roll out the side and fall on my face
5856035 its not 100 percent that hell be ready but its not 100 percent that hell have an operation
5856036 weve got that in between those two weeks to find out
5856037 that would be pure speculation i think that would be easy to fall back on and point fingers id prefer to take the high road and stay away from that
5856038 its something that happens over a long period of time its a wear and tear situation and then finally it reaches a point where youve got to fix it
5856039 to be honest with you i did not particularly see this coming but im not totally shot out of the water by it i understand the background and how many innings hes pitched
5856040 i dont think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out what a central figure hes been on our ballclub
5856041 this is a clear violation of the fundamental rights of individuals to live and practice their faith
5856042 forcing doctors to have to choose between being a doctor and being a christian in the state of california is an outrageous violation of the fundamental rights of every american to be able to practice their faith and not to have to leave their occupation because of it
5856043 this is instead about the thought police attempting to censor christian beliefs and christian perspectives that dont agree with homosexuality were talking about individuals being able to force doctors or other professionals to violate their faith in order to keep their job
5856044 for example lawyers who are engaging in marriage and family law can now be forced to execute documents for homosexuals adopting children
5856045 and individual with a wedding service despite their christian faith to the contrary can now be forced to conduct wedding services and wedding preparations for lesbian or homosexual male couples

5856054 when we women come back into the workplace we are now a person with a visible caring responsibility and thats what actually is impeding on us in our progress to more senior roles
5856055 the fact is that there arent many jobs at the most senior levels that can be done in some kind of flexible manner she said
5856056 what we have to do is we have to start re inventing senior roles

5856100 the maitred in miami asked almost condescendingly as he then scanned the floor of tables for two four and more all mostly without customers and spotted one in a dark corner surely the deuces and four tops would arrive later and be real business it was a bother to him when i said that the table area was too dark for my reading with dinner for i would not be distracted by conversation i was a solo traveler and diner on yet another of my 20 or more trips each year i was a customer who would have a drink perhaps an aperitif before dinner two or three glasses of high margin wine with dinner and would tip for service well above the house average in this miami restaurant i was put off because the maitred evidently did not value me as a customer i skipped the pre dinner drink ordered one glass of wine had an acceptable dinner for 30 when the restaurant would otherwise have had a 60 and high margin customer
5856101 there are millions of me individuals and professionals who travel alone yes in business but more often for pleasure if we like where we are we dont have to listen to someone else about doing something different or going elsewhere solo travelers unlike all other travelers are in control of what they do and buy
5856102 i was greeted by the manager of the restaurant he welcomed me and because he knew that i was an american and a solo traveler asked if i wanted to join others at the community table i agreed immediately and was led to a table set for eight but with five already seated introduced to each of the others by the manager welcomed by them the next two hours were some of the best ever with visiting learning from locals and from the travelers from yet other foreign countries
5856103 why dont restaurateurs and hoteliers throw out all the old rules and do some new thinking

5856106 i think overall we can say that we are over the kaunas result
5856107 itll always be a huge regret of those involved but i now feel weve moved on and can get on with our season
5856108 the obvious disappointment of going out of europe to kaunas was difficult for everyone in the group to overcome
5856109 we felt we really needed a boost and we got that initially with the win over falkirk and then the game with hearts which was an important one because it was the first home spl game of the season
5856110 the addition of mendes in that game was also a factor
5856111 we felt in the close season that we needed to boost the midfield and front areas
5856112 we got the front players in that we wanted to bring in that were within our price range and normally that is the hardest area to fill
5856113 the midfield area proved to the bigger problem in terms of timing
5856114 we had been working away behind the scenes to try to get the players we wanted but we were not able to do so in our preferred time slot
5856115 however we have achieved that now pedro mendes came in last week and young aaron too
5856116 i felt that one of the improvements we had to make was overall possession of the ball and make better use of it
5856117 barry ferguson took the brunt of that but you need the whole midfield to join in and help out
5856118 so i think each of the players we are bringing in will improve us in our overall ability of holding the ball plus the ability to get forward and support
5856119 of course given that we have now increased the squad that will mean some players are going to be unhappy because they are not getting a game
5856120 so some of them may leave during this transfer window and that may be an obvious thing

5856202 because its forbidden a lot of people do it just to defy their parents they do it to excess
5856203 i think we can definitely take some lessons from other countries and do some research certainly binge drinking is a problem and i wish it wasnt

5856207 while english is jamaicas official language most jamaicans speak patois but it does not yet have a standard writing system those opposed to the translation project have argued in the countrys newspapers and other media outlets that formalizing a written standard for patois would undercut efforts to promote standard english

5856224 but the problem is they carry so much baggage along with their corporate name that getting somebody to take a meeting so they can pitch the product is incredibly difficult im not convinced they can ramp the volume
5856225 itll be a lot more valuable out from beneath the sco brand
5856226 we really have a lot of confidence in it its very fast its easy to use youre always connected in real time its talking to a server and its always being updated
5856227 as we move forward at some point well have to answer that question what i can say is im very committed to sco stakeholders to finish off this battle that we started five years ago we believe it is time now to go in and get things finished off
5856228 is what i do meaningful should i keep doing it

5856419 where americas day begins 12 h 2b workers brought to guam from china arent too happy with their stay on guam all 12 employees brought to guam by rongchang company limited incorporated contend they have not been paid for services rendered
5856420 right now there is a review for the proposal and we will be getting a final on that review by next weeks board meeting
5856421 this is a very history for us to try and come out like this and try and vote for the president of the united
5856422 we made the written report the fiscal realignment was not necessary and the transfer of funds was not necessary either so we complied the governors in full compliance i feel
5856423 they told me that id take some time let the inflammation get out of the elbow and when it starts feeling better to start doing more baseball type activities
5856424 right now im going to take some time i can do some light throwing continue to rehab and see how it progresses
5856425 i thought his stint in binghamton was outstanding when he faced our guys over in pittsburgh in talking to the hitters they felt he was throwing the ball very well
5856426 where he is now i dont know but im assuming that we will
5856427 with this increased inflammation more than it showed last time our doctors have recommended that he rest some more
5856428 how much time we dont know were not going to put a specific time on it but billy will be not activated
5856429 wed hoped that we could possibly activate him this week but were not going to be activating him this week
5856430 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5856431 using this characterization my colleagues and i were able to prove that logic programming is not computationally universal in other words there are some concurrent computations that cannot be implemented using logic programming

5856433 oh look everyone has a mobile phone facebook account second life avatar lets use that for educational purposes
5856434 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5856435 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5856436 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5856437 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5856438 most software gets only a few users for a short period why not take advantage of designing with that in mind
5856439 when we started the movement it was a small open mic in the back of a restaurant
5856440 now were an internationally recognized brand with franchises in three continents weve been forced to adapt and change with the times we went from a crew of friends making music to business men with marketing plans and proposals weve grown and had to adopt a more professional approach to what we do
5856441 i feel that eow is successful and able to do a weekly show that never gets dry or old because we love the music and the culture and have a great respect for where its rooted
5856442 we consider ourselves grown men in the hip hop game so we have a seasoned outlook on things one of our matras is maintaining the integrity of the culture that in itself shines through and draws people to the dub
5856443 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5856444 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5856445 we can do this or you can kick this guys ass first
5856446 hell i dont have anything better to do lets see if i have to pee
5856447 im not sure this is gonna happen but lets give it a test run and see what turns up
5856448 wait look what i can do look what i can do
5856449 me oh i dunno how about great yeah thats right i just peed there were like pff i dunno twelve dudes in here just peeing together no problem yeah no shy bladders here
5856450 he was the type of guy who would reheat pizza for lunch
5856451 well if im meant to die by angry cup guy while eating my reheated pizza so be it
5856452 over the last few weeks it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge
5856453 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority gla or the title first deputy mayor
5856454 we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position
5856455 the assemblys role is to hold the mayor to account on behalf of londoners and we will be looking closely at this seemingly shambolic situation to ensure it doesnt affect the mayors ability to run london effectively
5856456 passionate to know christ better hungry to be filled with the knowledge of the truth and desperate to see him lifted high and holy in his her life and in the experience of the church as a whole
5856457 the truth that we gain from the scriptures is wide ranging the treasure is multi faceted and the reward is incalculable
5856458 we love the scriptures because they lead us to christ we are assiduous in our reading of gods word because therein we see the beauty of god revealed in his son therein we taste the soul satisfying sweetness of his redemptive blessings therein we experience the sin slaying power of his indwelling presence in him says paul are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge col 2 3 he is our exceeding great reward oh what an excellent attainment there is in a thorough knowledge of divine truth
5856459 no they told me that id take some time let the inflammation get out of the elbow and when it starts feeling better to start doing more baseball type activities right now im going to take some time i can do some light throwing continue to rehab and see how it progresses
5856460 billy had another mri done today on his left elbow and the mri showed increased inflammation in the tendon area
5856461 we d hoped that we could possibly activate him this week but were not going to be activating him this week were just going to rest him some more and really wed love to have him but the fact is that there was some swelling and increased inflammation and were going to pretty much let him continue to rehab you d like to see less inflammation after rest not more that s the concern
5856462 i dont foresee it being that big of a deal it doesnt feel too bad it just feels like tight muscles
5856463 i have come to find that there are some peculiarities at the minimum if not non compliant documents that were submitted as part of the response to the rfp
5856464 obviously its exciting for the nfl and the jets i will say that it is no small task for him though he has been in one system for 16 years and now to have him do it in such a short period of time its going to be really tough
5856465 when you go from one team to the other its like a different language and you have to learn the coaches the players you are playing with rich and i were talking and favres success in the first preseason game and thats going to wet the appetite of the fan we all are hoping he does great things for those of us that played the position we know how hard it is its been great for the city because thats all we talk about on the radio to be honest with you its not going to be easy i am just trying to temper everyones enthusiasm he has to learn a lot and he cannot just go out there and fling it and be reckless so hopefully that wont be the case
5856466 i think we are ready to see what brett can do on the field we are all tired of speculating about it he is off to a great start he is a great player it was going to be a tremendous void in the league without him especially in his heart because he thought he could still play the mental part will be tough but i think he can go out there and still fling it because he is the best at just flinging it im anxious to see him play i am jealous of his durability i know all us old quarterbacks wish we can go out there and still play in our minds we think we still can until we get out of the bed each morning but i just marvel at his durability
5856467 i think he is one of the five best throwers of the football ever in the nfl i think he is an incredible thrower he can throw off balance it is hard to hit him i think he can deal with the meadowlands after playing in green bay all those years learning the new system i am anxious to see that i am curious to see what happens if he gets hit a lot in new york because he did not get hit very often in green bay just because their style of play and his style of play
5856468 brett is one of the greatest to ever play as far as adapting to the new plays and new terminology if there is anybody in the league that can do it it is him because of the experience he has had for 16 years football is football if you can read coverages the approach to the game and the approach to the offense it is really getting done what you want to get done if there is any guy that can adjust quickly it is him for a guy that has been in one place that whole time its a shame that he wont playing in green bay but on the other hand its a fresh start for him and its going to be a challenge and he is the kind of guy that has accepted challenges his whole career and i think he is looking forward to it
5856469 i dont think anybody can understand the difficulty a quarterback can have entering a new system you have to be able to express to other people your point in that language its like being dropped in the middle of japan and trying to talk to make people understand your language you have to figure out yourself it takes time and what is unique is that this happened during training camp he didnt have the time to learn during the offseason and learn that playbook and know the adjustments of the different receivers and how they are going to react in the heat of the battle when the coverages change you might see some ugly picks some ugly throws in the beginning of the season well thats because he doesnt know the sytem yet if anybody can do it he can but i think he is going to have to commit himself a lot more than he has in past seasons
5856470 stand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the lord
5856471 cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way wherein i should walk for i lift my soul unto thee
5856472 the game is called real racing and its the work of australian developer firemint although thats it running on an iphone the company also has it running as a symbian game on a nokia n95 firemint boss robert murray demoed it to us today the first time its been shown to a journalist apparently and we are properly excited about the game which is on course for a pre christmas release why the graphics are spiffing and the tilt controls knock spots off other iphone racing games so far however its the connected features around the core gameplay that made our jaw drop therell be head to head multiplayer racing over the network or via wi fi which is nice but youll also be able to upload your best times to firemints web based community and even create mini leagues of your friends

5856474 hemos tratado siempre de ir tratando de destrabar la situaci n de los tenedores que est n en condiciones de cobrar
5856475 con muchos problemas porque las prestaciones por las que reclaman el pago de letras no se han podido verificar
5856476 algunos expedientes tienen perjuicio fiscal y hay otros que est n directamente judicializados
5856477 estamos trabajando d a a d a con esto y por eso el viernes pasado tuvimos una reuni n muy importante con el tribunal de cuentas al tiempo que el ministro aramburu tuvo una reuni n en r o grande
5856478 lo que est bien se paga y lo que no se judicializa
5856479 buena predisposici n de algunos tenedores de letras en saber comprender las dificultades ante las cuales nos encontramos
5856480 yo no tengo problemas de que as sea si bien no estoy participando de las reuniones porque realmente los tiempos se me hacen insuficientes pero s nos mantenemos en contacto en forma permanente y si se define de mantener una reuni n semanal no hay ning n problema que as sea
5856481 las se oras se persignan cuando nos ven es rid culo piensan que porque llevan un pantal n com n dios est m s cerca de ellas
5856482 pero la gente piensa que uno llega vestido as por molestar
5856483 y nos cae mal que la gente nos juzgue sin conocer
5856484 son urbanos provienen de barrios parecidos o del mismo centro educativo comparten una est tica y un lenguaje corporal muy influenciado por los medios de comunicaci n se unen en torno a la m sica y sus referentes de autoridad no son tanto los padres como sus pares
5856485 en guatemala hay de todo hasta skinheads cabezas rapadas que se creen nazis o gente straight edge que les gusta la m sica hardcore pero son conservadores no beben no fuman no aceptan las relaciones sexuales fuera del matrimonio y adem s son vegetarianos
5856486 lo que nos gusta es ser rebeldes y no aceptar los estereotipos que nos impone la sociedad yo soy yo
5856487 la mente del adulto est fosilizada y el joven es creativo y din mico por eso busca hacerse visible en un mundo que no le tiene en cuenta y eso lo consiguen poni ndose aquello que el resto del mundo denigra y vilipendia pero que es aplaudido por sus amigos por aquellos con los que comparte gustos e intereses es una forma de decir soy diferente y no me gusta que me impongan
5856488 no son ni mejores ni peores pero lo nico que les preocupa es pasarlo bien la m sica es el nico entorno en lo que se disciplinan
5856489 esta juventud es inconformista de una forma normativa no sist mica es decir se enfrentan al orden social pero no desaf an el sistema no proponen un nuevo modelo de sociedad como los j venes de los setenta
5856490 ahora las expresiones son m s agresivas y eso es un reflejo de una sociedad que vive inmersa en un proceso de violencia la m sica es m s dura y curiosamente en vez de caminar hacia un mayor grado de sofisticaci n vamos hacia respuestas m s primitivas e instintivas
5856491 la m sica es un desahogo cuando gritas sueltas tus frustraciones para m representa un encuentro personal con alguna circunstancia personal que he vivido
5856492 consiste en dar gritos es lo que me gusta la salsa no me llega al coraz n
5856493 pretendo ser una mam moderna y ser su amiga adem s de ponerle normas se lo quer a te ir y yo misma le dije que fuera original porque s que finalmente llegar a una edad seria y adulta as que ahora le dejo que escoja lo que le gusta es parte de su personalidad si le impido que se exprese dejar a de ser ella misma
5856494 mientras vaya bien en los estudios sigamos rezando juntas y yendo a misa los domingos nada me indica que haya problemas
5856495 i feel good i got a chance to run around at practice yesterday and throw the ball
5856496 i havent had any pain everything im doing they want me to do it pain free that was the case yesterday
5856497 the key thing is to have him as close to full speed as possible because even if he had not had a hamstring injury the chances of most of the guys being 100 percent for game day is remote there is always something nagging
5856498 well do the right things but well take it in that step by step day by day process
5856499 everett started swinging the bat playing good defense making a lot of good plays for us and then he gets hit
5856500 it just goes on and on you just have live with it everybody gets beat up
5856501 la m sica es una gran parte de mi alma
5856502 when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
5856503 the way i guess what frontrunner means and the way i think about it is completely different from what theyre using it
5856504 like i said theyre on your side theyre demanding fans everybody knows that when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre not doing good theyre going to let you know we expect better we want better and we want it now and i think they feel that by doing that they can influence the way you play but when youre giving off that negative energy it really doesnt
5856505 people can take it how they want it wasnt a false statement but it wasnt trying to take a cheap shot at anyone either
5856506 its been a long process a long stressful process for me and my family
5856507 the whole system is about helping student athletes be successful and its good to see they are making that happen
5856508 we were getting ready to work a lot more hours developing a backup plan
5856509 en este caso todo es posible la seguimos buscando no descartamos nada tenemos historias de gente que encontramos despu s de muchos a os por eso la esperanza est intacta
5856510 es una l nea probable y en ese sentido aparecieron algunas puntas pero todo eso est muy en pa ales
5856511 si ofrecen un trabajo fuera de su entorno y no le dan informaci n suficiente que los familiares puedan comprobar ante la menor duda que no vaya
5856512 lo que se cuelga en internet no se saca f cilmente el riesgo m ximo es arreglar un encuentro con alguien a quien se conoci por chat
5856513 hab a mucha gente a esa hora pero a n as no sabemos nada relat isabel gainza su madre hay pistas fuertes pero seguimos haciendo cosas como para por ejemplo asegurarnos de que no pase o haya pasado a pa ses lim trofes
5856514 algo que ser a una estafa de realizarse en una sola oportunidad se convierte en una costumbre cuando todos lo aceptan sin resistencia alguna

5856520 washington y mosc tratan a los peque os d biles y divididos estados cauc sicos como simples peones en un juego donde toda la regi n act a como un gigantesco tablero de ajedrez
5856521 los rusos han cambiado de forma dr stica junto con el equilibrio de fuerzas en la regi n le dieron la bienvenida a la oportunidad de mostrar en casa la nueva realidad que era que ellos pod an invadir georgia y los estados unidos y europa no podr an responder en cuanto a riesgo no considera la invasi n como riesgosa militarmente no ten an contrincantes econ micamente rusia es un exportador de energ a que lo est haciendo bastante bien de hecho los europeos necesitan la energ a rusa incluso m s que los rusos la necesidad de venderles a ellos pol ticamente como veremos los norteamericanos necesitan a los rusos m s que los rusos necesitan a los norteamericanos el c lculo de mosc fue que ste era el momento de golpear los rusos se hab an estado preparando durante meses y golpearon

5856523 no son una gran potencia son arabia saudita con rboles
5856524 la rusia zarista era una prisi n para las nacionalidades
5856525 lenin defend a la unidad de los pueblos del antiguo imperio zarista pero ten a que ser una unidad voluntaria por eso insisti desde el principio en el derecho a la autodeterminaci n esta idea frecuentemente se malinterpreta como una exigencia de separaci n pero eso es totalmente incorrecto los bolcheviques no estaban a favor de la separaci n pero defend an la extensi n m s amplia posible del derecho a la autodeterminaci n hasta e incluyendo la separaci n nadie tiene el derecho a obligar a un pueblo a vivir dentro de los confines de un estado cuando la mayor a no lo desea pero el derecho de autodeterminaci n no implica la reivindicaci n de la separaci n de la misma manera que el derecho al divorcio no significa que todas las parejas tengan que separarse o que el derecho al aborto no significa que haya que poner fin a todos los embarazos
5856526 el derecho de autodeterminaci n era una parte importante del programa de lenin en la medida en que demostraba claramente a los obreros y campesinos especialmente a stos oprimidos de polonia georgia letonia y ucrania que los obreros rusos no ten an ning n inter s en oprimirles y que defender an firmemente su derecho a decidir su propio destino pero esto s lo era la mitad del programa de lenin sobre la cuesti n nacional la otra mitad era igualmente importante la necesidad de mantener la uni n del proletariado por encima de todas las diferencias nacionales ling sticas o religiosas por lo que se refiere al partido bolchevique lenin siempre se opuso a cualquier tendencia a dividir el partido y el movimiento obrero en general por nacionalidades
5856527 declaro la guerra a la muerte al chauvinismo gran ruso
5856528 despu s de la revoluci n lenin pensaba que podr a haber una uni n fraternal y voluntaria de los pueblos del antiguo imperio zarista en forma de una federaci n sovi tica

5856559 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
5856560 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
5856561 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
5856562 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
5856563 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
5856564 i guess we the starters are going to play the most we have played in the preseason i thought last game against dallas our intensity and our tempo was there so hopefully we can carry that over into this game
5856565 hes mastered the gameplan he has a great feel for defenses hes been with a lot of different systems so he has a good feel of what we are trying to do he has a good feel for just gameplans in general he is flexible and thats what i like most about him if i have an idea i ask him about it and talk to him about it and if he likes it and we can agree on it we will put it in it has been give and take and i have enjoyed it so far
5856566 any quarterback is going to be kind of the face of the community the face of the program there is a lot of pressure on you youre pulling the trigger and youre making things happen so thats why they pay you a lot of money its a lot of pressure but i enjoy it and obviously things are going well right now
5856567 you have to be a little bit surprised you have the little guy wr eddie royal out there and hes playing well picking up the offense wr brandon marshall is doing great things the offensive line we have all new guys up there we have tommy c tom nalen out c casey wiegmann in we have two guys on the outside the tackles t ryan clady and t ryan harris playing at a high level running backs anybody we are putting in there is rushing the ball well just the volume of plays and the formations we are throwing at them its been incredible how everyone has picked it up
5856568 yeah eddie royal is falling right into place he listens if i tell him something he is going to do it right after the play if i want to tweak it or if i want to back shoulder him i just talk to him about it and the next play he does it it is going well when brandon gets out of his suspension we are going to need him and we are going to need a couple other guys to step up because it is going to be hard to replace what brandon does for us on the field
5856569 i have been talking to aaron since the whole thing has blown up i met him in tahoe when things started getting crazy for him i think he is handling it great he is a down to earth guy he understands the situation and he is playing well right now i wish him the best of luck and i am excited to see him play
5856570 jake we obviously didnt make as big of a deal of retirement as brett favre did he kind of went quietly and that is the type of guy jake is a first class guy he understood what was going on and he kind of wanted out anyway i cant imagine being in that situation having a guy like brett favre with what he has done on the field and all of his accomplishments taking over for him it is a tough situation it is like the guys that had to take over for john elway and dan marino it is tough they are always going to be there and you are always going to hear about brett favre as long as he is in a uniform
5856571 i met him a few times when we played and when i was down in tahoe he is a good guy he is cool we talk every once in awhile a couple times a week just to see how things are going if he throws a pick i give him some trouble and if i throw a pick vice versa he will probably send me a couple text messages
5856572 that is not necessarily true if you go back and watch a lot of clips from three four or five years ago youll see a lot of empty sets they were throwing the ball all over the place especially with john elway they threw their fair share of deep balls in empty sets right now with our running game when we get in those sets you are going to see limited amounts of defenses they have to prepare for our run and that kind of limits their blitz and what they can do if we go empty with their checks and stuff as long as we are running the ball we are going to be able to do things like that
5856573 i dont know if brandon has ever been covered on third downs if we ever go into a three receiver set and he gets in there he is the guy that they have to cover and that is not an easy task for any nickel guy he understands what we are trying to get done and he understands the defenses and where the openings are at its fun having him out there especially for a guy like eddie royal and even for a guy like brandon marshall because he has been around the league and he has been around some great offenses
5856574 not in my mind if we run the ball like that against dallas i cant see why we cant run against anybody
5856575 you have to be ready to go in and you have to play like youve been working with the first team all year
5856576 we give him a hard time for his age but when youre on the field that ball definitely has a young guy pop
5856577 thats the thing that gets your attention when youre first looking at him last winter
5856578 thats the first place you always go before the feet or anything like that you say does he still have an arm can he still make all the throws what you see him do is throw from a lot of different platforms whether its straight over the top or three quarters or submarine i kid him about throwing it submarine style sometimes
5856579 i think its just part of my mechanics now being able to make throws from different angles
5856580 i dont want to sound cocky but theres not many
5856581 ive seen guys do 10 000 more reps than i have and done band work and everything but i can still come out and throw the ball so its just something that i was given its like a guy being able to jump through the roof its just a god given ability
5856582 its been a really great career and really a lot of fun
5856583 its been hard at times and sometimes you feel its not always fair and youve just got to move on from that one good thing i have is a great family and a good support system it really helps me get through anything that could go wrong if you get cut or anything like that it makes you realize its still a business just thank god im 37 and still being able to do what i love to do i have a lot of friends in the nfl who havent been as lucky
5856584 whether its older ladies or middle aged women or young girls the show reached a lot of people
5856585 i think theres the start of a chemistry but it takes time to develop that
5856586 the more you can play together the better that chemistry is the biggest thing is i think were similar in a lot of ways i think we can both bring the pressure off the edges
5856587 which guy do you slide to which guy do you chip how are you going to chip only one of them
5856588 really if you look at andre hes got to be excited because he has been chipped most of the year in the past
5856589 well come off the field and ill tell him whats going on my side hell tell me whats going on on his side
5856590 this last game i told andre he could beat the guy inside he was telling me what jets tackle was doing over there you share that knowledge so throughout the game youll know what to expect when you get over there
5856591 i think people get the idea of being a leader a little messed up
5856592 a leader just doesnt come in and start saying things and breaking chalkboards and throwing bottles around the locker room it starts with your play im not a big rah rah guy thats high school stuff the pregame talks and win one for the gipper id rather go out there and play hard and show them the way to do it there comes a time where you have to stand up and grab someone by the face mask and get things going and that just comes naturally i think when you talk too much you lose credibility when you do the right thing your words carry a lot more weight
5856593 when you know what youre doing and youre confident in what youre doing and you prepare yourself you can be relaxed and kind of kick butt when you have to we cant walk around the street sacking people in the grocery store and being jerks youve got to be personable but on sundays we can turn it on and get it done
5856594 its a day at a time in this league life is so short so im going to enjoy this media session and go get ready to practice and enjoy that and hopefully see you tomorrow
5856595 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5856596 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5856597 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5856598 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5856599 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5856600 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5856601 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5856602 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5856603 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5856604 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5856605 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5856606 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5856607 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5856608 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5856609 os jornais brasileiros v m colhendo nos ltimos anos uma s rie de boas not cias como o aumento de circula o e da capta o de investimentos publicit rios mas s o grandes os nossos desafios sobretudo aqueles relacionados ao reposicionamento das empresas jornal sticas diante das novas m dias nosso futuro depende dessa capacidade de permanente atualiza o
5856610 o jornalismo online brasileiro tem sido um dos mais din micos e criativos do mundo e nos primeiros anos esteve frente at de muitos pa ses mais avan ados pelo menos num aspecto fundamental entender que n o se tratava simplesmente publicar na web o mesmo conte do do papel mas sim de adiantar hoje o conte do do jornal de amanh
5856611 the reason for the game was for the young players to start having international experience for the 2010 world cup
5856612 first we have to find a coherent group then start putting people in positions to get them to play better
5856613 in the second half we played better and created more space for our key players and took over the game

5856620 when her husband went into the fitting rooms my baby started crying so i naturally proceeded to breastfeed her
5856621 shes not a real gamer shes just an attention whore
5856622 if mccain is running a campaign based on personal destruction hes doing it because thats the choice he made
5856623 sure mccain is running an absolute gutter campaign comprised of baseless attacks and random incoherent statements but its not his fault mccain isnt responsible for mccains campaign or his own words and actions
5856624 brooks is a conservative who admires mccain so i suppose even this level of criticism is sort of admirable
5856625 what gives these people the right to decide which graffiti can stay or go why did they not want people to see it
5856626 it appears sinn fein wants our family silenced and they are using any tactic they can to get us to go away
5856627 its as if we are fighting the occupation and the sinn fein leadership at the same time
5856628 they marched on sunday with their anti internment and the struggle goes on banners but yet they actively removed slogans calling for the support of jailed republicans
5856629 these slogans are as valid as the anti internement graffiti of 30 years ago they are the struggle continued
5856630 sinn fein brought this march to derry in order to hit our support base which they know is growing they are trying to curtail this support by any means necessary and this is further evidence of that
5856631 our elected representatives are currently fighting the legislation these four men are held under and we oppose internment in all its forms however on sunday sinn fein activists had more to do organising and running a very successful commemoration than to be thinking of graffiti
5856632 that would be pure speculation i think that would be easy to fall back on and point fingers id prefer to take the high road and stay away from that
5856633 its something that happens over a long period of time its a wear and tear situation and then finally it reaches a point where youve got to fix it
5856634 to be honest with you i did not particularly see this coming but im not totally shot out of the water by it i understand the background and how many innings hes pitched
5856635 i dont think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out what a central figure hes been on our ballclub
5856636 i think it is wholly inappropriate that people should display any kind of weaponry whether it is replica or not
5856637 symbolism like this should not be used particularly from our partys perspective
5856638 jeffrey donaldson should be more concerned about removing real weapons from unionist paramilitaries rather than criticising an historical commemoration committee for using replica weapons
5856639 his comments are in stark contrast to his reaction when more than 100 armed loyalist paramilitaries attacked nationalists during a bonfire in coleraine on august 9
5856640 we appreciate the effort chris has put into this role however this is a performance oriented business when the results are not meeting the expectations we have to make changes
5856641 travis is another example of our willingness to promote from within his depth of knowledge as a racer and engineer as well as his proven ability to work with both drivers and crews will be a great addition to the entire mobil 1 team

5856651 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
5856652 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
5856653 new book out and making the move to open access
5856654 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
5856655 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5856656 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5856657 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
5856658 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
5856659 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
5856660 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
5856661 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
5856662 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
5856663 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality

5856667 ive never had to deal with it on that level its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5856668 paul he when among you accurately and stedfastly taught the word of truth in the presence of those who were then alive and when absent from you he wrote you a letter which if you carefully study you will find to be the means of building you up in that faith which has been given you
5856669 the former proclaim christ out of rivalry not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment
5856670 i may hear you are standing firm in one spirit with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel and not frightened in anything by your opponents
5856671 but recall the former days when after you were enlightened you endured a hard struggle with sufferings sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction and sometimes being partners with those so treated for you had compassion on those in prison and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property since you knew you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one
5856672 may the god of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another in accord with christ jesus that together you may with one voice glorify the god and father of our lord jesus christ
5856673 preach christ from envy and rivalry the former proclaim christ out of rivalry not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment
5856674 having a realistic view of who you really are take the lead in going out of your way to raise others up and push them forward ahead of you
5856675 let each of you look not only to his own interests but also to the interests of others
5856676 for if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing he deceives himself
5856677 did not count equality with god a thing to be grasped
5856678 obedient to the point of death even death on a cross
5856679 therefore god has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name so that at the name of jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
5856680 when we show our body without prudence without modesty we are prostituting ourselves
5856681 it gives rapists permission to say well she had on a miniskirt

5856683 noyes has threatened to kill me and my family and will not rest until we are dead all the evidence you need is in his computer and that little girls mind please save her
5856684 extreme punishments such as locking her in a closet with no food for three days
5856685 these children have a very serious infection that is causing tissue necrosis the death of the tissue
5856686 its not like it is in older children and adults where its generally an invasive group a strep but indeed it is a necrotizing tissue destroying infection that theyve got
5856687 the review has not in any way turned up anything that would cause concern for mothers to be and the lethbridge region
5856688 if we had any concerns that there was something related to the hospital its dr mustos responsibility to shut the hospital down
5856689 in this particular incidence weve not been able to uncover the source of the infection
5856690 because its such an unusual event that there is two of these children that have such a significant infection we thought it wise to ask for another review of this and this is normal practice
5856691 ive never posed naked before or even thought of playing with a vibrator
5856692 the outside shopping it has a very refreshing and relaxing atmosphere

5856708 it is very difficult to positively determine how many counterfeit batteries have started fires
5856709 in fiscal year 2007 customs seized us 200 billion dollars worth of counterfeit goods by midyear 2008 shipments seized had risen 28 percent over the same time period last year
5856710 based on user reports collected so far the iphone 2 0 2 software update does not address 3g issues however as we dont have detailed release notes from apple its unclear as to what 2 0 2 specifically addresses
5856711 so far i am pleased with this update on screen keyboard responsiveness and contacts performance seem improved
5856712 the iphone 2 0 2 software update improves communication with 3g networks
5856713 i never noticed any iphone specific connectivity issues to begin with
5856714 by no means am i saying that the iphone 3g is perfect
5856715 i have also experienced random slowness and or crashing with every build of the software including the 2 0 2 update i have also had serious qualms with the iphone 3gs battery life the 2 0 2 firmware hasnt been out long enough for me to know if battery life is any better with it
5856716 im sure that there are some people who arent happy with their iphone 3gs maybe they have defective units maybe they have poor at amp t coverage in their areas or the network is overloaded
5856717 hinzman joined the us army in early 2001 partly out of a sense of patriotism and adventure however he was primarily attracted by the promise of financial support for a university education he says that more than a year after joining he realized that he could not become a killer he felt he could not dehumanize the people he was supposed to shoot he applied for conscientious objector co status in august 2002 but his command threw his application away hinzman subsequently reapplied while serving in afghanistan only to have his application turned down in afghanistan while his co application was being processed hinzman played a non combatant role as an assistant to haliburton employees serving meals to soldiers upon denial of his application for co status hinzman was ordered to return to active duty when his unit returned to the us with the understanding that they would soon be sent to iraq hinzman deserted crossing the canadian border in january 2004 with his wife and young son and claiming refugee status

5856735 americans have been paying a greater share of their health care costs over the past several years primarily because employers who cover nearly 60 percent of insured individuals have been shifting more of the rising cost burden onto them by requiring them to pay a larger share of the premium raising co payments changing plan designs and reducing benefits some of those tactics are designed to make people think twice before running to the doctor the idea behind such plans is that consumers who have more skin in the game will spend those dollars more wisely
5856736 my son went to his first drama lesson and he turned to his teacher and said dont worry im a really good actor its in my genes

5856741 and further by these my son be admonished of making of many blogs there is no end and of much reading of blogs is a weariness of the flesh
5856742 why we arent emergent by two guys who should be
5856743 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement
5856744 the giveaway of course was that no trace of jack links beef jerky was found in the alleged bigfoots digestive tract
5856745 dont let these tattoos fool you im straight edge im a man of great discipline i dont drink i dont smoke i dont do drugs my addiction is wrestling my obsession is competition
5856746 because the city responded so quickly and the street was blocked to traffic no one was injured and im not aware of any public or private property damage
5856747 our inspector was at this location on saturday and everything was in good order but all it takes is for one vehicle to slam on the brakes
5856748 if the bus had gotten any closer it definitely would have fallen into the ditch
5856749 hes one of the best coaches ive seen hes no nonsense hes straight to the point hes a defensive minded coach i think the fans up in portland should feel very confident about the team they have up there because they have a coach whos not going to let them slip and theyre going to be dangerous
5856750 nates strength when he played was defense and this team definitely has his characteristics of playing defense and having fun playing defense
5856751 the trail blazers definitely have a great coach in nate and they have a very good team and nate is a catalyst for it im happy im able to play this whole summer with him

5856760 to have insured nearly a half million people in less than two years is nothing short of remarkable
5856761 is incorrect because only are based on mathematical models and presented results at scenarios that do not include for example solar activity
5856762 if i had to bet my life on it id bet it is joe
5856763 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
5856764 never mind that thomas already had been confirmed by the senate to three different positions including the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit the second most prestigious court in the land after the u s supreme court before he was nominated to the supreme court
5856765 never mind that he had accomplished all this after overcoming more personal adversity than any other sitting justice has endured sen obamas comment simply ignored facts and history
5856766 they reveal that obama is ignorant of facts and history misunderstands the constitution and contradicts himself in his own alleged criteria for supreme court nominees
5856767 first of all i think justice clarence thomas is one of the best appointments that have been made by republican presidents or any presidents for that matter in recent times
5856768 ill tell you why hes the only justice on the supreme court who prior to his appointment had recognized the relationship between the declaration of independence and the constitution that the constitution is a means of indicating the inalienable rights that are traceable to our creator
5856769 his is a tougher question only because i find him to be a very compelling person you know in conversation individually
5856770 just kind of sprung full bore out of this guys head
5856771 but while van sack did address fainting at obama rallies she made no comparison to other campaigns as freddoso claims
5856772 enough of the voters appreciated my earnestness and youthful swagger
5856773 an image right there of the leaning tower of pisa and the washington monument you tell me why those two phallic symbols are placed there

5856775 we made this very melancholy blood and tears record but we called it achtung baby and dressed up like pop stars to get people away from that because there was just so much melancholy in it with u2 the packaging is often disinformation
5856776 the new roaming deal between hutchison and telstra is a significant shift in telstra strategy regarding its next g network
5856777 this now means that competitive coverage differential between all four operators has now closed
5856778 the question for investors regarding this deal is what has changed telstras mind was it a risk of softer hutchison wholesale revenues or is it a case of telstra believing the speed differential on next g is sufficient that three is not seen as a threat
5856779 our roaming prices will come down as a result of this deal
5856780 there is potential within the joint venture with telstra on your own or any other alternatives
5856781 we have always said that we would consider commercial proposals for wholesale access to our 3g 850 next g network and we have done just that

5856783 the industry wide results were pretty predictable the main change in the dynamic during the year would be the aggression of optus
5856784 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

5856799 the new roaming deal between hutchison and telstra is a significant shift in telstra strategy regarding its next g network
5856800 this now means that competitive coverage differential between all four operators has now closed
5856801 the question for investors regarding this deal is what has changed telstras mind was it a risk of softer hutchison wholesale revenues or is it a case of telstra believing the speed differential on next g is sufficient that three is not seen as a threat
5856802 our roaming prices will come down as a result of this deal
5856803 there is potential within the joint venture with telstra on your own or any other alternatives

5856839 we are excited to reveal the first details of shattered horizon fans of 3dmark have been asking us to make a game for many years were working hard to create something new different and very very fun
5856840 in zero gravity the player is set free to play in new ways
5856841 complete freedom of movement and unique level design create an experience that is at once familiar to anyone who loves the fps style and yet strikingly different to any game theyve played before
5856842 players will be awed by the epic sight of countless asteroids circling the earth our stunning lighting effects create the look of real space for both the natural and man made objects weve taken existing concepts in weaponry propulsion and spacesuit design to make the world of shattered horizon even more convincing and believable

5856844 im calling again from collegehumor when are you going to review the big foam shocker hand we sent you
5856845 we try to do something right we mess it up we die we frikkin
5856846 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5856847 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5856848 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5856849 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5856850 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5856851 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5856852 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5856853 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5856854 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5856855 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago

5856876 being still a little bit on the fence between mccain and obama its kind of nice to hear straight from the candidates mouth what hes standing for as opposed to all the papers and hearing a different story from every paper i read

5856878 im concerned about binge drinking on college campuses im concerned about drinking and driving im concerned about responsible drinking and want to be sure we have the best public policy in place
5856879 maybe those under 21 could be limited to beer beverages only no hard liquor
5856880 you could take a 30 year old person who has never drank before put them at a christmas party give them a few drinks and they might react the same way an 18 year old would because theyre not educated about it
5856881 the next election has not been scheduled until october of 2009 and who knows mr dion may wish to wait longer than that
5856882 i would say that my looks are not what i want to be known for among the shareholders in my firm and other lawyers in the community
5856883 its demeaning and sexist i think we should sue them
5856884 denigrated the litigants whose case he decided and subjected our justice system to ridicule
5856885 i could not understand what would motivate you to do this for what is really a paltry sum whether it was arrogance or hubris the citizens of schererville and more generally of indiana deserve better
5856886 would confer so little value on the corporation that it could only be approved upon showing that the suit is virtually worthless
5856887 you can use software that monitors instead of blocks or filters or you can trust that youve hired the right people and that employees who waste time will always be outed by employees who are doing the right thing
5856888 that is something very serious not just for georgia it is very serious for russias reputation around the world but the political consequences of this are over the more medium term and russia is finding itself isolated even from some of its traditional allies
5856889 the british policy is founded on very clear foundations that the rule of force does not replace the rule of law and the territorial integrity of sovereign nations is to be respected
5856890 on several counts russian behaviour over the last ten days has violated those principles it was striking to hear all nato members talking about the need to ensure that aggression does not pay
5856891 russia wants to be a respected international player but it can only be so if it lives up to its responsibilities
5856892 russia has been after the demise of the georgian government undermining and for the destruction of the georgian state their activities clearly show that they are after infrastructure they want to strangle the government in tbilisi
5856893 they want to demoralise my people and put it into panic and they want to basically not only get rid of the georgian government but get rid of the idea of all ideas of georgias independence and freedom
5856894 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5856895 were not doing this as a good public policy process

5856897 this is a great opportunity to address a major challenging issue for parents and families
5856898 it also gives employers a chance to provide this coverage and employers dont have to pay for it
5856899 assessing the condition of oil related infrastructure cleaning up oil spills or other environmental damage at oil facilities engineering design and repair or reconstruction of damaged infrastructure assisting in making facilities operational distribution of petroleum products and assisting the iraqis in resuming iraqi oil company operations
5856900 the fact that the department was planning for the possibility that it would need to repair and provide for continuity of operations of the iraqi oil infrastructure was classified until march 2003
5856901 this prevented earlier acknowledgement or announcement of potential requirements to the business community
5856902 the u s considered such contingency planning necessary because of saddam husseins actions in kuwait in 1991 when iraqi forces damaged 750 wells
5856903 that destruction resulted in an environmental disaster as well as a tremendous blow to kuwaits oil production capability
5856904 from behind the obsidian mirrors of his wraparound sunglasses ray rodon surveys the vast desert landscape of southern iraqs rumailah oilfield a project manager with halliburtons engineering and construction division kellogg brown amp root rodon has spent months preparing for the daunting task of repairing iraqs oil industry working first at headquarters in houston and then out of a hotel room in kuwait city he has studied the intricacies of the iraqi national oil company even reviewing the firms organizational charts so that halliburton and the army can ascertain which iraqis are reliable technocrats and which are saddam loyalists
5856905 rodon represents the vanguard of what is expected to be a growing army of halliburton employees in iraq where the u s is preparing to embark on the grandest exercise in nation building since its occupation of japan after world war ii at the center of that undertaking will be u s companies with halliburton probably chief among them
5856906 indeed texans wearing kbr baseball caps are arriving by the planeload at kuwaits airport
5856907 the liberation of iraq couldnt come at a better time for halliburton whose business has been dogged by a host of troubles from a slowdown in domestic oil production to nightmare asbestos litigation last year revenues declined 6 to 12 6 billion and the company reported a net loss of 984 million but ceo dave lesar who took over when his predecessor dick cheney went to washington is starting to put halliburtons problems behind it he has cut costs sold unproductive assets curtailed money losing overseas operations and devised a bold plan to settle asbestos related lawsuits
5856908 the dod through its us army logistics civil augmentation program logcap iii contract with kbr tapped the company in november 2002 to develop the contingency plan implementation of the plan is being executed through a separate contract kellogg brown amp root now holds with the us army corps of engineers
5856909 kbr was selected for the iraq contract based on the fact that kbr is the only contractor that could commence implementing the complex contingency plan on extremely short notice
5856910 we made the contract broad enough so we could handle issues just like this
5856911 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
5856912 wagner cant get a cortisone shot because doctors fear he could blow out the elbow if heads back out to the mound without them knowing the full extent of his injury

5856917 we are very excited about the synergy of these two products and the benefits this system provides to both clinicians and patients
5856918 bio mini revo and the associated extended length drill guides provides the surgeon with a safe and effective method to repair the labrum
5856919 the bio mini revo technique and extended length instrumentation greatly aid in hip access and minimize the risks of failed anchor fixation
5856920 as hip arthroscopy continues to develop as a surgical specialty and labral repairs in particular become more prevalent we anticipate that the bio mini revo suture anchor will become an important part of our continuously expanding hip product line
5856921 we are excited that this safe and effective implant which has already been used successfully in thousands of surgeries in the shoulder will now be available to our customers for use in the hip
5856922 gum chewing may stimulate nerves in the digestive system triggering the release of hormones and increasing the production of saliva and digestive juices from the pancreas
5856923 analyzed five trials that included 158 patients who either chewed gum for five to 45 minutes three times a day or didnt those who chewed gum passed gas a little more than half a day sooner and had a bowel movement 1 1 days quicker than those who didnt chew gum
5856924 hospitals face enormous challenges with the quality and accuracy of their clinical documentation and the rac findings confirm this issue many times the documentation is not sufficient to generate appropriate codes
5856925 the provation system produces preliminary codes tied directly to complete supporting documentation and streamlines the coding and billing process for busy him professionals this directly impacts rac preparedness allowing facilities to minimize their exposure without draining him resources
5856926 healthcare professionals have coalesced around the shared goal of reducing preventable infections and that movement has gained additional urgency as healthcare facilities face the oct 1 reduction of medicare reimbursement for certain hospital acquired conditions
5856927 teleflex medical has created a valuable resource with firstdonoharm com a non commercial site thats designed to help medical professionals address the patient professional and financial dimensions of this problem
5856928 in the clinical setting safety takes many forms and infection protection is a major consideration when it comes to central line safety
5856929 i am pleased to have the opportunity to reach so many medical professionals online with information on this topic as we all work to eliminate hospital acquired infections

5856932 the states failure to recognize my years of military service is the worse aspect of the whole situation
5856933 it discredits my twenty years of patriotic service to my country
5856934 the state of missouri can by forcing me to assume an identity other than my assumed name lead to the loss of my military retirement income as well as my medical benefits
5856935 adding a federally issued military id to the list of acceptable documents would bring this issue to a close
5856936 i am of the personal opinion that a military id should be enough of an identification
5856937 warner bros production and anticipated release of the watchmen motion picture violates 20th century foxs long standing motion picture rights in the watchmen property
5856938 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in the watchmen and enjoin the release of the warner bros film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property
5856939 it is our companys policy not to comment on pending litigation and thus will not comment on the specifics of this case
5856940 that said the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation
5856941 we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project

5856979 no one in the west who has seen what is happening in kosovo can doubt that natos military action is justified you need only ask anyone who has seen the tear stained faces of the hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming across the border heard their heart rending tales of cruelty
5856980 i think people in both the united states and in the united kingdom and elsewhere in western europe will have to ask very clearly how important is georgia to them
5856981 there was a lot of talk about how georgia should join nato and if only georgia was a member of nato this wouldnt have happened and so forth i think that is frankly totally unconvincing
5856982 the united states britain france and germany are not going to go to war with russia over south ossetia however sympathetic to the people of georgia we are
5856983 we are sympathetic to tibet we are sympathetic to zimbabwe but we dont contemplate military solutions to these problems so nato membership is not the answer

5856991 i think only certain people can pull that off i would just look homeless wearing them
5856992 i would totally try wearing it but id probably have to go to the levis store to buy some 501s i wouldnt wear them with high heels or anything id keep it casual with a fitted shirt and flip flops
5856993 that judge holland or tom oconnell deprived charles hood of his constitutional rights by not revealing this romantic relationship prior to his capital murder trial
5856994 its the only way we feel were going to be able to get to talk to judge holland and the former dist attorney tom oconnell
5856995 in the past movie studios havent offered wall street the opportunity to participate in their biggest and best films
5856996 there is a lot of interest because of the quality of product we have
5856997 let us try to define the mental attitude in which a practical problem appears
5856998 looking at it from a fans point of view id probably boo myself too
5856999 the fans have a high expectation and so do i and the coaching staff
5857000 this is the nfl its part of the game theres no one to blame but myself im the only who can really stop the boos
5857001 cmon people we havent even started playing games that count yet its extremely unfair were talking about the first quarter of our first preseason game at home the bottom line is we all need to improve offense defense and special teams we shouldnt be hearing boos especially at this time we should be hearing encouragement
5857002 i have an appointment with the quebec national library in order to read the trail of the stanley cup by charles coleman and also another from andy obrien
5857003 i just wanted to add that my sources for information on these dates and facts were culled from the book
5857004 i need your help in creating a french speaking nha club for the city of montreal i want to call them the canadiens do you wish to be a part of this
5857005 in 1908 kendall had begun investing in boxing a sport that had a bad press at the time
5857006 this is product extension at its best where the new products ipod and iphone are helping bring new customers to existing computer products
5857007 the fact that apple is not dependent on the windows vista operating system hasnt hurt either
5857008 jessica went from a size 8 to a size 4 pretty quickly
5857009 the baby always comes first but jessica definitely set goals for herself
5857010 jessica has made amazing progress in a very short time
5857011 the assumption of obamas critics is that a president should always reduce complex issues to simple black and white truisms unfounded in reality thats why they supported bush and thats why theyre supporting mccain
5857012 we dont really have a lot of good options at this point
5857013 we certainly expect that the russians would return any equipment that is u s equipment and return it quickly if in fact they do have it
5857014 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5857015 the alliance has to take a united firm position but without being aggressive
5857016 clearly shows that nato intends to support the territorial integrity independence and sovereignty of georgia and to support its democratically elected government
5857017 is trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5857018 every day several episodes still occur when our servicemen detain georgian troops
5857019 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5857020 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5857021 no specific decisions on programs or projects have been taken but i think one can assume that that question will need to be provided with an answer soon
5857022 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5857023 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5857024 i cant trust anybody who doesnt have an american name
5857025 he has to reach out to our leaders not just the officials in denver
5857026 i cant trust anybody who doesnt have an american name
5857027 we attract people who are willing to dig in the dirt for a living and we attract people who just want to ski on the slopes
5857028 mccains too old and obamas too controversial and he has no experience
5857029 were in a war whether we like it or not and obama has no experience
5857030 i cant wait for us to get out of iraq our troops are just stretched so thin
5857031 we need to find ways to save earth for future generations
5857032 even at 60 a barrel oil will still be profitable
5857033 i get the feeling he doesnt know what hes talking about
5857034 he wants to start offshore drilling i dont know if thats the right thing to do
5857035 its not much a reason to vote for mccain but im just not voting for obama
5857036 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american
5857037 they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
5857038 that came to conduct the operation had air cover this air cover was american helicopters they shot at the police in protection of their unit
5857039 these violations represent a violation of the law they claim they have come to implement
5857040 im the president of diyala university and ive done nothing wrong
5857041 told him to shut up and started shooting down the doors upstairs
5857042 its a key metric that shows market penetration and customer use
5857043 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
5857044 when was the last time you watched 10 000 movies you know i dont care how many movies are available to me as my personal taste as a customer i want to watch the new stuff so whether we have 10 000 movies or 200 movies it doesnt matter if i dont want to see any of the movies that we have
5857045 is heavily weighted toward newer releases and mainstream staple titles

5857050 oh no we dont fill we put 15 dollars in for you dont worry though we used premium the car was barely above 1 4 of a tank
5857051 put your car in reverse or your battery will die
5857052 what if instead of ac shelby and ford power it was mgb and small block chevy
5857053 for withdrawing his illegal self dealing employment contract signed by the mayor amp council 11 hours before a municipal election
5857054 honestly i feel like any one of those three could win the gold medal
5857055 thats how good they are and thats how much depth we have
5857056 but you cant count kyle out because hes three time world champion so from a mental standpoint hes very strong and then you have mike day whos consistently the fastest guy out there
5857057 if those three can get into the final i like our chances
5857058 its going to be action packed from start to finish
5857059 were going to be reaching speeds of up to 40 mph jumping big jumps 30 feet long and of course there are going to be crashes
5857060 a couple older guys gave it to me saying i was smooth like butter on my bike i think its a good nickname its stuck with me
5857061 from a visual perspective he just looks like hes effortless when he rides
5857062 to me 90 of the race is won from the start in the blink of an eye you mess up you get a bad start you get cut off out the gate its not necessarily over but your chances are slim to catch back up
5857063 every time i get up on that starting hill im scared its a risk youre going to take if you love your sport as much as i do youre willing to take that
5857064 if we can shave a half second off his time at the start hes going to be really hard to beat
5857065 there are a lot of guys that ride the track really good or ride certain spots of the track good but kyle can do everything
5857066 everyone has one niche but hes got all the niches
5857067 neighbors would be standing out there thinking whats this guy doing a grown man out there riding his bicycle
5857068 but after i won the world championships it came out in the paper the neighbors came out and said thats awesome youre going to be in the olympics im getting some respect from them now im not just some punk kid out there riding my bike
5857069 were doing a lot of squatting a lot of powerlifting style movements
5857070 hes so laid back goes with the flow doesnt stress too much on anything
5857071 one time my wife told me she was leaving me so i packed my bag
5857072 i want to build a bmx training facility and work with kids
5857073 thats what i plan on doing in a couple years its all i know its what ive done since i was 7 years old
5857074 theres a great chance of winning the title player of the year as in leading the european order of merit
5857075 after that they are all good tournaments and you want to win those and obviously i would have one eye on the world rankings so that would be a definite motivation in it
5857076 despite the success of our partnership we understand that priorities change and wish chevron the best in implementing its new marketing initiatives
5857077 the idea of a goddess of destruction is one that ive cherished for a long time cedric victor bassist and visual collaborator mentioned kali when we were recording because of the thematic similarities to the songs i had already written
5857078 as we progressed everything seemed to come together around this theme of respect reverence for strength and simultaneous repulsion fear of power kalis narrative also discusses nietzsches old adage that in fighting the monster one must be careful that one does not become the monster which seems to be a relevant message
5857079 gt pedro pos la verdad en particular me late un buen y este nuevo dis
5857080 gt andrew hernandez iind realize that our album is out gojira just announced the tit
5857081 he balled staring aggressively at the crew member nearest the door
5857082 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
5857083 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5857084 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5857085 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
5857086 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited at this news and went looking for film producer albert r cubby broccoli to tell him
5857087 do you know how much of a percentage hed want
5857088 its always been policy that no bond director ever got a slice of the box office profits
5857089 so spielberg went off and made indiana jones who i reckon to be a period james bond
5857090 this is where i tried to extinguish it but it wasnt going to happen so it just kept on going knocked out all the wires just a big pile of smoke
5857091 and this is what im going to kill you with
5857092 if you guys got a hold of that tape youd be crying really hard
5857093 newman repeatedly made it clear that he wanted to be buried next to his life long partner ambrose st john no one gave the pope permission to defy newmans wishes the re burial has only one aim in mind to cover up newmans homosexuality and to disavow his love for another man it is an act of shameless dishonesty and personal betrayal by the gay hating catholic church
5857094 now cardinal newmans great friendship with ambrose st john is being slyly suggested as evidence of his being subject to a disordered sexuality the utter absurdity of this idea speaks for itself
5857095 of all the people ive had the privilege to break bread with the person i most enjoy is still hillary
5857096 trust me on this one if you re the lucky winner it will be a night youll really enjoy and one to remember read the full e mail at wonkette
5857097 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
5857098 undoubtedly this is a symptom of the global credit crunch
5857099 record losses from the subprime fallout and rising delinquencies have squeezed issuers credit so tight theyre tapping out add that to the fact that consumers credit is already stretched and youre left with a tough market for credit card issuers
5857100 there is still a lot of work to do before this city is fully recovered
5857101 and for people who are still hurting and not yet back in their homes a brighter day might seem impossible yet a brighter day is coming and it is heralded by hopeful signs of progress
5857102 its defined him a great deal in the publics mind
5857103 first impressions have ways of becoming lasting ones and certainly that was the case with katrina
5857104 its not the quantity of the visits its the quality of the visits
5857105 more like a supercharged comptrollers office than a supercharged recovery office
5857106 if its left abandoned certainly that isnt helpful to the redevelopment of either of those heavily damaged neighborhoods that surround it
5857107 theres nothing on our risk list that i would term a showstopper or major issue that we cant deal with
5857108 practitioners can now go beyond therapy on the basis of ethnicity into the precisely targeted arena of personal genomics
5857109 one great thing about hockey is that youre able to display aggressive behavior in an acceptable manner you dont have to go to prison or whatnot for striking someone with an elbow it makes a good setting to look at aggression
5857110 we were astounded to see that this relatively simple measurement in the face predicted how aggressive men were in a lab based computer game and then equally astounded to see that the same measure could predict aggressive behavior in a real world setting that of sports
5857111 competitors may have used this cue likely on a subconscious level to decide whether or not to take an opponent on
5857112 for example if people were asked to rate how aggressive men were was on the basis of photographs would their ratings be accurate
5857113 these are the types of follow up research questions that we are now investigating
5857114 perhaps what the authors have documented is not an effect of masculine facial qualities and effects of testosterone but rather behavioral compensation for the social effects of babyfaceness
5857115 surprisingly i have found that their behavior is opposite to these expectations something that could be attributed to a self defeating prophecy effect whereby babyfaced men overcompensate for social expectations that are unpleasant for young men
5857116 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5857117 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5857118 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5857119 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5857120 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that
5857121 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5857122 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5857123 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5857124 once again our committee has done an amazing job putting together a stellar group of student athletes that have shown their leadership on the court in the classroom and in the community
5857125 each one represents all that this award is about and i look forward to april when we will name another talented woman to this prestigious list
5857126 it is an honor to be included among such an outstanding group of players
5857127 i look up and down the list and see nothing but talented players and it is exciting to be recognized with them
5857128 he donnan probably asked me about jobs his first year here
5857129 this involvement preceded the tenure of the current head football coach
5857130 when donnan made this request the only difference is you are trading white kids for black kids
5857131 jim donnan and bobby pruett are first class human beings and essentially have done an awful lot of things to help youngsters
5857132 given the fragility of african agriculture and perpetual famine risks with millions of lives at stake msv is actually one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide
5857133 we wanted to learn more about how the virus emerged and spread so we can develop new ways to fight the diseases it causes
5857134 we found that the maize adapted virus infects a greater variety of grasses than any of the other msv strains
5857135 the virus appears to be spreading around africa faster than the other strains too when we compared the genomes of 11 different strains of msv we discovered that lots of genes had been exchanged between the strains in a process called recombination we also found that every msv that causes severe disease in maize has descended from an ancestral virus that was the recombinant offspring of two relatively harmless wild grass infecting viruses this chance recombination event could be the reason msv has become such a serious problem
5857136 understanding the chain of events that trigger the emergence of novel pathogens is a major goal of epidemiologists worldwide
5857137 there is a lot of circumstantial evidence suggesting how evolutionary processes like recombination might trigger the emergence of a pathogen but there are actually very few well documented examples of this having occurred
5857138 knowing that maize adapted msvs are unusually mobile i hope will prompt scientists to test msv resistance genes against the large bank of virus strains that we have catalogued from across africa
5857139 thousands of cases of west nile virus have been reported worldwide but 80 of infected people dont show any symptoms
5857140 it is important to have highly sensitive and specific tests to diagnose infections and also to help track the ecology and epidemiology of west nile encephalitis
5857141 although the methods developed are for diagnosing west nile virus in horses the procedures can be easily modified to develop new antibody tests for humans and wildlife
5857142 it is essential to test wildlife for infection to determine the ecological and epidemiological aspects of west nile virus infections in nature so that we can try to control the disease by managing mosquito populations
5857143 the ou initiative is the only major u s initiative of its kind devoted to the problem of biodeterioration and biocorrosion
5857144 first we have to understand how mother nature cleans up these spills and we can do this by studying the way microorganisms interact with hydrocarbons
5857145 we want to better understand how organisms eat through these pipelines several fundamental mechanisms cause this problem but it is spotty and doesnt occur all of a sudden rather biocorrosion occurs over a long period of time and we are using a series of new molecular and chemical tools to find out why and how this happens
5857146 we think cells grow in communities that adhere to the inner surface of pipelines and form three dimensional biofilms that can sometimes cause pitting once we understand what these microorganisms are doing we can interrupt their processes or diagnose them more effectively the science is rudimentary at this stage the modern tools of molecular microbiology have not been applied yet but a national science foundation grant support from the does joint genome institute and the cooperation of the energy industry allowed us to study pipeline biocorrosion on the north slope
5857147 for many years no one ever thought anaerobes could grow by metabolizing hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen but that is simply wrong the organisms are actually quite good at it the underlying mechanisms will be even more important as we introduce newer biofuels to augment our fossil fuel supply we are putting new fuel combinations into the existing pipelines that service the entire country the new biofuels can be less stable so there is a different problem to deal with the chemistry of biofuels may not allow us to store them as long and more research is needed to determine the stability compatability and composition of such fuel mixtures
5857148 because two thirds of u s oil is still in place we can use these organisms to convert residual hydrocarbons into natural gas and create a new source of domestic energy the concept of anaerobic metabolism is an innovative process and the ou initiative is the only one of its kind in the united states at the present time we are also experimenting with shales and other unconventional reservoirs
5857149 biotechnology can influence recovery and address some of todays problems if we can understand how microorganisms degrade hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen ou is one of the top universities in the world to study anaerobic microbiology with 14 experts performing research in some aspect of this field it is rare for universities to have even a single individual with this specialization ou is an exciting place to be if you are an environmental microbiologist this initiative has unified this group of experts and led to the groundbreaking research we have just begun to understand
5857150 if by elitist bastard you mean someone who isnt embarrassed to enjoy learning new things if by elitist bastard you mean someone who takes pride in making reasonable and logical decisions if by elitist bastard you mean someone who seeks to use their skills to make the world a better place then yes i suppose i am an elitist bastard
5857151 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
5857152 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
5857153 the big picture is we keep learning more about the contributions of environmental toxins to the chronic diseases of aging for which we never suspected an environmental cause
5857154 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
5857155 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
5857156 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
5857157 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
5857158 initial tests have shown that network load could be reduced by a factor of five or more without compromising network performance
5857159 at the same time speeds are increased by about 20 percent
5857160 we think we have one of the most extensible rigorous architectures for making these applications run more efficiently
5857161 the project seems to have a momentum of its own
5857162 we realized that p2p networks were not taking advantage of the flexibility that exists
5857163 instead of needing relaxation measurements that require using neutron scattering a national facility with limited time availability we have developed a widely accessible solution in the form of readily available steady state fluorescence measurements
5857164 this will allow pharmaceutical companies to adopt the new metrology weve developed
5857165 typically when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy individuals to determine cognitive impairment
5857166 however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5857167 we know that level of performance on tests of memory attention and executive function predicts dementia however this study showed for the first time that the degree of variability in performance across neuropsychological tests measured within a person improved the prediction of dementia above and beyond ones level of performance on each test alone
5857168 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period which on average was 3 3 years
5857169 this figure is in line with what wed expect for the incidence of dementia in this population
5857170 without any connecting knowledge i started to itch the one sore
5857171 it then leached over to my other hand after i itched the sore then in went to my finger unfortunately then it went to my eyelid
5857172 its a problem just because the amount of traffic that flows through the intersection on a daily basis
5857173 traffic will get backed up there and therell be a lot of close calls near misses
5857174 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oil is filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions
5857175 because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
5857176 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
5857177 we were in all weekend working we were working until 2 a m working 10 12 hour days just trying to get this resolved
5857178 at some point youre probably going to get attacked and you have to think of what are the best measures best practices to make sure that you get that site and the services that are being attacked down and get them back up as quickly as possible
5857179 theyre basically looking for a hole in your fence to get inside youre perimeter and once inside they pretty much have access to a lot of things
5857180 people should feel safe on our site and when youre visiting our services
5857181 it would be convenient to say that its a whole lot of other people who need to be part of the equation
5857182 but we have the job and we have to do something
5857183 if we want to really get kids to the level that we want to get them
5857184 and we want to do it in a more efficient and effective way then we would be well served if we took care of those kinds of problems if we provided more resources to kids from conception to early childhood if we took care of mental health issues and physical ailments and teeth and eye examinations including you know where these kids go home to sleep at night ive lived in this community a long time and i cant imagine how i could ever feel comfortable in neighborhoods that these kids live in at night and yet they do and we still expect them to do well
5857185 so now can i solve all those problems tomorrow afternoon can i even get the attention of the people who have control over those things right now in new orleans after katrina the answer is no i cant but i cant take the position that i cant succeed unless i have those things i have to take the position that were going to do it in spite of that now will it be hard will i be less successful probably yes but i have to take that approach because i dont have really any other cards to play
5857186 the new challenge we have is that for approximately five years the plan which is a very bad plan but is the only plan that nasa and the administration and congress have approved is to be dependent on the russian soyuz vehicle to get people to and from the international space station
5857187 and so now with the political realities with russia invading georgia we have a new wrinkle thrown in
5857188 russia must realize that its actions in georgia will not be ignored by the international community we stand by georgia our friend and ally and call on the ioc to designate a new venue for the russian olympics
5857189 realized that a deed of gift had not been finalized
5857190 not sure what circumstances were and why the deed was not provided
5857191 similar to efforts by regimes like those in nicaragua under the sandinistas and venezuela under chavez to impose control over teachers and their independent unions by an authoritarian regime
5857192 these students have been learning about their country for the last three months since school let out keeping notebooks etc today they came out and participated in all of the activities and thats how they got their awards
5857193 i dont care how many movies are available to me
5857194 massage is helpful in the short term but the alexander technique retained effectiveness at one year the results should apply to most patients with chronic or recurrent back pain
5857195 helping people succeed using honest ethical affordable tools systems and team building strategies
5857196 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5857197 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5857198 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5857199 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5857200 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5857201 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5857202 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5857203 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5857204 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5857205 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5857206 veo nubarrones pero no tormentas pese a que en estados unidos hay huracanes
5857207 pues nuestro principal socio comercial y alno tener crecimiento vendemos menos sin embargo no tenemos choque econ mico que nos permita deducir que el pa s caer en crisis
5857208 estamos tranquilos sin estar contentos m xico hoy cuenta con finanzas p blicas sanas mercados diversificados y reservas internacionales altas lo que permite afrontar una posible crisis econ mica
5857209 no es una decisi n para afectar a alguien por el contrario me parece bien que no se haya quitado de golpe el subsidio pero tambi n se deben revisar los excedentes petroleros los ingresos tributarios y las tarifas el ctricas
5857210 reiteramos el llamado al gobierno del distrito federal para que en coordinaci n con la ciudadan a hagamos campa a para incentivar el uso del transporte escolar pero no de forma obligatoria a todos nos interesa una ciudad m s gil en el tr fico vehicular y menos contaminada
5857211 los tabasque os son sus consentidos pues todos le caen muy bien pero aclaro que algunos no porque hay de todo pero en general me caen muy bien
5857212 estamos haciendo muchas obras y entregando muchos apoyos porque estamos comprometidos con el pan
5857213 quarterly unit sales of handsets fell to their lowest level since npd begin tracking the category in 2005
5857214 even so most major manufacturers picked up market share that was lost by motorola
5857215 we will complete animation on coraline in about six weeks and plan a february release of 2009
5857216 it concerns itself with a primal thought every child considers i wish i had other parents that and the button eyes
5857217 the movie version of coraline is very faithful to the tone and the spirit of the book
5857218 in the translation from book to film there are adjustments to story and character that have to be made the main thing i always felt was i could not disappoint the readers of the book and though some details have been changed as well as the order of the sequences i feel we will be successful
5857219 there is no doubt that there are some similarities between the two projects
5857220 i also have many of the original nightmare team members working on coraline weve all grown and the visual aesthetic is ultimately a very different one youll see great animation like nightmare like a cousin of nightmare more like a second cousin the last thing id want to do would be to try to rip off a classic film i directed
5857221 it just gives you more of what is there just a little more sense of the reality of this medium

5857226 the trcc is not serving the needs of homeowners and the legislature needs to go back to the drawing board and start over again
5857227 were seeing an uptick now but we dont consider this to be more than upward pressure from low prices in the past
5857228 it is unfortunate that state farm and allstate are choosing to raise rates on drivers at a time when texans are struggling to keep up with rising costs of gasoline food and housing
5857229 we understand the plants were due for harvest at the end of the year and ready for sale on the streets over the christmas and new year period
5857230 the group left keyasi at 4am and arrived at the farms at mid day they uprooted the 6973 marijuana plants and returned to the main road at 5 30pm
5857231 by the time police arrive there is no one there these farmers are now using modern technology like mobile phones and binoculars so when their friends in the villagers see a new police vehicle in the area they call the people in the mountains and warn them
5857232 recent raids weve conducted have shown that the problem of marijuana cultivation is not under control as we had thought
5857233 we have noted that the draft charter was born out of a treasonous act lacks credibility is totally illegitimate and that members of the national council for building fiji ncbbf have no democratic mandate whatsoever to determine how the people of fiji should conduct themselves
5857234 most seriously the draft charter seeks to legislate new electoral reforms and abolish the 46 communal seats of the fijian indian and general elector communities effectively disenfranchise the people particularly the indo fijian and minority communities
5857235 id rather vote for the devil i know than the devil i dont know
5857236 especially if this ruling is appealed us v boucher could become a landmark case the question of whether a criminal defendant can be legally compelled to cough up his encryption passphrase remains an unsettled one with law review articles for the last decade arguing the merits of either approach
5857237 thousands of images of adult pornography and animation depicting adult and child pornography

5857254 how can they retain the skills of leadership that got them there in the first place
5857255 new jersey wants to end discrimination in marriage and is ready for our public officials to do it right now the civil union law is one the greatest civil rights failures of our time new jersey sees that and understands that justice delayed is justice denied
5857256 how in the end does killing its citizens help the state to build the nonviolent just and civil society that we all desire for ourselves and our children
5857257 we are not going to kill our way out of a culture that is awash in violence
5857258 justice is an issue of doing the right thing regardless of the cost
5857259 to be meaningful justice should be swift and sure life without parole which begins immediately is both of these the death penalty is neither
5857260 capital punishment drags victims loved ones through an agonizing and lengthy process holding out the promise of one punishment in the beginning and often resulting in a life sentence in the end anyway
5857261 though we share different perspectives on the death penalty every one of us agrees that marylands capital punishment system doesnt work for victims families and that our state is better off without it
5857262 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5857263 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5857264 that would be pure speculation i think that would be easy to fall back on and point fingers id prefer to take the high road and stay away from that
5857265 its something that happens over a long period of time its a wear and tear situation and then finally it reaches a point where youve got to fix it
5857266 to be honest with you i did not particularly see this coming but im not totally shot out of the water by it i understand the background and how many innings hes pitched
5857267 i dont think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out what a central figure hes been on our ballclub
5857268 versucht von jabba the hutt fernzubleiben da ich ihn f r die realserie nutzen m chte
5857269 but due to their disliking of the final result they will remix and remaster the effort
5857270 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
5857271 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that
5857272 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
5857273 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that
5857274 i think that russia is looking for a reason to have a serious conflict with ukraine
5857275 he brought a gun to a fistfight and used it
5857276 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5857277 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life

5857282 to not be overly clogging my head with baseball scenarios
5857283 im obviously excited to get out of the house and back on the field
5857284 i was only home for five or six days i was able to keep throwing and due diligence to stay ready
5857285 hes deemed entirely healthy hes built up as much as he needs to be to pitch long out of the pen hes ready to go today well utilize him from the sixth inning on
5857286 we dont know exactly what were going to do yet for saturday well see how it goes through this series then well make a decision probably at the last minute
5857287 keep the ball down change speeds and get ahead in the count thats about it
5857288 im in limbo ill just test it every day by playing catch and take the next step from there
5857289 to not be overly clogging my head with baseball scenarios
5857290 im obviously excited to get out of the house and back on the field
5857291 i was only home for five or six days i was able to keep throwing and due diligence to stay ready

5857294 keep the ball down change speeds and get ahead in the count thats about it
5857295 im in limbo ill just test it every day by playing catch and take the next step from there
5857296 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5857297 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5857298 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5857299 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5857300 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5857301 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5857302 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5857303 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5857304 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment

5857307 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5857308 theres a paw on my saw and an eye on my drill and her little tail is wrapped around my pliers

5857310 over the last twenty years the name mike vallely has come to be associated with an ever expanding p

5857312 god please lead me to 50 gs of cold hard cash amen
5857313 i think i set an olympic record for big men
5857314 jeff guess what i saw on the news last night
5857315 i dont think its fair for people to look at it and say all of a sudden that he is going to be the next steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
5857316 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted to this league
5857317 i think he has done a great job but i have been here a while so ive seen when rookies come in and catch a couple balls and everyone gets excited
5857318 i thought he caught the ball ok he had a couple of drops in there
5857319 we hebben al zo weinig wedstrijden dat we moeten profiteren van de drie vier dagen dat we samen zijn voor zon match
5857320 door de olympische spelen ziet de groep er noodgedwongen ook wat anders uit maar ook dat kan het interessant maken
5857321 dit is een interessante wedstrijd met heel veel interessante dingen met het oog op de wk kwalificatieronde
5857322 voor spelers die er een tijd niet meer bij geweest zijn is dit een gelegenheid om zich weer in de kijker te spelen
5857323 hetzelfde geldt voor de enkele extra ervaren spelers die erbij zijn
5857324 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5857325 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5857326 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5857327 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5857328 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5857329 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5857330 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5857331 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5857332 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5857333 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5857334 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5857335 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5857336 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5857337 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5857338 russia is very clearly isolating itself its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5857339 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5857340 does anybody really doubt that russia could use its overwhelming military advantage to beat up on a small neighbor well thats what theyve done
5857341 we need to start drilling offshore on advanced oil rigs like this one
5857342 new drilling has got to be part of our energy solution
5857343 for generations people have lightened their environmental impact by multiplying their consumption less than their income
5857344 we have found encouraging evidence that this trend continues particularly in places like china and india
5857345 though positive evidence prevails our analysis reports troubling directions for brazil and especially indonesia
5857346 the importance of this sector looks set to carry on growing it currently contributes 25 per cent of the countrys gross domestic product but as oil reserves dwindle the hope is that it will carry on along the upward trajectory that saw assets rising 34 per cent in 2006
5857347 indeed the central bank is facing up to the competition by improving market conditions through adjustments to its rules and regulations establishing for example a code of best practice on consumer credit and charging
5857348 looking to the future bahrains banking sector looks set to continue in rude health through continued strong leadership unique access to the sizeable saudi arabian market a talented labour pool 72 per cent of which is composed of bahraini nationals and a liberal social environment
5857349 we have already completed all the paperwork and we hope to be in the market sometime in sep tember
5857350 this is the first time we will be going to the market with a rupee denominated local sukuk
5857351 it is as if governments do not want to see the islamic banking industry over dominated by the private sector in order to keep the whole thing under control
5857352 if governments have an increasing share of ownership in ifis the risk of consumers perceiving an ifi as insufficiently compliant with sharia is somewhat mitigated
5857353 many new ifis have clearly made their ambitions public with very large capital bases right from inception their vocation is immediately international
5857354 we have seen a mushrooming of new islamic financial institutions ifis and there are several reasons for this
5857355 the consolidation is not on the agenda of islamic financiers at this stage microenomomic theory says that a growing and profitable market provides enough space for a sizeable number of newcomers
5857356 the uaes financial services sector is the one of the fastest growing sectors in our economy this is a tremendous opportunity for our group and we are confident that this strategic step will enhance growth and value creation in the industry and solidify dubais position as a leading global financial centre
5857357 the market for shariah compliant investments and financial services continues to grow very rapidly dubai banking group will be one of the clear leaders in this market and will continue to aggressively target significant direct investments and acquisitions in a wide range of sectors across the worlds biggest islamic markets including the gcc south east asia and africa
5857358 were very excited to launch this revolutionary product at alburaq we have a tradition of pioneering developments in the uk islamic mortgage market were now breaking new ground in the savings market by launching the uks first halaal alternative to a guaranteed equity bond
5857359 our research has shown that whilst the muslim community highly values property as a means of wealth generation there is also a desire for alternative investment options our unique savings plan was created in response to that need
5857360 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
5857361 het gaat over schoonheid met daarbij bizarre personages en een grote witte boot
5857362 i got a chance to run around a little bit in practice yesterday throw the ball around it felt good limited stuff but i hope to be able to be able to work more and more in as the week goes on
5857363 weve had a lot of needs that have gone unmet
5857364 we dont have a capital bill we dont have our bills paid off yet we have a problem with our pension system theres been personality conflicts down here which i think i can overcome
5857365 ive worked very hard with the house speaker ive worked very hard with the governor
5857366 and i would go in with an open mind hoping that wed come together on that issue and compromise to address the infrastructure needs for the state of illinois
5857367 if enough students make that point perhaps the politicians will listen a lot of dollars are misguided
5857368 parents are calling to make sure school will start on time
5857369 i just think its more of an excuse now to just hang out in the streets and not do anything
5857370 its good that we encourage the positive things in each other
5857371 i think people will think what they want to think
5857372 i think we need to put ourselves in the position of acting according to the highest ethical principles i believe our people do that now and i believe our people will be doing that in the future as well
5857373 this is all part of the medical arms race for research talent among universities
5857374 im going on vacation for about two weeks do you have something i can use to feed my fish while im gone
5857375 one of these tablets in the tank will dissolve slowly so that your fish can eat from it while youre gone itll last about a week
5857376 so then since im going to be gone for two weeks would it work if i just put two of them in the tank
5857377 small cap stocks have higher expected returns than large company stocks but also carry more risk
5857378 will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
5857379 he always would just let me know that he loved me and he was never embarrassed to say that and he was pretty special
5857380 davids absolute best friend is his brother matt and no one will ever know how much matt has meant to him
5857381 well you know i come across a lot of potholes
5857382 i had to have a front end put on my car so its rough
5857383 ive had with my car ive had some wheels that were bent and damaged
5857384 i actually avoid the drive i dont take it whenever i can i only go down it for scenic drives
5857385 a fetus develops a heartbeat only around the 16th week so at 23 weeks it is still very slow five minutes or more can pass before such a premature babys heart beats or it takes a breath after 20 minutes without such a sign of life doctors let nature take its course and the baby is presumed dead and taken to the morgue but she didnt die in the morgue and then didnt spontaneously come back to life
5857386 this is nonsense there was no miracle putting a live miscarried fetus in the cooler slows down the metabolism so it remains in suspended animation in fact there is now a new treatment for viable premature babies to put them in a cooler to perpetuate this suspended animation and protect the brain from damage

5857392 ive heard that line from oc driver before but if you look at a map the 241 and the 261
5857393 chico has similar bicycle parking on its main streets i found it quite nice to see and well
5857394 when youre caught up in the euphoria of growth sometimes standards slide
5857395 whenever you have a fast growing industry segment they need to make sure that their human capital and the infrastructure are sufficient to ensure that the activities are conducted prudently
5857396 it has the potential to grow because of the high demand and the interest to make the uk the international heart of islamic finance business
5857397 asia is in our loop but we are now focusing on european and gcc markets
5857398 how to close guantanamo a blueprint for the next administration
5857399 i dont think she can do it without our support i dont want to be in front of the school board every year to fight over the scraps
5857400 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
5857401 do not represent a majority of our shareholders and they are the only investors we have heard from on this matter
5857402 over the past 15 years the companys annualized total shareholder return was 15 2 percent and last tuesday plum creeks stock hit an all time high of 50 per share this performance is quite contrary to the dow jones being down more than 13 percent this year and the s amp p 500 being down more than 12 percent
5857403 will do it better more creatively more responsibly and provide real value to the communities in the state that we serve
5857404 we believe in the value of the dress code and believe that its part of the national standard
5857405 i think its not fair to say what people can wear because its just either their fashion statement or their personality you know
5857406 it just depends on who they are and you cant really tell somebody what they can and cant wear
5857407 weve got diversity planning in place weve got sensitivity training in place with local corporations that will do that weve got customer service training in place and were also talking to get some tourism training in place so that we can promote the better and the broader aspect of kansas city as a whole
5857408 this is product extension at its best where the new products ipod and iphone are helping bring new customers to existing computer products
5857409 the fact that apple is not dependent on the windows vista operating system hasnt hurt either
5857410 youre ignoring japan youre ignoring korea the statement that somehow the web has not been mobile until the iphone is absurd and back to the point about parochialism
5857411 i believe that nokia and symbian the software that powers its smart phones are irrelevant companies at this point
5857412 everyone is looking for a more of an iphone blackberry like solution
5857413 you can trick yourself into believing the iphone is not such a big deal if you say there are only 7 million in the world
5857414 but you would be completely wrong because youve got to take into account the engagement levels
5857415 symbian is not dead but it has a limited amount of time to act to capture developer mind share before it is too late
5857416 i feel powerless i feel like a subject awaiting what the good king will bestow upon us this time the result could be pleasing boring useful useless it doesnt matter really because it has nothing to do with me i am a minion
5857417 weve been trained to believe that gadgets come from big companies which is a fallacy
5857418 were not even in the same ballpark were filling that vast middle ground between iphone and electrical engineering

5857426 eso toca dejarlo muy claro ten amos una preocupaci n la semana pasada y conversamos con los congresistas ponentes de un importante proyecto que es el de ciencia y tecnolog a
5857427 sin embargo personas interesadas en que el pa s tenga des rdenes que estas instituciones no funcionen se han dedicado a manipular a muchachos ingenuos e incentivarlos a estas actividades
5857428 este a o ejecutamos un presupuesto de un bill n 344 mil millones de pesos completito solo hay un aplazamiento de una plata pero eso tiene que ver con un ajuste fiscal que no tiene nada que ver con el motivo de la protesta
5857429 el sena gracias a la voluntad del gobierno a la pol tica decidida del gobierno uribe ha crecido de forma impresionante en el 2002 solamente lleg bamos con cupos a un mill n de estudiantes este a o superamos los 5 5 millones de personas y eso tiene que ver con la capacidad de haber ejecutado todo nuestro presupuesto
5857430 tom is one of the most respected coaches in the united states he has a lot of experience and has had success at several institutions he brings an unquestioned work ethic integrity and pride to his job we are very much looking forward to toms contributions and seeing his mark on our pitching staff here at san jose state he is a great addition
5857431 i am very excited and thankful for the opportunity to return to my alma mater san jose state university and honored to be a representative of this university and the spartan baseball family once again
5857432 i have always had tremendous respect for coach piraro and his work ethic baseball knowledge and his ability to successfully balance family home work and baseball being named the 2008 co coach of the year in the western athletic conference i think is a testimony and reward for the impressive job coach piraro and his staff did in getting the most out of their players this past season i hope to build upon that momentum as i join the program and as we enter this fall season it was especially gratifying and memorable to congratulate coach piraro and the spartan baseball team in the dugout at rosenblatt stadium after a morning workout at the 2000 college world series in omaha while there with stanford i hope and expect that we can challenge for similar results in the future
5857433 jeff served us very well in 2008 and with one year of added experience under his belt i anticipate that jeff will do an outstanding job this year he will continue to serve as our recruiting coordinator and work with our hitters
5857434 im very happy to stay on at san jose state
5857435 working with coach piraro last year was great for me personally as a coach and as an educator and i have really enjoyed working with this group of players as well im looking forward to continuing the things that we started and helping to take san jose state to the next level
5857436 as far as recruiting goes we are going to keep moving forward
5857437 we have a good recruiting plan im going to do my best to find quality baseball players good students and good members of both the san jose state and bay area community
5857438 fundamental frames or lenses that we use to orient ourselves to the world around us they work largely below awareness or in our subconscious minds and shape and reshape just about everything we think feel hear say and do they are almost a secret or hidden language of thought and action
5857439 is this the bit where she gets raped and murdered

5857470 we need the help of isps they have the technical ability to manage the flow over their pipes the good news is that were beginning to see some of these solutions emerge in particular in europe and asia

5857496 the outraged women of mount isa felt that the mayors comments were archaic and it is totally not the image that we want to project for our city

5857498 they will have to do more than call for my resignation
5857499 i wont be resigning because im quite comfortable with what i said
5857500 mount isa my city has taken the olympic games off the front page of papers all over australia and the world and ive never heard of that happening before
5857501 people have supported me everywhere and at the moment i feel like im sitting on the top of mount kosciusko
5857502 i thought it was very degrading for the city and for someone in public office he shouldnt be speaking in such terms
5857503 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa

5857506 he has had dramas in relation to bullying he suffered bullying at the start of the year when he was doing his first course and his family dealt with that nothing had materialised in this particular course but it may be that he kept a lid on it
5857507 its been an ongoing thing and its obviously eaten away at him and come to a head on saturday
5857508 there were no outward signs that he was feeling depressed the indication from the family was that he was feeling good and his behaviour was normal
5857509 i think what cases like this highlight is the sustained impact that bullying can have it can impact on peoples relationships their confidence and how they interact with others
5857510 even when bullying might itself come to an end it can have that sustained impact and thats why we need to stop bullying and get that message out and in this case change the way people see those with a disability
5857511 i think it highlights that despite the changes in community attitudes towards people with a disability we still have a lot of work to do

5857516 the students have already voluntarily provided a 30 page security analysis to the mbta and have offered to meet with the mbta and walk the transit agency through the security vulnerability and the students suggestions for improvement
5857517 the only thing keeping the students and the mbta from working together cooperatively to resolve the fare payment card security issues is the lawsuit itself
5857518 the mbta would be far better off focusing on improving the mbtas fare payment security instead of pursuing needless litigation

5857520 senator mccain describes himself as a straight talker and a critic of the washington lobbying establishment

5857576 what women can do is start putting themselves up for promotions and making it quite clear that they actually want to be promoted ms broderick told the nine network
5857577 when we women come back into the workplace we are now a person with a visible caring responsibility and thats what actually is impeding on us in our progress to more senior roles

5857580 the adoption of icd 10 is long overdue and the replacement to icd 9 clinical modification has been discussed over the past 10 years
5857581 has the potential to be the most complex change for the u s health care system in decades
5857582 as we have seen with the protracted implementation of other requirements of the health insurance portability and accountability act such massive system and workflow changes necessitate coordinated actions among medical groups and their vendors clearinghouses and health plans
5857583 cms should have instituted pilot testing in a broad array of clinical settings before publishing the rule to fully ascertain the impact of icd 10 on the health care system it is a recipe for disaster to force such a change without pilot testing and allowing sufficient time for implementation

5857587 it is unacceptable that children have the odds stacked against them simply by default of having poorer parents the government must put its money where its mouth is and end child poverty so that all children no matter their background have equal chances to achieve a decent education
5857588 there has been an enormous programme of social reform over the past 10 years that has lifted 600 000 children out of poverty we are committed to accelerating this and to do this we are narrowing the gap in educational achievement between children from deprived backgrounds and those who are better off
5857589 eleven years after labour came to power almost two million children have left school without any good gcse passes

5857591 and standards are also rising in higher attaining schools the number of secondary schools where 70 or more pupils gain five good gcses has risen eleven fold to 891 up from 83 in 1997 we are now putting 400 million of extra money into schools with the lowest gcse results
5857592 there has been an impressive increase in recycling of domestic waste in the last few years but that only represents a tiny fraction of all waste generated in the uk
5857593 we would also like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
5857594 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway culture we currently have
5857595 i think there was a real feeling in the nato meeting that russia has failed to live up to its commitments and that has serious consequences for the trust that is placed in russia as an international partner

5857598 nobody in the general public actually cares about john edwards or his unsavory behavior edwards became ancient history the first five minutes after this thing broke
5857599 theyre all still hiding but theyre hiding in plain sight we can see them dont they know we can all see them hiding
5857600 trapped like a rat john edwards spoke those soothing words to his mistress rielle hunter after admitting to their illicit affair
5857601 of course i still love you dont worry well get through this
5857602 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did

5857615 i think people get the idea of being a leader a little messed up
5857616 a leader just doesnt come in and start saying things and breaking chalkboards and throwing bottles around the locker room it starts with your play im not a big rah rah guy thats high school stuff the pregame talks and win one for the gipper id rather go out there and play hard and show them the way to do it there comes a time where you have to stand up and grab someone by the face mask and get things going and that just comes naturally i think when you talk too much you lose credibility when you do the right thing your words carry a lot more weight
5857617 when you know what youre doing and youre confident in what youre doing and you prepare yourself you can be relaxed and kind of kick butt when you have to we cant walk around the street sacking people in the grocery store and being jerks youve got to be personable but on sundays we can turn it on and get it done

5857640 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
5857641 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
5857642 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll

5857660 from our point of view weve got to look at where our growers are going to get their water from
5857661 there are massive challenges with water in places like murcia southern spain we have to look at least 10 years ahead in terms of security of supply murcia will have to look very different in five years time
5857662 well have to look at new desalination technologies and we may have to look at crops that can cope with more saline conditions such as broccoli we take tomatoes out of morocco in winter and weve looked very hard at moroccan water but its complex if you use more greenhouse production here it uses more energy peas and beans are a steady all year market weve got to think about how we get them here in a responsible manner
5857663 its good news yesterday we believed there were 11 people unaccounted for we are confident that those 11 people have been located identified and are safe coconino county sheriffs department spokesman gerry blair said
5857664 it is possible of course that some people did not check in so with that possibility in mind we are continuing to search the creek from the air mr blair said
5857665 so far we havent found anyone who appears to be stranded
5857666 by the end of the session commodities have given up about half their gains whereas the euro and aussie are still trading close to their highs
5857667 were still bullish on the us dollar but having gone up so rapidly and so much in advance of what interest rate differentials are doing there comes a point where market dynamics suggest that there could be some vulnerability
5857668 the story that we have is ongoing pressure on global economies ongoing pressure on commodities and ongoing pressure on commodity currencies
5857669 it doesnt add up to a very positive aussie dollar picture
5857670 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5857671 is reflected in a democratic party platform that unequivocally defends the right to legal abortion but also calls for better access to contraception and comprehensive sex education
5857672 the clear answer beats the clever one any time unless you worry about the chaos that clarity can bring
5857673 that may be why investors like peltz ridded themselves of the stock which has fallen more than 55 since its all time peak in october 2006
5857674 we cant win the mps seat so theres no point wasting money or effort on it

5857684 everywhere i go people tell me oh im getting nervous
5857685 we wanted to kind of bless the building and kind of get it going
5857686 he asked jeff saturday to pray just about our taking the field and taking the stadium i thought it was very very touching i thought our players appreciated it it was very very special thats one of the things jim wanted to do
5857687 he said he wanted to address the team and he did
5857688 im excited i think its going to be a great thing for us to get started on a new year a fresh year guys are coming back for the fans for the community i think its all around great for this city and state to bring the new stadium here and start new and bigger things and start a tradition of continuing to win like we have been
5857689 i thought they would be much further away but theyre right behind our benches
5857690 thats definitely exciting so they can experience it with us
5857691 i think the veterans who played in the rca dome can really have an appreciation knowing they were a part of this
5857692 they can tell the difference and the contrast the thing about new guys some time its like when you win a super bowl your rookie year or you come into a stadium like this as a rookie you think thats the way it normally goes in the nfl
5857693 sometimes perspective isnt always there for the younger guys but the veterans always kind of give them the perspective and let them know about the perspective of history
5857694 the roof opens up you get a little outside atmosphere the atmosphere seems like its going to be great
5857695 i think our fans are going to be very pleased
5857696 wed heard all of the good comments from people who had been down over the weekend seeing it for yourself it rang true we got a good practice in down there and well start tomorrow wednesday to get ready for buffalo
5857697 there were a lot of eyes looking at a lot of different things the video board the advertising boards the structure the locker room everything
5857698 we got accomplished everything we wanted to do today the no 1 thing was to go down to the stadium learn our way around and see it im glad we did im glad the first time wasnt on sunday because it took a while to take everything in i think our players and our staff came away with an impression that its first class all the way
5857699 dancap has failed to meet the test for an interlocutory injunction
5857700 it seems to me that dancap seeks to obtain the rights to control the sale of the theatres through this motion
5857701 it did not negotiate for this right in the term sheet
5857702 our position was validated by the judge and he seems to have accepted all of our arguments
5857703 he says that key brand has the right to sell and that we have a binding agreement to purchase
5857704 id like to spend my time in the theatres not in the courts
5857705 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
5857706 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
5857707 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
5857708 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
5857709 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
5857710 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the centre of it
5857711 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5857712 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5857713 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
5857714 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5857715 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5857716 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5857717 at the core of all of this is what it means to be a public broadcaster
5857718 and that is to provide programming for all canadians and to reflect the arts and culture scene in canada and to reflect canada back to canadians
5857719 so cbc is greatly compressing that kind of music which you could call serious music into a listening ghetto of 10 a m to 3 p m
5857720 i say ghetto just because they know anybody who looks at the numbers knows that the available audience between 10 and 3 is very small compared with mornings or evenings or the drive home or drive to work period
5857721 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5857722 inflation is way too hot and with housing way too cold we have the opposite of a goldilocks economy said joel naroff president of naroff economic advisors
5857723 goldilocks economy refers to economic conditions that are not too hot or too cold
5857724 new building codes enacted by new york city accounted for the big jump in permits and starts in june
5857725 we are so grateful to all those who donated funds and time towards the project
5857726 the amount given has been exceptional its all come together perfectly like it was meant to be we have a truly wonderful community here in young
5857727 we chose to assist this cause because we believe one of the major priorities for regional communities is having the facilities for crisis accommodation
5857728 the new accommodation centre in the heart of young is a culmination of hard work by kim bruce and a group of dedicated supporters
5857729 the funds from the local community proves that the people of young care for those in need those who are vulnerable due to situations which are not necessarily of their own making in which those vulnerable women and children need to find emergency accommodation
5857730 maybe thats what they should do have the united states women each play with one sneaker on and one sneaker off it would be a little more competitive
5857731 she is the one player keeping this team together there are so many leaders on this u s team but the reigns have been given to her from the coaching staff
5857732 the americans are going to their bread and butter and going inside
5857733 some people have said this is the second best team in the olympics
5857734 she is relentless when she goes inside she really gives up her body
5857735 staley has certainly crossed over into being a coach youre up 21 and you still find room for improvement
5857736 maybe thats what they should do have the united states women each play with one sneaker on and one sneaker off it would be a little more competitive
5857737 he has saved the biggest race of his life for the biggest stage in the world
5857738 i think it is safe to say this is a podium no one predicted
5857739 rarely does this sport follow the script that everyone predicts
5857740 frodeno believed and now the world says so do we
5857741 between the two countries and on the field pride is at stake you dont want to lose to brazil its like united states and mexico when they play theres a huge rivalry theres a bitterness you want to win you want to have the upper hand argentina wants to have the upper hand they were number one in the world for a while brazil was number two so they were the kings of south america now brazil is starting the play again theyve won their last three outings 3 0 so theres a lot of pride at stake right now
5857742 my question is why why did they wait to get scored on to bring this kind of excitement to bring this kind of soccer to the table
5857743 now all of a sudden things are clicking and thats the beauty of being a center forward when things click it doesnt matter how they go in one goes in two go in three go in now all of a sudden were starting to see the tournament aguero weve seen playing in spain for atl tico madrid
5857744 lanai is very different from maui when it comes to transient
5857745 this the first of his signs jesus did at cana in galilee and manifested his glory and his disciples believed in him
5857746 now jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book but these are written so that you may believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that by believing you may have life in his name
5857747 our pastor doesnt proclaim to us what the bible says and means the messages are not revelations of the glory of christ they are advice talks with a religious twist
5857748 but we have renounced disgraceful underhanded ways we refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with gods word but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyones conscience in the sight of god
5857749 we have little hope in our lifetime to believe for a major enough cultural political and religious change to occur in our context such that muslims would become open to entering christianity on a wide scale
5857750 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5857751 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same

5857761 in areas where there is no csa office these private appointments give parents the opportunity to discuss any issues or concerns about child support face to face with a customer service officer
5857762 the impact of separation can be overwhelming and parents will have many concerns as everyone in the family adjusts to their new circumstances but with the goodwill and cooperation of both parents many families manage the challenges very well
5857763 its important for parents to get access to the support services they need and understand all their options when it comes to child support
5857764 there will be free csa information booklets available about all aspects of separated parenting including maintaining a relationship with kids from a distance and tips and hints for people who are re partnering
5857765 with alternative fuels gas today was 3 53 a gallon where propane was under 2 00 a galon the other neat thing the government is putting their money where their mouth is and giving you a 50 cent tax credit per gallon to drive an alternative fuel

5857771 we are in the midst of a fierce correction from a period of indiscriminate behaviour in the credit markets a surfeit of homebuilding a global avalanche of cheap labour and correspondingly cheap imports and other unsustainable financial and economic activity
5857772 unless the python that is the us economy can quickly pass the recent burst of cost push pressures we risk a reinforcing spreading of inflationary impulses and expectations
5857773 should this happen and the fed were to fail to address it we would run the risk of losing the publics confidence in our ability to constrain inflation
5857774 the demand for loans is not there nor are banks willing to extend credit even if it were if this weakness becomes entrenched over the autumn it is a clear sign of very weak american output growth in 2009
5857775 schemes such as this together with cleaner coal gas and new nuclear will help us to keep the uks lights on while reducing carbon emissions and ensuring energy is as affordable as possible for our customers

5857815 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5857816 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink

5857820 the court found that the mbta massachusetts bay transportation authority was not likely to prevail on the merits of its claim under the federal computer fraud and abuse act cfaa
5857821 mbta had argued that the cfaa which prohibits the transmission of a program that causes damage to a computer also covers verbal transmission such as talking to people at conferences

5857860 so my plan of attack has been to look at what kind of journalism is happening in second life what sort of theories and understanding we already have of journalism might explain it or are people doing something radically new and different then im looking at governance in second life trying to find out what kind of values and models represent the funny mix of consumerism and citizenship which appears to characterise life in a virtual world then im looking at how these two elements of virtual life interact through a case study of the couple of events which led to the banning of unchartered banks in second life in january 2008 i dont think anyone has done any research into this area before but if im mistaken please point me in the direction of anything youve read before

5857870 democracy is not waiting to vote once every four years democracy is getting out in the streets
5857871 they the politicians are not gonna do it by themselves were gonna force their hand because that is the nature of democracy
5857872 especially now with a candidate who talks a lot about hope and change people talk about why do you need to protest
5857873 i think that we need to define what hope and change are we need to decide what that means to us as a people
5857874 for people who are disenfranchised by the system some of them for the first time are being motivated into politics
5857875 we want to create a broad progressive movement that can invite these newly politicized people in and we want to create a campaign that can take that beyond the voting booth
5857876 the story obama tells about how were gonna change this world by regular people taking action
5857877 creates more space for social movement organizing in a way we havent had since the 60s i would like to see the conventions and the protests around them take full advantage of that opportunity
5857878 use both conventions to put forward a narrative that we are starting a new chapter in american history our job is to be part of that progressive wave and to pull it to the left as much as we can
5857879 because obamas running they think weve got them theyre coming out theyre gonna support obama no matter what
5857880 some of us arent so sure that its gonna make a difference
5857881 the candidacy of obama is a reflection of the publics desire for something different
5857882 we believe that despite the rhetoric obama uses genuine change will always come from the bottom up and that means countering the system as a whole
5857883 people have learned that a top down approach to things doesnt work
5857884 what we have in common is a desire to break the spell that elections have over the us left
5857885 our message is one of direct participation in democracy bypassing corrupt politicians who dont represent us but instead further corporate interests
5857886 the rnc is a very easy target because they are so visibly to blame for whats happening in this country
5857887 theres a whole lot more energy for the rnc than the dnc
5857888 i dont know what to make of shutting down the rnc
5857889 id like to see more of a consciousness raising thing i dont want the left to be perceived as crazy
5857890 we know that it is the police not protesters or activists who will have the tasers guns rubber bullets concussion grenades chemical weapons helicopters the media spin machine and millions of dollars on their side
5857891 were just hoping that the denver police dont recreate the violence that happened in chicago in 68
5857892 it provides inspiration and an example of what can be possible
5857893 but it can also prove a disservice if we just recreate 68 we will be destined to also recreate its problems
5857894 that culture of activist summit hopping im not really into that i do think it is important to show a resistance to both parties i just think that there are different ways that people go about doing that and i hope we dont lose steam over this election weve got a long way to go
5857895 is to get to work organizing where we are at our campuses workplaces and in our communities while at the same time building links with people struggling all around the world
5857896 we really need to find a way to engage the people who are excited and really do think that obamas gonna change something
5857897 we have to do a lot of popular education to say that it isnt politicians who make real change its the movements that politicians have to follow
5857898 perhaps the most critical issue facing public education in a generation
5857899 were cutting the growth in the budget and if its that hard to cut the growth in the budget you can see how we got to this point
5857900 three reasons to reject governor patersons 1 billion in health care cuts
5857901 candidates who have shown a clear understanding of the needs and concerns of working men and women
5857902 i cant live with my son needing care and not getting it and people not caring what happens to him
5857903 when one of your children are harmed you go through the depression you go through the hatred you go want to retaliate physically
5857904 i didnt know if i wanted to cry spit cuss or just go bulldoze something
5857905 we have not been able to find anyone other than myself who has reported that criminal act to law enforcement
5857906 its not just for james but for other people that dont have anyone out there to take care of them
5857907 battlestar galactica marathon or maybe thats just me even the dali lama is said to have a passion for expensive watches
5857908 thats where i get my news except of course for the mercury news ive only got maybe 30 minutes a night to watch tv and ill take anything on comedy central i love the political satire i also really like south park especially kenny
5857909 how did you know my one problem with junk food is cheez its
5857910 my mother loved them and i have to stay away from them im not tempted by chocolates or anything sweet but i have to watch out for those cheez its
5857911 my guilty pleasure is ebay the most comprehensive museum ever imagined
5857912 i try to find at least one item there for each show just check out the 1960s rolodex file in our production of doubt center stage on sister aloysiuss desk i love the idea that the perfect detail is actually available somewhere and i can search the entire country to find it
5857913 on the weekend i like to let my hair down what little i have left of it
5857914 and just be a regular guy blend in with the crowd im a relaxed rider where you put your leather jacket on and sit back its definitely freedom you feel like its just you and the elements its refreshing
5857915 thats a secret pleasure for me i dont even know exactly why i like it so much except that is has dench and she could gargle and id love it
5857916 my foodie friends would not be pleased but whenever i need a little lift maybe every three months or so i eat an entire tub of frozen cool whip its soothing its cold and i love it
5857917 if i can hit the gym between 12 and 1 my guilty pleasure is to reward myself for sweating by watching the e news and then the daily ten on the e channel at least i can honestly say ive never watched it just sitting down
5857918 ill eat anything kraft macaroni amp cheese im old school i like the kind with the powder i also like liverwurst or fried bologna sandwiches because my dad used to make them hes german but honestly i am surrounded by the other stuff at work so when i get home i like to keep it simple
5857919 no not the unwanted messages you get in your e mail the spam luncheon meat that comes in the rectangular blue can i grew up eating it spam and eggs spam and rice spam musubi with sushi rice wrapped in seaweed i prefer not to create anything too complicated like the spam sandwiches suggested on its container id rather have pure unadulterated spam next time youre feeling a bit under the weather try this spam with macaroni peas and chicken broth yum
5857920 i love horror films not just because i crave the goose bump factor of a good evisceration but also because horror is one of the most metaphorically rich genres of the post modern age
5857921 horror is an allegory for existence teeth takes a bite out of sexism in society the last winter fast forwards to the rising tide of global warming even the granddaddy of modern monster movies jaws indicts the pettiness of business interests determined to keep the beaches open no matter whats in the water horror intimately reflects who we are what we want and what scares the capri pants off us from hamlet to hostel horror is as fundamental to human existence as comedy and tragedy its like beckett only with disemboweling whats not to love
5857922 but in terms of discussions today there is no doubt there are significant moves where our governments are moving in a similar direction
5857923 i dont deny we have a long path to walk but i am also very confident we are walking that path together
5857924 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
5857925 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
5857926 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
5857927 is most likely changing at its maximal possible rate which is insufficient to catch up to climate change
5857928 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run

5857933 no me digas esas cosas no no no es muy fuerte no quisiera ni siquiera hablar de eso no quiero hacer una nota amarillista de algo que ha sido tan hermoso en mi vida rbd es una cosa hermosa que nos ha pasado a todos y no quiero ensuciarla con este tipo de notas
5857934 esto hay que manejarlo con mucho respeto porque se habla de la vida de personas
5857935 a esto yo le llamo como el principio del fin de alguna manera y es una transformaci n porque evidentemente cada uno est persiguiendo sus sue os personales
5857936 esto es una decisi n mancomunada es una decisi n que el grupo ha tomado como necesaria para su propia evoluci n esto no es un mandato no es una decisi n personalizada de nadie sino es una decisi n que se ja tomado en conjunto
5857937 maite tambi n tom una decisi n personal de iniciar una carrera como actriz de televisi n y que en este momento los dem s tambi n en el caso de christian comenz su carrera haciendo cosas de teatro una serie de televisi n o sea como que el proceso natural al que el grupo ten a que llegar era ese no
5857938 llegaron a audiencias que no hablaban ni siquiera nuestro lenguaje hablemos de brasil hablemos de europa del este hablemos de rumania o sea hablemos de lugares donde rbd conquist
5857939 creo que fue el fen meno musical y art stico de los m s importantes que hemos tenido en la ltima d cada rbd es irremplazable como grupo yo creo que el fen meno rbd es un fen meno que nosotros que yo personalmente que lo he vivido en el mundo creo que es un fen meno irrepetible en este momento
5857940 es considerar esto como una transformaci n esto es cada uno de ellos emprender ya una carrera personal con metas individuales seguir n algunos cantando otros actuando
5857941 f jate que todav a no los promotores que se encargan de la distribuci n de rbd en el mundo est n trabajando todav a cerrando algunas fechas en lugares y no se ha definido exactamente cu ndo se cerrar a o cuando ser a el concierto m s cercano al fin
5857942 until now buying a home tended to be very family oriented
5857943 and living in a nice building with a lot of amenities was not as stressed
5857944 hey hey hey i live right upstairs just ask the doorman to dial 888
5857945 fue algo dif cil pero es una realidad llevamos mucho tiempo hablando y ahora es algo real que est pasando
5857946 fue una decisi n de los seis y es como un poco raro convocar a algo que t dispusiste es algo que ya se decidi que no sabemos cu ndo ser ojal dure much simo m s y agradecemos todo el apoyo pero lo importante es disfrutar al m ximo ahorita que estamos juntos
5857947 aunque sea complicado todos tenemos que crecer y nada puede durar para siempre
5857948 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5857949 john mccain is a rich out of touch elitist and doesnt understand the average american
5857950 me pareci raro porque yo pens que tendr a contratos firmados muy duros con pedro dami n y con televisa para desintegrarse pero siempre es la misma historia que sienten que ellos son los que hicieron el xito ya no ven todo lo que se les apoy cada quien quiere ser solista y luego no son nadie despu s se dan cuenta de que eran mucho m s fuertes juntos que separados es la misma historia de siempre
5857951 los chavos se vuelan mucho y piensan que el xito son ellos sin ver que fueron elegidos as como pudieron haber sido escogidos otros 50 mil que con el apoyo que tuvieron hubieran tenido el mismo xito el p blico fue quien los eligi quien los apoy en fin a mi me pas lo mismo una vez
5857952 este es el principio de la transformaci n del grupo pop m s importante de la ltima decada pero ser el p blico y los fans los que decidir n cuando va a ocurrir espero que los acompa en en cada una de las noches que faltan y juntos se despidan con ellos con la energ a del amor
5857953 estoy muy emocionada porque se que cada concierto ser inolvidable y nos vamos abrazar con los fans para siempre
5857954 the tracks are being laid and next year the money train will show up
5857955 good people bring good things out of the good stored up in their heart and evil people bring evil things out of the evil stored up in their heart for out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks
5857956 the opportunity to acquire an operating airport is quite rare and we expect strong interest from not only the aviation and logistics sectors but investors as well
5857957 it is apparent that there is an effect on their career progression
5857958 i think thats the way of the world i dont think the world was ever set up as a reasonable place
5857959 most senior management positions arent tailored in such a way that people can work on a part time basis and this is where the dilemma lies
5857960 certainly women with children are subject to greater levels of discrimination and barriers to their advancement
5857961 there is an old fashioned view of what is work and what is an ideal worker and that is a full time male
5857962 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5857963 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5857964 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5857965 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5857966 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5857967 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5857968 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5857969 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5857970 we really want to get the message out to people
5857971 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment

5857975 our eyes are so used to seeing it there that the work would seem unfinished if it was absent moreover it is to a certain extent necessary to hide the minor defects in calfskin
5857976 the data scandals unfortunately highlight how urgent this issue is
5857977 parliament must find a quick response to these blatant cases of abuse
5857978 people from the georgian security agencies asked me to block russian sites
5857979 there were threats from viruses we faced disinformation and so on
5857980 i hope that when war is over we will unblock these sites
5857981 the reason is that they broadcast disinformation during the war that affects our population badly and puts people under stress
5857982 i would not call it media what they broadcast and print is just propaganda and we dont want to scare our population with this disinformation
5857983 when we let them broadcast again we dont know lets see

5857991 the commission felt that there was a considerable public interest in the story itself in so far as it related to the delivery to the nursery school
5857992 the commission emphasised that there must be a powerful public interest justification for the use of undercover filming
5857993 there was insufficient justification for the filming on this occasion there was no dispute that the complainants son worked for the supermarket and the footage was not necessary to prove it
5857994 this shows that newspapers and magazines have to apply the pcc code to material that they put on their websites in just the same way that they do to their printed editions

5857997 im not saying that lee is innocent that he didnt know about the conspiracy or was not a part of it but i am saying hes not necessarily guilty of murder at first i thought that jack ruby who killed oswald two days after the assassination was swayed by passion all of america was grieving but later we found that he had connections with the underworld now i think lee was killed to keep his mouth shut i believe he worked for the american government he was taught the russian language when he was in the military do you think that is usual that an ordinary soldier is taught russian also he got in and out of russia quite easily and he got me out quite easily

5858017 a character building guide for you and your ministry team
5858018 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
5858019 to date what had been announced publicly doesnt appear in reality to be happening and a number of questions are being asked
5858020 the ioc is keen to see those questions answered by the relevant authorities
5858021 the games have not helped they have actually slowed down work that was progressing and increased abuses
5858022 i was pleased that we did some things we set out to do
5858023 we controlled the line of scrimmage and effectively ran the football
5858024 im not concerned at all im confident in the guys we have the guys we have will prove themselves in game situations and we just didnt do the things we wanted to do tonight
5858025 we had some mistakes that obviously need to be corrected
5858026 but we did some things we came in here to do
5858027 id be worried if we were playing baltimore on sunday but weve still got some time
5858028 well i think its pretty obvious that weve got a lot of work to do based on all three phases of the game
5858029 yeah i put a lot of stock in these games
5858030 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5858031 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5858032 there is still a lot of work to do before this city is fully recovered
5858033 and for people who are still hurting and not yet back in their homes a brighter day might seem impossible yet a brighter day is coming and it is heralded by hopeful signs of progress
5858034 its defined him a great deal in the publics mind
5858035 first impressions have ways of becoming lasting ones and certainly that was the case with katrina
5858036 its not the quantity of the visits its the quality of the visits
5858037 more like a supercharged comptrollers office than a supercharged recovery office
5858038 if its left abandoned certainly that isnt helpful to the redevelopment of either of those heavily damaged neighborhoods that surround it
5858039 in the 1900s and by the beginning of the 20th century switzerlands industrial sector was the largest and switzerland was the wealthiest country in europe by a considerable margin
5858040 in the 1990s switzerlands economy was marred by slow growth having the weakest economic growth in western europe which was marked by 3 year recession from 1991 to 1993 when the economy contracted by 2 also mirrored by a decrease in switzerlands energy consumption and export growth rates switzerlands economy averaged no appreciable increase only 0 6 annually in gross domestic product gdp after having unemployment rates lower than 1 prior to 1990 the 3 year recession also caused the unemployment rate to rise to its all time peak of 5 3 in 1997 and thus as of 2008 switzerland is only on the fourth place among european countries with populations above one million in terms of nominal gross domestic product per capita behind ireland denmark and norway and to tenth place in terms of gdp per capita at purchasing power parity see list on numerous occasions in the 1990s real wages decreased since nominal wages couldnt keep up with inflation however beginning in 1997 a global resurgence in currency movement provided the necessary stimulus to the swiss economy it slowly gained momentum and peaked in the year 2000 with 3 2 growth in real terms
5858041 theres nothing on our risk list that i would term a showstopper or major issue that we cant deal with

5858047 in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement prachanda is here
5858048 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
5858049 were in talks with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
5858050 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial

5858058 suffering has a noble purpose the evolution of consciousness and the burning up of the ego
5858059 when you accept suffering however there is an acceleration of that process which is brought about by the fact that you suffer consciously

5858063 it appears that we may have a position for all the employees who want to stay on
5858064 it is unreasonable to expect that another expert witness could step in at this juncture
5858065 senator obama will also make stops next week in several battleground states before arriving in denver
5858066 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5858067 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5858068 proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional one billion dollars in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5858069 senator obama opposes new drilling he said it wont solve our problem and that its not real he is wrong and the american people know it
5858070 the nation is sending 700 billion dollars every year overseas to countries that do not like us very much when i am president that is going to stop
5858071 president medvedev announced to sarkozy that the withdrawal of russian troops will be concluded august 21 22 with the exception of a team of 500 personnel charged with implementing additional security measures under article five of the august 12 agreement
5858072 invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of georgias infrastructure
5858073 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5858074 a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5858075 it isolates the vibrations just traveling through the structure all the way up to the seat
5858076 what we want to make sure of is that we dont get into a situation that would leave aftereffects with the crew
5858077 theres nothing on our risk list that is what i would call a showstopper or a major issue that we cant deal with
5858078 were concerned because it has been escalating during these last summer months it has gotten to the point where this guy is getting really bold he is not really shy about what he is after that is why we are concerned especially if a female is home by herself or with her children that is an obvious concern that we want to address
5858079 ill just be more aware to see if anything strange happens and look to see if anyone is there that doesnt belong maybe ill take a second look
5858080 it makes me kind of scared because i have a daughter and wife at home and for something to happen like that in this area is just terrifying
5858081 its really a humbling experience to see the way things are outside of this country
5858082 theres no traffic laws no car insurance no running water a lot of poverty
5858083 the first day we taught a clinic to the kids trey handed them a wrist band and a shirt for souvenirs and they cried we ended up giving them shoes and hats and it meant the world to them
5858084 we liked the idea and responded then they kept sending us information on it so we agreed to sign up together and made the trip together in late july to raleigh north carolina from there we flew to the dominican republic for eight days
5858085 we went down to play basketball but in the end it was all about those kids down there
5858086 they told us that on the average families earn about 100 american dollars per year its amazing how they get by
5858087 its a pretty dirty country so the kids are extremely grateful for everything we gave them
5858088 there was this one kid who was rooting for the other team we were playing i gave him a dollar one day which put a huge smile on his face for the rest of the tournament he wasnt just rooting for my team but me personally
5858089 handing out old t shirts shoes and shirts to the underprivileged kids down there that was the most fun i had i loved watching those kids smile it made the whole trip
5858090 as soon as i got back i had a new appreciation for all the things that i have
5858091 we knew that this would be one of the last times that me and my two best friends would be together doing the things we love the most so that made it special as well
5858092 inflation is way too hot and with housing way too cold we have the opposite of a goldilocks economy
5858093 new building codes enacted by new york city accounted for the big jump in permits and starts in june julys 23 6 percent drop in multi family starts and 32 4 percent drop in multi family building permits is mostly payback for junes strong numbers

5858098 a champion of democracy in his own country and throughout africa
5858099 worked tirelessly to uphold the values of good governance speaking out against human rights abuses and threats to democracy when many others were silent
5858100 his profound condolences to president mwanawasas family and to the people and government of zambia at this difficult time
5858101 a huge loss for democracy of which he was an ardent defender all his life
5858102 a great loss not only to the people of zambia but also to the southern african region and the entire african continent
5858103 may god punish them for the crime they have committed against these youngsters and their country
5858104 we condemn this attack its just another example of the reach of extremists and we would support the government of algeria as best as we can in trying to fight this scourge
5858105 its another reminder that terrorism can hit any place anytime anywhere and we all the international community have to stamp this out because in the end terrorism is a threat to all of us
5858106 once again the algerian people are victims of indiscriminate and barbaric terrorist attacks
5858107 to give up the armed fight and lay down their weapons
5858108 la retirada de tropas rusas concluir entre el 21 y el 22 de agosto a excepci n de un grupo de 500 personas responsables de la aplicaci n de las medidas adicionales de seguridad previstas en el quinto punto del acuerdo

5858118 that is why im proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional 1 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5858119 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5858120 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me
5858121 this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5858122 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5858123 the absurdity of this entire affair was best illustrated when john mccain called for coastal oil drilling and was cheered for it by his christian conservative audience for the most part this is an audience which believes that the earth is 6 000 years old yet it applauded plans to look for resources that exist due to the organic remnants of prehistoric organisms that took millions of years to accrue the fact that a future u s president has to suck up at this kind of a forum really gives global politics a surrealistic undertone
5858124 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
5858125 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5858126 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time

5858134 msnbc is shaking up its prime time programming lineup removing the long time host and one time general manager of the network dan abrams from his 9 p m program and replacing him with rachel maddow who has emerged as a favored political commentator for the all news cable channel
5858135 the exercise is a holistic approach in response to the immediate demand as well as long term development in the fss sector
5858136 the better known international schools are packed with no vacancies we havent seen that since the early 1990s
5858137 we will continue to strengthen our competitive advantages as a global education hub by attracting more fss to singapore in line with market demand

5858139 sharon called him and he showed the caller id to everyone
5858140 shes really into him and even asked him to come with her to mexico
5858141 somebodys got to walk the line in the country theyve got to walk it unapologetically and im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
5858142 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation
5858143 im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
5858144 im upset im angry it makes me feel like a nonperson kind of

5858149 en absoluto el celta es un equipo de tradici n conocido internacionalmente lo importante es estar en un equipo como el celta de vigo

5858166 the icjs final decision will not be binding but if serbias arguments are adopted it could slow down or block recognition of kosovo as an independent state
5858167 i believe that in the long run there will be no significant disruption of eu serbia relations and that in time some of the toughest advocates of this escalation will soften their position they need to realize that they should have an elementary respect for the issues that are important for serbia
5858168 this 915 000 grant made possible through the leadership of the general assembly is allowing us to protect waterfront land and preserve it for public use
5858169 in addition thanks to this collaboration with the n c division of marine fisheries which administers the fund well be able to make significant improvements expand the uses of this property and ensure continued access to our states public waters
5858170 the sunset harbor project was the type of multi use site we were looking to fund with the waterfront access and marine industry fund
5858171 not only will it ensure continued parking for an existing heavily used boat ramp a fishing pier will provide water access for those without vessels
5858172 the project was also a great example of how the division of marine fisheries and the wildlife resources commission can join forces to provide greater coastal water access for all north carolina citizens
5858173 gus durs mr wahids was a personal expression of views by a former president of indonesia whose stand and reputation we in malaysia are aware of

5858175 there is no perfect race and ive been involved in a lot of elections some are really painful thats politics
5858176 ill have another memorable story about life at the tribune
5858177 its sad because if you look at the list its heavily minority it looks bad
5858178 kass is standing right on top of me i can see all of the wrinkles in his shirt kind of a tan shirt he was that close to me his shirt was practically touching me he said youre calling me a racist something to that effect i said no im not i said i admire his work and he was screaming again i had to hang up the phone and at that point i had to stand up he was physically intimidating

5858182 by taking part in this australia wide campaign the people of lithgow can show the rest of the country that we are prepared to stand up and walk for what we believe in
5858183 it is solar and wind powered just in case the pollies need a hint and people power will get it to its final destination in canberra

5858186 so in two years approximately there will be a small era of ice that will last of 60 to 80 years
5858187 the present evidence does not support synchronous periods of anomalous cold generally or heat in this temporary frame
5858188 the process begins when the formation located in one of the arms of the argentine lake advances until the end of the peninsula of magallanes covering the drainage routes

5858196 its better to have tried in vain than never try at all
5858197 i have vetted all of the potential candidates thoroughly and after careful consideration have made the determination that our lord and savior jesus christ is the best possible candidate for vice president of the united states
5858198 jesus brings impeccable credentials to the ticket including a strong anti war agenda a compassionate policy towards the poor and down trodden in society and is a strong agent of positive change
5858199 i am proud to have jesus on the ticket with me and look forward to us bringing real change to washington
5858200 faced with relentless criticism from both the liberal bloggers and the right wing over his potential vp choices obama went for the smart and safe choice
5858201 jesus has no meaningful foreign policy experience and this underscores the weakness of the democrats on national defense
5858202 john mccain was an expert on national defense while jesus was still a baby in the manger
5858203 neither jesus nor obama are true americans i mean jesus wont even wear a flag pin on his robes it wouldnt surprise me if jesus born in bethlehem was some kind of arab islamo facist manchurian candidate

5858206 im super excited to begin work on this project porting devicescape to the openmoko
5858207 since im too cheap to have a big or really any data plan this is how i plan to be getting my e mail and pretty much everything on my openmoko
5858208 since it seems to provide the right mixture of bleeding edge while still being functional
5858209 to the best of my knowledge this is the first or one of the first non fic the manufacturer of the neo freerunner commercial applications being ported developed for the openmoko freerunner stack
5858210 i think that the advantage of having been a head coach
5858211 is you understand how you want you want your coaches to fit under the umbrella of the way the head coach wants the team to unfold
5858212 i was very fortunate at marshall to have outstanding assistant coaches with outstanding ability that had been at a lot of places but the biggest challenge was to make sure that we focused and stayed under the umbrella and with the scheme
5858213 when i got the job i looked at the tape
5858214 i looked at the tape to more familiarize myself with the scheme than to do an in depth evaluation of the players because i wanted to go into spring practice with a completely open mind and have everything start off equal that having been said outstanding players jump out at you and you notice it
5858215 being a veteran that he is what i see is with the great leadership is a great knowledge of the game
5858216 in other words just fielding his questions his questions are more advanced than a younger player he understands completely when you give the answer
5858217 basically right now when you go against yourself which weve been doing its really pretty hard to determine how good or how bad how strong or how weak you are
5858218 i think what coach groh has done an excellent job of is putting us in different situations to see how we handle them i think weve been put in a lot of situations where were getting better
5858219 i dont know of any defensive coach in the country thats two weeks away from his first ballgame thats not concerned about different parts of the game because were worrywarts
5858220 the fda is bowing to the chemical industrys influence and trying to convince the american public that this chemical is ok there is clear and credible evidence and more scientific studies showing links to the very health effects we see on the rise today
5858221 we wanted to develop an entirely new process technology for power
5858222 in many senses nehalem on the desktop is just more of the same
5858223 with the additional power management you can do so much more it turns the notebook into a pretty powerful device
5858224 not your fault not mine either the boy has issues
5858225 i confronted him on a few let us say inconsistencies of course he didnt quite see it that way
5858226 history is made in the forsaken places count your blessings for the opportunity
5858227 go back to your cell its going to be very tough on you now
5858228 were experimenting with this to sort of seed the community but eventually we do want to share some of the revenue with the user a few bucks can make a big difference depending where youre located
5858229 people had stories to tell but there was no place for them to tell them
5858230 i really wanted to create a discussion around current news and events a social networking community where anyone could report from anywhere in the world i believe to solve our issues we need to have a conversation and a dialogue as opposed to bombing people
5858231 we dont have a point of view well let the community figure it out
5858232 in the end the rock was simply too heavy for insana to keep pushing uphill on aug 8 he sent a letter to investors explaining why he was closing shop
5858233 our current level of assets under management coupled with the extraordinarily difficult capital raising environment make it imprudent for insana capital partners to continue business operations he wrote
5858234 in truth there are thousands of insanas desperately trying to raise money from nondescript little offices around the united states
5858235 although the big boys get most of the ink insanas is a far more common story and far more representative of what is happening in the land of hedge funds today
5858236 now that i got some more money to throw around i can come in here and take advantage of all their great hot food items and cold sandwiches
5858237 it feels like a bit of the pressure is off i was worried the prices would go way up
5858238 we make our money in the store so when people are just buying gas we collect money for the gas companies and we push it out we dont really hold on to much of that
5858239 ill usually pick up something at the deli something pierogies a sandwich
5858240 thanks for adding me as a friend now please digg all of my submissions
5858241 and surely struggle against him we must in every possible way who would annihilate knowledge and reason and mind and yet ventures to speak confidently about everything
5858242 when the power of love becomes stronger than the love of power we will have peace
5858243 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads
5858244 from the day we went to school we learned nothing on the contrary we were made obtuse we were wrapped in a fog of words and abstractions
5858245 ive always said that theres nothing an atheist cant do if hes really unsure whether he believes anything or not
5858246 881 was released in august last year and therefore i thought it was a nice round off to finish it one year later in the exact same month
5858247 we didnt really have much of a choice obviously the best time for us to screen in singapore was the seventh lunar month itself
5858248 some releases are time sensitive mad about english is about the chinese learning english for the beijing olympics 12 lotus is about getai which is more active during the hungry ghost month too
5858249 i am surprised by how many local films were released especially in this traditionally bad luck month
5858250 i really wanted it to be on aug 9 but it is such a small market so us local film makers dont want to fight each other
5858251 the nationalistic feeling from national day celebrations still lingers and i think that is a good draw for people to come and watch the reason is also to stir up feelings and bring back nostalgia it was a very important time for our nation
5858252 we want to offer audiences a variety to choose from each week we are more than happy that money no enough 2 held its own against a hollywood blockbuster such as the mummy 3 when they both opened on the same week
5858253 it reflects distributors growing confidence in local films and the healthy box office shows a maturity in appetite of cinema patrons
5858254 i think it says that singapore has its own voice in the movie industry and it wont just bow to exclusively hollywood releases or productions from bigger asian countries
5858255 of course the hope is that this will help push the bar higher and higher and more quality films will be produced locally someone here is eventually going to make the local film that really breaks out globally and that is very exciting
5858256 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
5858257 we had a baby weighing only 580 grams and she survived
5858258 never heard of such a case it was like a medical miracle

5858261 if lebanon becomes a hizbullah state then we wont have any restrictions in this regard
5858262 there will be public debate on the second lebanon war and its results on the way the war ended on un resolution and its impact on the country
5858263 the time for such integral public debate will come soon
5858264 yesterday 10 of our soldiers were killed in afghanistan and 21 others were wounded during a joint reconnaissance mission with the afghan national army
5858265 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hit hard

5858268 on august 20 21 2008 the president of the syrian arab republic bashar assad will make a working visit to russia at the invitation of russian president dmitry medvedev
5858269 we call on the government and judicial authorities to ensure the protection of prisoners to punish torturers and not to include them on amnesty lists
5858270 its true that there is no specific law but torturers could be charged for voluntary blows and injuries
5858271 the culprits are being investigated but this type of case takes time
5858272 we dont have statistics for previous years but there were definitely hundreds of cases of torture in 2004 and 2005 before the number started to decline in 2006
5858273 68 inmates died in prison for various reasons such as illness or mortar attacks but 14 cases are still under review because the death probably occurred under torture
5858274 there is also torture during interrogations carried out by inexperienced investigators who want to extort information or those who want to steal money
5858275 these six domestic companies have been given 13 months to find appropriate locations to build new atomic power plants
5858276 after finalizing the locations construction of the power plants can begin
5858277 darkhoin is under basic design and there has been a nine year scheme drafted for its construction
5858278 he believes that years and mutual confidence will be needed in order to reach these topics
5858279 three years ago i answered the call of prime minister sharon to help him found the kadima movement
5858280 today i am announcing my decision to answer the call of the acting prime minister livni and help her in her bid for the premiership
5858281 hizbullah was one of the parties that had agreed to
5858282 we have agreed in cooperation with lebanons general security to provide palestinians without official paperwork with an id
5858283 this step is to be followed by a study about the applicants and once the general security personnel make sure of their right to obtain an id they will get a temporary one
5858284 this card will settle the legal status of thousands of palestinians living in lebanon
5858285 and this number is to double as many undocumented palestinians were afraid of moving in the country and living in fear of discovery
5858286 i have hundreds of applications from palestinians who want to get a residence notice as a starting point toward getting an id
5858287 this temporary id will resolve social and legal problems which have caused many palestinians to lose their humanitarian life
5858288 this is the first summer since 2006 that large numbers of australian tourists have felt safe enough to return to visit lebanon on holiday
5858289 i like to be here to see family friends and to enjoy myself
5858290 its not to the benefit of anyone to have cases pending for two to three years
5858291 due to the fact that the life of the asylum applicant is at stake the examination of an asylum application is a time consuming procedure
5858292 this factor together with the big number of asylum applications pending needs to be taken into consideration in deciding how many more eligibility officers should be recruited for this highly responsible task
5858293 we try to improve the system but we cannot afford the financial and administrative pressure without the help and the assistance of the european union
5858294 they are better here in security than sleeping in parks
5858295 cyprus i had never heard of it before coming here
5858296 it is very boring here it is a bit like a prison
5858297 it is not easy but it is better here than in the city
5858298 here we have food at every meal and the hospital is near
5858299 a lot of migrants came for economic reasons and are told by traffickers to submit an application for asylum in order to prolong their stay or stay permanently
5858300 the majority of illegal immigrants or asylum seekers who come here enter from the turkish zone and turkey should be made responsible
5858301 we demand support from the european union in order to watch the green line and for pressure to be exercised upon turkey
5858302 to offer future physicians a comprehensive introduction to global health issues and to develop culturally sensitive students of medicine
5858303 you to learn about different methods and you can compare your knowledge with others
5858304 that is what makes the stay in beirut so special its not only about the studies but also about culture and people
5858305 the people i met during my stays in hungary and portugal belong to the best friends i have the friendships you form are really tight
5858306 i could also have gone to another european country but i wanted to experience something really new
5858307 this committee made up of the commander of forces involved on the ground and special judges must determine the reasons for this incident and the lack of coordination between the command in baghdad and iraqi forces
5858308 during the night iraqi forces from baghdad burst into the provincial council building arriving in humvee armored vehicles
5858309 they were hitting everyone they disarmed the guards and killed my secretary abbas al tamimi
5858310 the iraqi unit involved in the operation at the diyala governance center last night was not under the command of coalition forces
5858311 this was an iraqi planned and executed operation without the involvement of the coalition forces an american air weapons team was in the vicinity of the incident but did not engage any targets
5858312 a multi national division center soldier was killed as a result of a rocket attack on a forward operating base near amara
5858313 i saw two dead bodies and three women injured by mortar shells that crashed onto their house
5858314 im here to raise awareness which is a very important first step to ask for support for the georgian position and to highlight the fact that according to international law georgian territories are under russian occupation
5858315 we are alarmed by the situation the economy has been heavily targeted as well as the civilian infrastructure schools hospitals investments including arab investments were targeted
5858316 what happened in georgia is a message to all those who accept that washington entangles them in adventures miscalculated wars and dead end confrontation
5858317 in the end the us administration will abandon them because its interests are above anything else just as they did to their allies in lebanon
5858318 south ossetia was created as an autonomous region in april 1922 by the soviets but it was created to provide a pretense for intervention if one day georgia wanted to come out from the soviet empire
5858319 and the us political establishment and the european union have sent a strong message to russia georgians are very grateful for any support
5858320 it thought i can pressure georgia any way i want
5858321 our government was trying to use soft power schools amusements parks coffee shops and beaches in order to show our compatriots under the separatist ossetian regime that all of this was for them
5858322 which would make it possible to ratify the law during the extraordinary parliament session
5858323 entertainment for children during the summer to keep them off the streets
5858324 the armed conflict of may 2008 not only stopped all activities but it also paralyzed the ability of staff and women committees to re launch the enthusiasm based on an agenda previously set
5858325 peoples priorities shifted first to ensure security then to absorb the shock
5858326 i hope women in the village will understand what the goal of the project is
5858327 it is important for them to build relationships and respect each other and their opinions
5858328 the women can help children grow up in a good way
5858329 second they can build the relationships between the women in the village
5858330 they do not have an important role in society as any woman in lebanon
5858331 in some villages we realized that the municipality was not interested in such issues but we used them to get connected to local organizations because we want a fully supportive partner
5858332 women themselves saw skills of how training changes them they wanted to know how they can play a role so others could benefit
5858333 enhance the image of the politicians through my behaviour in front of 32 cameras
5858334 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5858335 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5858336 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5858337 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5858338 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5858339 if i want to getmarried the person to marry is xxx
5858340 if i want to get married i want to marry lang ping
5858341 young people in the past were a lot more subdued and were afraid of individualistic expression they were even fearful of stating their true opinions on romance and marriage let alone in idolising their sports heroes
5858342 use the most direct most obvious and most fearless way
5858343 sports is only one component but there are many other things apart from sports that can make us proud therefore there is no need to attribute any victories to this or that fighting spirit
5858344 inculcate the determined and unyielding spirit of the men and womens gymnastic teams among the young
5858345 many singaporeans complain that foreign retail staff are not proficient in english but theyre actually literate inenglish its just that theyve not had enough conversational practice and theyre not used to the way we speak english

5858347 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5858348 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon

5858350 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

5858352 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5858353 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5858354 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5858355 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5858356 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5858371 it was in a chicago hotel room three years ago that the architect of americas olympic basketball team realized that things had begun to change
5858372 wednesday night in beijing the us will face australia in the quarterfinals in winning its five opening round games the us outscored its opponents by an average of 32 2 points per game it defeated 2004 silver medalists greece by 23 world champions spain by 37 one british oddsmaker has listed them as 80 to 1 favorites to win gold the journey from athens began with the humility of realizing that the united states could no longer win gold merely by showing up every achievement has built from that moment from seminars to understand the mysteries of international refereeing to a willingness to play a defense so unrelentingly fierce that opponents have so far found no solution to it to many here including the players the redeem team is about recovering the gold medal yet for colangelo and head coach mike krzyzewski the team is something more the redemption in some degree of us professional basketball itself at a time when salary and ego sometimes threaten to overwhelm the technique and teamwork upon which basketball at its most sublime is founded this team represents an attempt to bring todays game back to the fundamentals the basketball played by the us so far could not help but inspire other teams in the tournament are much better 3 point shooters but the us has so far negated this by turning its greatest strength athleticism into a 40 minute assault it does not have a single player in the top 8 scorers or rebounders of the tournament yet it has scored 11 6 more points per game than the second highest scoring team australia more tellingly it has 18 more steals than australia the no 2 team in steals and it is tied for the tournament lead in blocked shots with china even though china has two players at least seven feet tall and the us none
5858373 the solution was to establish a true national team which trained together at various times throughout the year in las vegas
5858374 this is a humanitarian matter and not a political one
5858375 all attempts to change the aspect of this subject will fail because it is a living environmental and national issue that is related to peoples security and health
5858376 i also urge the council of ministers to make a courageous decision because peoples health is worth it
5858377 will continue every day until cabinet tackles this humanitarian issue

5858385 surprised at hostility created following rapprochement between any two lebanese groups
5858386 all efforts should concentrate on facilitating the launch of dialogue mechanism to tackle all pending issues
5858387 we still have to implement the third article of the doha agreement which concerns electoral law before we move on to the national dialogue
5858388 is committed to its quick implementation and the administration and justice parliamentary committee is putting the final touches on the final draft
5858389 different parties and factions in lebanon in order to achieve stability even if it aggravates some
5858390 some suggestions convey attempts to obstruct the dialogue such as the one released today demanding the completion of discussions over the electoral law before the national dialogue can begin
5858391 all disputes must be resolved within the dialogue sessions most importantly the issues of security and defense strategy
5858392 just fairytales because this would require a new doha agreement
5858393 a failed attempt to undermine the armys role in protecting national unity

5858406 the rift between the glc and the private sector over the minimum wage is still wide i tried to narrow the differences but to no avail
5858407 all that i can do now is present the case to the next cabinet meeting and offer my views and then the decision is for the government
5858408 the issue of the minimum wage will be among our top priorities in the government
5858409 we did not get a salary increase since 1996 and the cost of living from that year up to 2008 has risen by more than 60 percent
5858410 the government of late prime minister rafik hariri reduced the national social security fund nssf subscription on the employers by more than 25 percent in 2001 and despite this decision the private sector did not take a move to raise the salaries
5858411 the government has no right to impose the salary increase on the all the private sector because some companies are making more money than other firms such as the energy intensive factories

5858550 give policymakers and implementers a greater feel of how people really see our initiatives
5858551 while bloggers have the tendency to be overly critical we also swing to the other extreme when we really like something we wont just stop at talking about it on our blogs but also share with our friends through other channels
5858552 as social media gains prominence we do have a very high proportion of people especially teens who spend time online it is critical that organisations look at how we can leverage on this growth
5858553 its better to work with the people listen to them than suppress their views
5858554 it was a means to reach out to youths through their peers

5858557 unless they are prepared to have themselves held accountable for their writing i dont see how bloggers can equate themselves with professional media
5858558 to establish the same quality of objective and responsible reporting
5858559 i think it bloggers reporting could happen in the future but looking at the state of the blogsphere now i think the government would not be comfortable

5858602 this inaction on the part of board president jones is a failure of leadership and a disservice to the people of this county
5858603 the excuse being heard is that the cases are different while dann admitted wrongdoing dimora has not
5858604 the more telling similarity between dimora and dann is that the democrats seem more concerned with the political fallout in each situation than with what best serves the public
5858605 by waiting out the calendar jones and his fellow democrat insiders can ensure that their party gets to pick dimoras replacement rather than letting the people vote on a candidate this november

5858612 if russia had a different option of reacting to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have used it
5858613 but we didnt have this option when several thousand civilians are killed the state must act accordingly
5858614 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worse things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country

5858628 we told the airlines we would allow them if someone gave a birth date to exclude that person from the list
5858629 let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk just like everyone else some airlines have done this some have chosen not to because they dont want to spend the money
5858630 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
5858631 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
5858632 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll

5858644 he is an incredibly loyal person so i think he would do anything he could to protect somebody he believes deserves his support no 2 if he were to tell edwards then edwards would then have some link and some knowledge of it so if this was a way of protecting edwards i think it only makes sense to withhold that from the candidate
5858645 i dont think his loyalty would extend to violating the law or to blatantly misrepresenting something to a candidate or to the person who is employing him but i do think he would do whatever it took within those limits to protect someone he was loyal to

5858670 todays event would not have been possible without the strong support of the german chancellor her excellency angela merkel and her government from the time i discussed the issue of the partnership with her in june 2007 up till this moment she has remained steadfast in the pursuit of its actualisation

5858676 it is unacceptable that children have the odds stacked against them simply by default of having poorer parents the government must put its money where its mouth is and end child poverty so that all children no matter their background have equal chances to achieve a decent education
5858677 there has been an enormous programme of social reform over the past 10 years that has lifted 600 000 children out of poverty we are committed to accelerating this and to do this we are narrowing the gap in educational achievement between children from deprived backgrounds and those who are better off
5858678 there has been an impressive increase in recycling of domestic waste in the last few years but that only represents a tiny fraction of all waste generated in the uk
5858679 we would also like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
5858680 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway culture we currently have
5858681 eleven years after labour came to power almost two million children have left school without any good gcse passes

5858694 this is a difficult decision because of the great significance it has for mr schalchlin
5858695 the court must consider the interests of donald schalchlin and the public
5858696 in this case the interests cannot be completely reconciled if this case is left in juvenile court the public interest in community protection and safety is not reasonably met
5858697 if the case is transferred to superior court donald schalchlins very real need for comprehensive counseling and support will not be fully met
5858698 so the court must balance and weigh the competing interests and choose
5858699 although his maturity level and sophistication may be in favor of retaining juvenile jurisdiction that factor alone is not sufficient weight to support continued juvenile court jurisdiction

5858711 the logical expectation of the people from the president was that he immediately fire the vice president who made declarations that goes directly against the guidelines established by the late imam and his legitimate successor the great leader ayatollah khamenehi both of them ruling that all the zionists in the occupied land are usurpers bandits soldiers at the mercy of zionism but unfortunately the president has failed to respond to the wishes of the people it is time to correct that fault without delay
5858712 if the president continues to keep mr rahim mashai he would shot himself in the leg and would cost his popularity among the people
5858713 the nation and certainly the revolutionary guards could not close their eyes on a declaration that humiliates the proud of the iranian people in fighting the thieves and the killers who have occupied palestine what is more regretful is that the official who has made such a strategic mistake is a deputy to the president a figure of the principalists
5858714 contrary to what mr rahim mashai has said the great majority of the iranians are against the zionist entity israel and considers the zionists there as soldiers of that state that kills innocent palestinian people the legitimate owners of that sacred land
5858715 a former employee actually saw it on tv and called a colleague of ours and alerted us to the story

5858733 misalnya paderi kristian menyebut kalimah amin amen ketika melakukan upacara sembahyang di gereja maka umat islam tidak boleh dianggap meniru kristian ketika menyebut kalimah amin dalam sembahyang dan ketika berdoa

5858735 demi allah saya benar benar akan melaksanakannya demi penghuni kabah saya akan melaksanakannya demi kemuliaan allah saya akan melaksanakannya
5858736 sesungguhnya perintah nya apabila dia menghenaki sesuatu hanyalah berkata jadilah maka terjadilah ia
5858737 barang siapa bersumpah hendaklah dia bersumpah demi allah atau diam
5858738 barangsiapa bersumpah kepada selain allah maka dia telah kafir atau musyrik

5858740 sesungguhnya masjid ini tidak boleh di dalamnya ada sesuatu penganiayaan dan kotoran tetapi ini adalah tempat untuk bertakbir bertasbih dan membaca
5858741 lafaz sumpah itu betul mengikut ajaran islam tetapi tindakan memegang al quran dan berada dalam masjid tidak perlu dilakukan
5858742 dalam islam sesiapapun bebas bersumpah untuk membuktikan dirinya benar tapi bukanlah dengan memegang kitab suci al quran kerana ia adalah perbuatan orang kristian yang memegang kitab mereka ketika bersumpah
5858743 a lot of times these statements are overlooked people think they are joking
5858744 human behavior is subtle and complex at the same time
5858745 being able to judge someones actions is not an exact science
5858746 it really doesnt in the short term it will raise your blood pressure just transiently for a few minutes but it does not make you more likely to suffer from high blood pressure or hypertension in the long term
5858747 it can decrease your likelihood of getting parkinsons disease or diabetes it even ameliorates the symptoms of depression so it does have some good effects
5858748 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
5858749 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
5858750 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
5858751 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
5858752 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
5858753 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
5858754 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5858755 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5858756 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
5858757 i think its going to be fun and it really really feels good to be doing it again
5858758 frank and laurie are great friends one of the things that i thought about it was it was kind of unfinished business we kind of went out with a sigh more than a bang we want to come back and write another chapter
5858759 caring for a relative with a serious illness can be one of the most stressful times in a familys journey together
5858760 but it can also be one of the most intimate and meaningful experiences the website is designed to provide insight and practical information that can make the familys job much easier
5858761 as a society we are deeply indebted to the family caregiver these people need help to do what they do they need information and they need support services the irony is support programs are available but caregivers often dont know where to turn to find out about them thats where we decided we could make a difference
5858762 although we specifically designed the website to be helpful to family caregivers we also expect that it will gain popularity with local physician offices and other professionals that come in contact with families of the seriously ill
5858763 office staff can look up services on the website and print the appropriate pages to give to their patients and clients in addition there are resource pages with information regarding recent research findings and links to national websites offering continuing education materials
5858764 there are people with power who are cashing in on chaos exploiting bloodshed and catastrophe to brutally remake the world in their image these global profiteers now dominate our world raking in billions out of the tsunami plundering russia exploiting iraq this is the chilling tale of how a few are making a killing while more are getting killed

5858766 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5858767 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5858768 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
5858769 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5858770 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5858771 its important to remember that we are all engaged in a serious effort to bring about a stable afghanistan
5858772 france will continue to assume its responsibilities in favor of a democratic and peaceful afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism

5858782 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5858783 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that
5858784 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5858785 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5858786 we have all seen what the chinese have done it has been fantastic
5858787 but i am not intimidated by that we can have a show that is equally as fantastic without wasting money
5858788 during june 2008 we entered into an agreement in principal with ku to settle this matter for payment of 200 000 upon the parties entering into a definitive settlement agreement which are currently being prepared
5858789 we didnt want to tease the audience into thinking we were going to kill mac taylor
5858790 we want to shock them with wait a minute how did he get
5858791 mac is bleeding from the head and he has to orient himself to find out exactly where he is
5858792 its usually really cold when i have to do scenes like this
5858793 stellas in a helicopter searching for the car when she gets macs call
5858794 every time we come to new york we try to do something different for me to see the city from a helicopter is fantastic
5858795 obviously the show has had a few losses but riley has no idea whats going on
5858796 i hope the character will bring a little bit of fresh energy and a lighter feel to the show
5858797 for the first time in our group we have somebody who wasnt mentored by grissom so she has a very different relationship with him

5858816 i know of no monuments to him though if his centennial is celebrated aright it should be possible to erect a number of them within this generation but they should be rough hewn and cross shaped to symbolize the kind of man his was and the kind of message he heralded
5858817 he had shown the way out of rationalism and formalism and the revival which took hold made norway a new and better land made it blessed and a blessing for years to come
5858818 no more took part in the worldly pleasures of his companions

5858870 to assess how epilepsy influenced pope pius ixs life and his papacy
5858871 the main lesson learned for me is that neurological diseases such as epilepsy have a stigma that can often be used by both enemies and allies of individuals to further their interests enemies of those with epilepsy can simply state that the work of those people with epilepsy is tainted or clouded by their seizures whereas supporters simply point out that epilepsy is an obstacle to overcome
5858872 two important findings in pius ixs history are likely responsible for his epilepsy
5858873 as a youth in italy pius ix annually went to visit his mother at the shrine of our lady of loreto when he was small he fell into a stream after which he was frequently tortured with fatigue and fever the doctors were never able to pinpoint the cause
5858874 the vestiges of epilepsy were clearly visible pius ixs body was slightly less developed on the left this could be seen even in the face which was asymmetric with lips awry and a head that inclined to the right the subject was considered highly impressionable capricious impulsive and unpredictable these characteristics were all attributed to epilepsy
5858875 im leaving a fantastic organisation with wonderful people and its been a tremendous journey and its a shame its coming to an end

5858878 hes been more than satisfactory in his performance over the years
5858879 im very disillusioned i believe that there are electronic record solutions out there and that district health boards together should have been able to come up with something to solve the problem
5858880 when you think where else that money could be spent
5858881 for people being born today electronic records are going to be great but the problem is astronomical when we are virtually castrated by legislation that says how long we have to keep records after people are dead
5858882 if the solution was easy we would be doing it
5858883 our teams in gori are seeing a significant level of damage from the fighting

5858936 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5858937 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5858938 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5858939 and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5858940 what women can do is start putting themselves up for promotions and making it quite clear that they actually want to be promoted ms broderick told the nine network
5858941 when we women come back into the workplace we are now a person with a visible caring responsibility and thats what actually is impeding on us in our progress to more senior roles
5858942 the fact is that there arent many jobs at the most senior levels that can be done in some kind of flexible manner she said
5858943 sometimes they dont give you quite a clear cut result so we have to do further tests on those samples
5858944 a lot of people feel like they wasting time because they aint got no goals
5858945 by the end of the session commodities have given up about half their gains whereas the euro and aussie are still trading close to their highs
5858946 were still bullish on the us dollar but having gone up so rapidly and so much in advance of what interest rate differentials are doing there comes a point where market dynamics suggest that there could be some vulnerability
5858947 the story that we have is ongoing pressure on global economies ongoing pressure on commodities and ongoing pressure on commodity currencies
5858948 it doesnt add up to a very positive aussie dollar picture
5858949 its good news yesterday we believed there were 11 people unaccounted for we are confident that those 11 people have been located identified and are safe coconino county sheriffs department spokesman gerry blair said
5858950 it is possible of course that some people did not check in so with that possibility in mind we are continuing to search the creek from the air mr blair said
5858951 so far we havent found anyone who appears to be stranded
5858952 the radio came on a minute or two before 8am on the morning of august 21 1968 it always did that was the start of family routine in our north london home this morning however was shocking and unforgettable the bbc bulletin led on the news that 165 000 warsaw pact forces had invaded czechoslovakia from all points of the compass i was born in czechoslovakia in 1936 moving to england with my family when i was three my first thought that morning was for my relatives living mainly in moravia ann and i newly married had visited them in 1961 we had experienced the dragooning of small town life the public loudspeakers barking out instructions to the farmers

5858977 as mark twain once said when one has tasted watermelon he knows what the angels eat i encourage my colleagues to join me in acknowledging the wisdom of mark twain by supporting this resolution
5858978 we also recognize that we have more to do and we will do so both in the remaining weeks of this years congress and next year when we will have expanded democratic majorities in the house and the senate working with president barack obama
5858979 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
5858980 resolutions are fine but why arent we also passing legislation to lower gas prices what about health care reform and runaway entitlement spending
5858981 not only do you create heat stroke awareness month every year after that you recognize the importance of heat stroke awareness month you never move on to substantive legislation

5858985 what once was a nice running river was suddenly an incredible torrent of water washing through the area
5858986 the 150 foot clear blue green waterfall had turned to mud
5858987 if you were caught in the river it would be really hard to survive
5858988 we believe we have a pretty good handle on who was down there but there is a possibility that there may be people in the canyon were not aware of
5858989 oh is that what you want now let me show you where he keeps the porn
5858990 precisely the face of the republican party that needs to be shown at this convention
5858991 our little bridger gave a wave to the doctors today and little grin
5858992 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
5858993 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
5858994 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
5858995 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
5858996 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5858997 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5858998 yeah definitely all the players here are trying to make an impression all i can do is give 100 percent and try and get back in the squad
5858999 it is not a problem for me being back in the under 21s i will just give 100 percent for the under 21s and hopefully it will be enough to get back into the squad
5859000 we have got a good squad of lads here and it is not just me who can move up you know there is james milner and i dont want to mention names but there is loads of us that can move up and hopefully we can do
5859001 if you asked me what i was looking for going into the game obviously a clean sheet obviously a few goals and a good performance
5859002 i got bits and pieces of everything and not everything that i was looking for to be honest with you
5859003 but we will go away and look at it again when we meet with the coaches but it has certainly stood us in good stead that is for sure going into the portugal game at wembley
5859004 it was a mixed bag really i know we can certainly play better than that you should never underestimate winning certainly at international level as well so that is a positive to take from it
5859005 we had maybe five or six that competed for their clubs on sunday so obviously we were aware of that situation and maybe one or two tonight had not featured for their clubs this season yet
5859006 but we can pass the ball better and we can play better than that but every step at this age group is a learning curve for the players
5859007 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5859008 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5859009 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
5859010 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
5859011 well just try to match up the best way we can
5859012 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out
5859013 i do not necessarily determine the role the relief pitcher determines the role
5859014 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a can any of yall throw
5859015 the reality is true proven guys are not going to get through
5859016 i feel comfortable that the answer when billys not here is in that room
5859017 the guys in there are going to have to step up i think weve got the guys
5859018 were not the only team that goes through this and we have to find a way to get it done
5859019 vi har ikke nogen egentlig lovgivning som specifikt handler om overgreb mod ldre ligesom man har i andre lande og vi har stort set ingen forskning p omr det eller videnscentre og ingen specifikke telefonlinjer eller krisecentre hvor de svage ldre kan s ge hj lp der burde v re nogen der tog meget seri st fat p det
5859020 volden er forkastelig i forhold til vores moral herhjemme hvor selvbestemmelsesretten er i h js det og hvor vi ellers bryster os af en god ldreomsorg og handicappolitik men jeg tror samtidig at det er en mindre procentdel af dem som beg r overgrebene der handler direkte uf lsomt og brutalt over for de svage ldre resten glemmer snarere i misforst et over omsorg at inddrage den ldre og kommer derfor til at foretage handlinger der kan tolkes som overgreb derfor er det ogs vigtigt med oplysning og information

5859025 brazil always has dreamed of the gold too bad we never seem to win it well just have to wait another four years
5859026 its especially difficult because it was argentina its difficult to lose at any time but to lose to argentina is a tremendous shame
5859027 brazil didnt show the spirit demonstrated by argentina its that simple the defeat was deserved
5859028 queenstown is this little kiwi town that was up against london paris and new york big cities and big competition
5859029 to win recognition with a community chest card as the adventure capital of the world is quite an achievement and to merit the creation of a special kiwi bonus pack is incredible testament to our reputation as the leading lake and alpine destination in the southern hemisphere
5859030 id really like to thank everyone who voted for us the response we had was amazing and we wouldnt have gained the profile we did without the support from everyone in queenstown new zealand and kiwis all around the world
5859031 the monopoly board game is the most popular board game in the world and to be a part of it gives the queenstown brand a global reach its the type of international exposure that money cant buy and we hope it inspires visitors to come and discover queenstown for themselves
5859032 its time the law started protecting and putting the welfare of children and families first
5859033 the current law is far too liberal and vague and needs to be amended
5859034 it is topless people men and women in a public place which is perfectly legal under our bill of rights and under new zealand law
5859035 mr mccoskrie keeps harping on that it is pornography they are breasts theyre not a big deal
5859036 it effectively means any topless parade can be held at any time on any street yet this attitude goes against prevailing community standards demonstrated by the fact that we would not allow topless teachers office workers or mcdonalds staff
5859037 tacky actually i think we actually give this guy way too much media airtime for promoting something that is well hes got a pretty cynical view get as much media attention as you can
5859038 its not exactly the brazilian carnival is it its pretty tacky
5859039 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
5859040 you have to have a willy to get anywhere in this council
5859041 that sexism is the only thing i can think it is i cant think of any other reason ive been overlooked
5859042 i dont know what you have to do to be taken seriously as a business person in this city
5859043 i think it might sort of reflect partly that we havent released all our policies yet so they dont know what the tax policy looks like and all those sort of things at this point and obviously we are working our way pretty quickly now through those
5859044 if the public cant trust you and you dont keep your word in office you wont last there i want to lead national to victory but also want to lead national in government for a long period of time
5859045 keep our word and our bond with the new zealand public
5859046 i dont think they understand actually whats happening here in terms of what we are proposing
5859047 were talking about having it at the most at 22 percent a very low level
5859048 we need to build infrastructure if we want to grow without inflation to deliver higher wages to deliver a really bright future we need that infrastructure
5859049 female porn stars are paid big money to simulate scenes of rape sexual violation and degradation for the purposes of male sexual arousal and gratification
5859050 it is underpinned by attitudes and messages many of which are fuelled and normalised by the hard core porn industry

5859052 noyes has threatened to kill me and my family and will not rest until we are dead all the evidence you need is in his computer and that little girls mind please save her
5859053 extreme punishments such as locking her in a closet with no food for three days
5859054 i use to go out with big malcolm down the road till he dumped me
5859055 no way josie and the pussy cats im gonna save planet earth as i fly my big assed jet back to the west coast and check on my vineyards so kiss my hoo haa evil oil drinking republicans and americansky peoples bleh
5859056 water is a resource yet in some respects it is a commodity its as essential to human life as air that puts water in a different class
5859057 recently i came across a few pieces of the puzzle that have been mostly unknown to the public
5859058 had overstayed his tourist visa and now made a living in new yorks high turnover illegal immigrant work force waiting on tables
5859059 no information tying him to the democratic convention later this month in denver or to terrorism
5859060 this document is a very clear statement that this alliance nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union in achieving a europe that is whole free and at peace is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5859061 the way nato assesses the fulfilment of this condition is biased they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side
5859062 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
5859063 the resolution is a waste of time let me tell you its a waste of time because the process of the withdrawal of russian forces will continue
5859064 theres no signs as i mentioned that they are preparing for the withdrawal
5859065 in gori no one told us to leave or helped us to leave no one no car would stop now i see that we must take care of ourselves even here
5859066 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5859067 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5859068 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5859069 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5859070 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5859071 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5859072 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5859073 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5859074 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5859075 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5859076 hrmarketer com has proven to be a terrific tool in identifying promotional and editorial opportunities
5859077 when you add the capability to evaluate those opportunities through the eyes of industry peers via the hr community you have an invaluable resource that i frankly couldnt live without hrmarketer com has saved me countless hours of research allowing me to focus on execution and driving bottom line results
5859078 this is the first major redesign for hrmarketer com since our launch in 2002
5859079 were not only responding to the needs of our members but are also working to keep them ahead of the changing technology curve
5859080 failure to properly maintain dryer vents is a major contributor to clothes dryer fires
5859081 there were rumors about a sex tape but i had nothing to do with that god knows the truth in all of this and at the end of the day that is the only thing that matters jesus was persecuted and im going to get persecuted ya know
5859082 i have been the most religious person since i was 2 years old i always felt this crazy connection to god
5859083 my office has had many calls from people all over nsw wanting to know if there would be a memorial service in honour of mick and i am very pleased that the clough family have endorsed the service
5859084 it will be a wonderful celebration of micks contributions to the labor movement and the general community which he served so loyally for so many years
5859085 i was the one bloke to beat mick in the general election of 1988 he returned the compliment to me in 1991
5859086 i found mick a forthright gentleman he had the interests of the electorate firmly in his heart before anything else
5859087 he gave his heart and soul working for the battlers of the world
5859088 he didnt always toe party lines but he was a labor man to the core
5859089 there are excellent numbers again this year with lots of school participation which is lovely
5859090 we also offer a special schools section with performances by carenne and various individuals
5859091 the concert will showcase the wonderful talent seen throughout the competition
5859092 weve also completed fencing the road and removing the cattle grids
5859093 however funding for the installation of the guard rails will not be available until the 2009 10 financial year
5859094 along with the development of the cabins this project can only enhance the dams reputation as a popular recreation facility
5859095 its another project which council have completed and comes as a result of several years planning
5859096 were already planning on hosting the nsw country championships at the dam this season
5859097 and most of our club races will also be able to be held out there now the roads been sealed
5859098 the potential to host major events at chifley dam is enormous
5859099 due of the speed cars are travelling there is no way i can get in and out of my driveway safely
5859100 reversing into my driveway is impossible with the increase in traffic here particularly when the b double trucks swing through the intersection
5859101 i have contacted council about getting the speed limit reduced but i have had no luck so far
5859102 he must have been in a lot of pain but he didnt complain
5859103 steve worried himself sick about what it was doing to him every time he hit a bump
5859104 he was afraid that the bone would poke through the skin if he jolted him too hard
5859105 i thought they should have taken him by ambulance but an ambulance was never mentioned
5859106 they wouldnt even give me a wheelchair they loaned me one to get to the car but a wardsman came with me and took it away again for the next two days we had to carry him everywhere
5859107 thats what scared me the most he weighs 23kg without a cast and i was terrified i would drop him
5859108 they fixed it and told me to make my own way home
5859109 i was told there was no funding no staff and no way to take me back to bathurst
5859110 i managed to find a friend who could bring me home the next day even though it wasnt convenient
5859111 ten days later the same thing happened again but this time they kept me in orange for a week
5859112 i wanted to go back to bathurst but they wouldnt let me go home
5859113 the staff at the hospital were really good and took care of me
5859114 but no one could come all the way to orange to visit
5859115 because this happened suddenly i didnt have anything with me and i had to rely on staff and people in the ward to provide me with toiletries and things out of the goodness of their hearts
5859116 the real solution to the problem is for bathurst to have a full time orthopaedic surgeon
5859117 however there is a shortage thats part of the problem

5859137 after hitting the fast forward button a few times i got to usas national anthem where the camera pans on each of the players as the anthem plays each player has their hand over their heart and seems very grateful to represent the usa the camera continues to pan over each player until it gets to the back row of players where team usas two centers dwight howard and chris bosh have their hands behind their backs neither one of these guys had the respect courtesy or even patriotism to put their hands over their hearts during the national anthem like the rest of their teammates am i missing something here is this not the olympics where you are representing your country against all other countries even in a regular nba game you should put your hand over your heart during the national anthem so it boggles me even more so they did not do it during the olympics maybe chris bosh has spent too much time in toronto and forgot how that works dwight claims to be superman but other than apple pie and baseball nothing is more american than superman no excuses for him i lost all respect for these two stars my vote is to force these two to sign with a european team like the rest of the clowns that have left the good ol usa in search of the almighty dollar
5859138 theyre my favorite theyve always been my favorite being in an arcade and actually being in a car and racing in a booth thats my experience so the whole controller thing and doing that now thats totally new to me but these worlds that they create are so real and so unbelievably fun and there are so many obstacles and its just so layered before it used to be youre racing around a track youre racing against someone and the point is not to bump someone and now the point is to not get caught by the cops and to not damage your car not to you know what i mean its incredible
5859139 unlike a movie when youre shooting something like this youre definitely taking a piece in a world and youre integrating it into another world so because i didnt design the game i dont know this world and thats not my thing when you have a movie script you know from a to z where its going
5859140 with this we kind of had to really sit down and be very specific about where we are in the game and what our motivation is and what were trying to say and where were trying to bring the player its very very technical so in that sense it is very difficult
5859141 im not interacting with the other actors im not doing any of that but i need to know where theyre at in the story what their characters are doing so i have to do a character study on them because im not interacting with them because if i dont i dont know what im doing
5859142 thats very different because in a movie im meeting the other actors when were acting and were actually talking about where were going with chase that plan is hers entirely but to know the other characters back stories and then be able to move forward with them she does that on her own
5859143 but for this the production value is so high and so incredible great sets great director great crew great script i had nothing to complain about
5859144 its a huge challenge for archivists to deal with digital information
5859145 one of the most interesting problems for digital preservation is interactivity and how difficult that is to preserve
5859146 when you are trying to preserve anything you are trying to preserve the most important things about that artifact
5859147 with videogames we do not yet know what is important
5859148 we want to raise the consciousness in the industry about how important these records are
5859149 i do not think they save anything or its saved in such a way that they would not be able to recognize the significance of what they are holding
5859150 you cannot just throw everything into a box and put it in the attic so in 50 years your kids can look at it
5859151 the raw formats that camera capture images in are proprietary in nature so this raises issues about accessibility if the information about that raw format is lost
5859152 as more and more information is published in e only formats the legislation must keep pace so that we as digital librarians can keep this information safe without the threat of legal issues hanging over us
5859153 we are far from drowning in digital data as our skills have come a long way its more a case of not drowning but waving
5859154 the offer is very compelling in that it provides ausdrill shareholders with an above average takeover premium and provides them the opportunity to participate in a larger company with improved geographic and business diversification
5859155 the acquisition provides macmahon with increased scale in contract mining new capabilities in exploration drilling and increased geographic reach through ausdrills african operations
5859156 a continuation of the current market conditions would again impact our revenues and profitability in 2009
5859157 our environment has a defining influence on the performance of our business and we were clearly not immune to these market forces in 2008
5859158 as fellow shareholders we are disappointed this years results have not been consistent with previous results which delivered total returns for our shareholders in excess of 30 per cent per annum in the decade up to 2007
5859159 firstly we must continue to invest in our strategic priorities
5859160 secondly we must maintain our conviction for the way we manage money
5859161 finally we must respond to the overall decline in market levels by continuing to review elements of our cost base
5859162 we will achieve this through tight control of expenses targeted and tailored marketing investment and ensuring an inventory balance consistent with sales
5859163 against a backdrop of flat to negative economic outlook for retail for the first half at least we are focussed on ensuring the business is trading at peak performance and ready to capitalise on the eventual upturn in activity
5859164 despite economic conditions we remained focussed on core brands and delivered profitable growth
5859165 despite its stable of strong brands pacific brands has not been completely immune to the recent downturn
5859166 we have found the top end manchester market and womens fashion footwear to be particularly sensitive to the change in consumer sentiment
5859167 media reports have suggested mr green could step aside as early as this week
5859168 the company is aware of ongoing media speculation relating to management and board changes
5859169 while no decision has been made a subcommittee of the companys board is meeting on the morning of thursday 21 august 2008 when necessary information is available to them to consider and make a decision on board changes as part of our response to corporate governance issues that have previously been raised and management changes in the context of our announced strategic review
5859170 the company is not in a position to release any announcement pending the result of that board subcommittee meeting
5859171 macmahon already has 1 2 billion of revenue secured for the 2009 full year and as per previous guidance is expecting to deliver annual profit growth of 20 to 30 per cent
5859172 subject to the timing of new work 2009 full year profit growth is likely be at the higher end of the 20 to 30 per cent range
5859173 notwithstanding the current turmoil in world financial markets and slowing economies the demand for contracting services remains strong particularly within the iron ore coal and government sectors
5859174 results were significantly affected by further declines in the us housing market where housing starts fell 35 per cent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year
5859175 our main businesses operated in markets that were affected by downturns particularly in the us where the downturn was the most severe
5859176 despite this we continued to focus on driving primary demand for fibre cement products in north america with strategies aimed at increasing our share of the us siding and backer board markets
5859177 although we expect our volume to remain below prior year as a result of a continuing decline in housing markets we expect our differentiated product strategy will allow us to maintain selling price and increase market share

5859208 there is growing and compelling evidence that mental health and wellness promotion can make a difference both for people who are already confronting mental health problems and illnesses in their lives and for society as a whole there is also a growing sense here in canada as elsewhere that it is now possible to bring mental health issues out of the shadows forever

5859210 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
5859211 despite the strong performance and excellent positioning of our airports security price performance has been disappointing so far in 2008
5859212 whilst this is primarily a consequence of external factors beyond maps control action has nonetheless been taken to address this security price underperformance
5859213 feedback from our active program of engagement with investors has highlighted a changed attitude towards acceptable levels of leverage
5859214 boards and management are also seeking to address the gap between the current security price and the security value implied by directors valuations reaffirm the quality and sustainability of distributions and reinforce maps commitment to its traditional investment discipline
5859215 proportionate ebitda growth of 9 6 per cent in the face of the current external environment represents an excellent achievement and demonstrates the significant value which has been generated by the aeronautical and commercial initiatives map has underway at our airports
5859216 we recognise that our airline customers face challenging conditions but the first half result is evidence of the importance of investing in airports with attractive characteristics and opportunities across the aviation and commercial businesses
5859217 whilst our financial position is very sound we recognise that attitudes towards leverage have changed if not permanently then for the foreseeable future
5859218 consequently we are applying our surplus cash to the repayment of our hybrid capital instrument tickets which will simplify maps capital structure
5859219 whilst there is no provision for early redemption we are offering tickets holders a withdrawal option with any remaining balance to be defeased and repaid on 1 january 2010
5859220 the discount to valuation which the current security price represents remains near record levels
5859221 a buyback of this scale also aids the quality and sustainability of our distributions and our commitment to achieve broad convergence between our regular distribution and proportionate earnings by 2010
5859222 conducted at prices that reflect our full directors valuations generating substantial premia to the prices for maps original investment of 49 per cent for copenhagen and 47 per cent for brussels
5859223 importantly map will exercise joint control over both investments whilst retaining exposure to their future growth
5859224 asur meets maps key investment criteria and we expect the returns from this investment to be well above that offered by current and proposed major airport privatisations
5859225 we believe this investment demonstrates maps continued ability to source attractive growth opportunities
5859226 the strong first half result is evidence of the stability of our earnings despite a volatile external backdrop and coupled with our proactive portfolio and capital review places map on the firmest possible footing for the future
5859227 the decrease over december 31 2007 reflects a comprehensive review of business and financing plans to incorporate all announced airline capacity reductions and the directors view of financing outcomes in both the short and long term
5859228 in addition asset specific risk premia have been increased to reflect the uncertainties created by the current external environment
5859229 map and its airports are in a strong operational and financial position
5859230 the boards and management of map consider the outlook for the rest of 2008 to be solid
5859231 the trading conditions in the first half of 2008 were more difficult than in 2007
5859232 cca maintains its guidance of high single digit ebit growth for the second half of 2008 with a target of around 7 per cent ebit growth before significant items and on a continuing operations basis
5859233 the result has been driven by well balanced revenue and mix management and tight cost control programs across the business
5859234 this is a particularly pleasing result given the increasingly challenging economic environment in many markets and it confirms the strength of our business models
5859235 we continue to win significant new business in both existing and new markets and we have made excellent early progress in the implementation of our growth strategy
5859236 our performance makes me optimistic about the medium to longer term growth outlook for brambles
5859237 by the end of the session commodities have given up about half their gains whereas the euro and aussie are still trading close to their highs
5859238 were still bullish on the us dollar but having gone up so rapidly and so much in advance of what interest rate differentials are doing there comes a point where market dynamics suggest that there could be some vulnerability
5859239 the story that we have is ongoing pressure on global economies ongoing pressure on commodities and ongoing pressure on commodity currencies
5859240 it doesnt add up to a very positive aussie dollar picture
5859241 at some point in time just got to figure out what the heck it is obviously its not what i want but i think at this juncture its something that needs to happen obviously theres something going on

5859253 i will make the eradication of poverty a top priority of the mccain administration
5859254 my top priority today and it will be my top priority tomorrow
5859255 a top priority needs to be putting private capital to work in research and development
5859256 as president the nations security will be my top priority
5859257 john mccain will make ensuring the personal security of americans a top priority of his administration

5859268 these results confirm that the confidence we have expressed in the past six months about our guidance was well founded
5859269 our balance sheet is stronger and gives us the flexibility to pursue disciplined growth from a number of identified opportunities
5859270 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
5859271 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
5859272 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
5859273 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
5859274 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
5859275 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
5859276 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

5859357 nu stiu sa scriu si ce as mai scrie mai bine mi aplec inima sa si lase amprenta aici pe h rtie
5859358 traiesc cu sentimentul ca pot triumfa in multe domenii si ca pot deveni un om marcant al istoriei ce o vor citi nepotii mei insa lenea ma impinge sa traiesc viata unui simplu muritor dar am de gand sa schimb asta
5859359 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to
5859360 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
5859361 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
5859362 is most likely changing at its maximal possible rate which is insufficient to catch up to climate change
5859363 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run
5859364 practitioners can now go beyond therapy on the basis of ethnicity into the precisely targeted arena of personal genomics
5859365 i cannot resist an inclination to communicate to others an acquaintance with those delicious scenes
5859366 i am sure over the next two weeks people from around the world will get to know a lot more about what london has to offer and what they can look forward to in 2012
5859367 and no one questions them no one questions the chinese
5859368 theyre so much less negative but weve got that negative culture havent we with all the questions and freedom of information requests about how much everythings costing its just a negative
5859369 it was worrying to see that the guys who performed best in saturdays friends provident trophy final were all south african or zimbabwean somethings not right with the system if england beat south africa it will be in spite of that system not because of it
5859370 alas the absolutists who would have had her banished into the sporting wilderness in perpetuity need little provocation in their world of moral certitude everything she does is provocative including winning her olympic gold medal an act that will presumably act as the starting gun for a fresh assault on her reputation and credibility
5859371 if uk athletics supported her when she sought to challenge the olympic ban then why did it fail to support dwain chambers these are legitimate questions the latter in particular
5859372 if uk athletics supported an athlete who had negligently failed to comply with testing rules but had repeatedly tested negative and against whom there was no evidence of doping then why did it fail to support a second athlete who was a proven and admitted cheat
5859373 there is no suggestion that she is guilty of taking drugs and indeed this case can be viewed in all the circumstances as a busy young athlete being forgetful
5859374 its a dog its ok you can get another one relax
5859375 the message that it sends is its ok to grab a hold of somebody and shake them up a little bit make them frightened
5859376 its a good thing my husband wasnt home that day because the police never would have been involved
5859377 its become more important with the top two if you want your candidate in the general you cant assume they will be there you have to get out and vote
5859378 i think thats going to drive turnout in the race
5859379 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5859380 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5859381 i am really honored to be selected as the new swimming and diving coach here at western
5859382 i have talked to the previous two coaches and they have talked about the tremendous support from the administration and i am excited to become a part of the athletic staff
5859383 i plan on setting the bar high and having high expectations for the team
5859384 i hope to have swimmers and divers qualify for the united states open while pushing them to new heights
5859385 with sound principle and discipline i look forward to helping the athletes accomplish their dreams in the pool and in the classroom whatever they may be
5859386 are switching from company owned hardware and software assets to per use service based models
5859387 this whole cloud thing is about shifting assets away from enterprises and to service providers
5859388 the impact on overall it spending would be neutral to negative but all sorts of new uses and new companies may spring up on the back of the cloud phenomenon and no one knows what those might be yet theres a big unknown we cant put a metric on it
5859389 cyclospora is a small bowel pathogen after ingestion cyclospora oocysts excyst in the gi tract and invade small bowel epithelia where they undergo asexual division followed by sexual division and produce mature oocysts that are shed in the stool
5859390 business casual in the workplace has really opened up the blur in gender lines
5859391 the ability for both men and women to dress down at work is presenting more options for wardrobing
5859392 they are going for womens bags in dark colored leather
5859393 awarding three contracts will help to reduce the jltvs technical risks validate designs and cost estimates evaluate manufacturing processes and refine program requirements
5859394 desperate times call for desperate measures and thats what were seeing from gm
5859395 its not a new theme but on the other hand the track record of gms incentive programs has been very good
5859396 were diligently working on preparing our case and we will file by the end of next month
5859397 with the goal of working constructively and cooperatively with government at all levels and other concerned citizens and corporations to continue the remarkable growth of the internet and to promote innovation openness and freedom as the path to even greater benefit of this medium for all
5859398 the third circuit court does not publish who your three judge panel is until after you file your case then a schedule is set for oral arguments

5859400 top 10 gaining categories by percentage change in unique visitors u s
5859401 beijing the international olympic committee and nbc are betting viewers are going to fall in love with a sport that features big people riding little bikes bicycle motocross and it does resemble motorcycle racing without the motors in beijing they wont need motors because the cyclists will get all the speed they can handle from a scary starting drop down a 30 foot ramp into a series of dirt jumps bumps berms and gaps summer games its an attempt to catch some of the excitement snowboarding has brought to the winter games
5859402 racers have eight riders on the course together all first having to navigate a 35 foot starting ramp that has such a severe slope more than one rider has gotten to the platform overlooking it and become so gripped with fear that they burst into tears
5859403 but were not a bunch of punk kids riding around town vandalizing stuff
5859404 i like to sing and dance thats who i am thats my personality
5859405 so what about the bmx well sorry guys but its a kids bike it was designed to appeal to the 10 to 13 age bracket it is proportioned to the smaller body in fact the bmx is a good kids bike safe efficient and adaptable unlike its short lived predecessor the fatuous chopper machine but theres something ridiculous almost pathetic in the spectacle of a grown man often a superb athlete perched on his silly toy and performing circus tricks in a purpose built arena supposedly in the name of sport come on lads if you think you can cycle buy a proper bike and lets see if you can hack it with the big boys in the alps or pyrenees
5859406 happy 10th birthday to the mp3 player you have come a long way baby
5859407 the object of my school is to is to show how many extraordinary things even a lazy and ordinary man may see if he can spur himself to the single activity of seeing
5859408 if an emergency affecting the availability of our primary bull run source occurs the water bureau has a responsibility to ensure that we have a fully functioning back up supply to supply our customers with water
5859409 el actual momento econ mico ha afectado a nuestras tiendas
5859410 no hay marcha atr s a medida que nuestros derechos avanzan como parte de una cruzada mucho mayor por los derechos humanos en el mundo occidental
5859411 integridad territorial de georgia dentro de sus fornteras reconocidas internacionalmente
5859412 no hay ninguna raz n para la que las tropas rusas permanezcan todav a en georgia
5859413 la retirada de las fuerzas rusas ha comenzado aunque hay que esperar varios d as para realizar el plan de paz de seis puntos
5859414 itll probably make me hungry for red lipstick and orange grease
5859415 yeah definitely all the players here are trying to make an impression all i can do is give 100 percent and try and get back in the squad
5859416 it is not a problem for me being back in the under 21s i will just give 100 percent for the under 21s and hopefully it will be enough to get back into the squad
5859417 we have got a good squad of lads here and it is not just me who can move up you know there is james milner and i dont want to mention names but there is loads of us that can move up and hopefully we can do
5859418 if you asked me what i was looking for going into the game obviously a clean sheet obviously a few goals and a good performance
5859419 i got bits and pieces of everything and not everything that i was looking for to be honest with you
5859420 but we will go away and look at it again when we meet with the coaches but it has certainly stood us in good stead that is for sure going into the portugal game at wembley
5859421 it was a mixed bag really i know we can certainly play better than that you should never underestimate winning certainly at international level as well so that is a positive to take from it
5859422 we had maybe five or six that competed for their clubs on sunday so obviously we were aware of that situation and maybe one or two tonight had not featured for their clubs this season yet
5859423 but we can pass the ball better and we can play better than that but every step at this age group is a learning curve for the players
5859424 i actually try to get serena to stand up for herself a little bit more
5859425 many aspects of this disease and its transmission remain an enigma
5859426 i am not in favor of the amethyst initiative even though a number of other nationally known colleges and universities have chosen to endorse it
5859427 from my three decades of experience as vice president of student affairs and as president of two colleges my belief is that advocating state legislatures to change the laws is not a responsible position for the college to take
5859428 although i have not signed the amethyst initiative statement i believe the issues raised by the signers merit serious examination
5859429 its an issue that affects more than college students we allow an 18 year olds to vote and serve in the military i certainly support an open and public discussion of the proposal
5859430 the cuts have to be there as far as im concerned nothings off the table
5859431 doing that in the middle of a fiscal year when theyve already made decisions on staffing and programs i think wouldve been unfair
5859432 id like to see 6 hundred million because we do need to get to the governors goal but 4 hundred million is better than where we started this morning but we need to do a little more work
5859433 i think it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean windfarm
5859434 some want a cap and trade system which is like taking three right turns instead of one left
5859435 and theyll also require cost effective retrofits of our existing larger buildings
5859436 we came out just in time to be in your shot
5859437 we like to think the lord leads us to our next place the lord led me here
5859438 they say he criticized the caste system which he didnt even though i think the caste system is the most horrible thing in the world
5859439 where hindus have killed christian priests its like they want to eliminate christianity
5859440 brings widespread attention to the obesity and chronic disease disparities in southern l a
5859441 we are surrounded by a smorgasbord of highly palatable pervasively marketed inexpensive readily accessible nutrient poor but energy dense foods
5859442 coupled with seductive sedentary entertainment and transportation options and re engineering of the built environment to favor automobile transportation over pedestrian or mass transit our genetic hard wiring to avoid exercise and eat salty sweet and fatty foods easily explains the occurrence of the small caloric excesses and energy expenditure deficits necessary to produce the epidemic
5859443 cheap corn transformed into high fructose corn syrup is what allowed coca cola to move from the svelte 8 ounce bottle of soda ubiquitous in the 70s to the chubby 20 ounce bottle of today cheap corn transformed into cheap beef is what allowed mcdonalds to supersize its burgers and still sell many of them for no more than a dollar cheap corn gave us a whole raft of new highly processed foods including the world beating chicken nugget which if you study its ingredients you discover is really a most ingenious transubstantiation of corn from the cornfed chicken it contains to the bulking and binding agents that hold it together
5859444 until we somehow deal with this surfeit of calories coming off the farm it is unlikely that even the most well intentioned food companies or public health campaigns will have much success changing the way we eat
5859445 citizens can become involved with grassroots advocacy groups to chip away at the food industrys hold on our politicians and locales much as they pecked big tobacco to death initially with smoking bans and restrictions gradually changing social norms and building political will
5859446 as addressing the paucity of options rather than controlling people
5859447 i have received around two thousand cards from local residents and presented many petitions over the years in the house of commons
5859448 i now hope these people will display my campaign poster in their windows to show support for our community and particularly vulnerable people who often depend heavily on their local office
5859449 these guys work hard there are always and will always be areas to improve but every lineman we have is fighting everyday to improve
5859450 confidence is not only built through success in games but through knowing that you have prepared the best you can
5859451 we are bigger and stronger this year but i think we are also quicker so we can do both
5859452 i guess it just my new york attitude that makes me think that i am nasty and a little crazy i dont really see it its just the way i am

5859457 el uso de la m scara por el zorro para ocultar su identidad como don diego me dio la idea de darle a batman una identidad secreta bruce wayne ser a un hombre rico con una fachada decadente el zorro montaba un caballo negro llamado tornado y entraba en una cueva y sal a por el sal n a trav s del reloj de su abuelo la bat cueva se inspir en la de el zorro no quer a a batman como un superh roe con superpoderes as que le hice como un ser humano ordinario s lo era un atleta que ten a la fortaleza f sica de douglas fairbanks sr que era mi h roe favorito de todos los tiempos del cine
5859458 each tyranid is a living weapon perfectly adapted to its designated function but each creature is no more than a single cell in a galactic entity governed by a monstrous hive mind as the tyranid hive fleets drift through space they strip all life from the worlds in their path leaving nothing but scoured rock in their wake in the war zones of warhammer 40 000 the tyranids are instinctive masters of swarm tactics and close combat frequently appearing by the thousands across untold numbers of world they always outnumber their opponents a fact that often guarantees their victory each tyranid is equipped with diamond hard rending claws razor sharp teeth and a variety of other bio weapons suited to both close quarters fighting and ranged attacks whats even more fearsome are the monstrous creatures striding through a tyranid swarm like carnifexes and hive tyrants true behemoths who tower over even the largest of tanks and mechanised units in total the tyranids are a cold and brutal opponent to face even the best warriors in the galaxy can only hope to stall the tyranids advance

5859463 there is no evidence of grade inflation which doesnt of course mean that it doesnt exist and that the reasons for thinking it would be bad if it did exist are pretty weak
5859464 mtv gives britney another chance at the video music awards this year britney will have a public performance singing a new track from her new album
5859465 way bigger fish to fry little mama than me about a couple songs
5859466 i cant have animosity with someone i dont know i tried to call her call her people i called everybody they didnt want to return a phone call so i said alright well i guess ill take these songs that were written for britney and give them to other people time is money
5859467 straight up and down i thought our collaboration was gonna suck
5859468 one that i didnt think she was going to be able to pull off i had to eat my words miss lindsay lohan i apologize if youre watching i am sorry there we go
5859469 but i think a comeback is possible shes got to remind people why they loved her in the first place and get peoples minds off her personal life and back on the music
5859470 hey would a birthday cake have rose petals around it i don t think so wedding cake all the way
5859471 the vision is to take a non contributing property with no commerce whatsoever smack in the middle of the corridor and make the building vibrant transforming blight to bright
5859472 ive always had an interest in downtown pittsburgh its been a dream of mine i thought id never be able to touch anything there
5859473 we just wanted to be with these people so we decided to pick a city and move to it
5859474 you immediately start feeling this homeness to it because youre recognized you go to chicago you go to new york you go to portland youre not needed there there are tons of people there it doesnt matter if you live there or not but pittsburgh if you live here you add to the population in a significant way
5859475 i think we had this connection with each other because everyone was interested in social justice and how that should play out in everyday life
5859476 its kind of rare to have this many people who arent committed to any place but were committed to each other and to living this out and so we said if we just disperse were probably never going to find this again so lets try to keep it together
5859477 have too much of 20 somethings who listen to indie music and drink coffee
5859478 we all live there because its dense walkable and community oriented but a daytime meeting place was missing beleza is open generous hours and has made the walkable community aspect of the neighborhood complete its also acted as a catalyst to get other people interested in the mexican war streets
5859479 weve made a decision in this business that none of us has the final say we chose that together
5859480 in some ways its challenging but we obviously trust each other
5859481 the ou initiative is the only major u s initiative of its kind devoted to the problem of biodeterioration and biocorrosion
5859482 first we have to understand how mother nature cleans up these spills and we can do this by studying the way microorganisms interact with hydrocarbons
5859483 we want to better understand how organisms eat through these pipelines several fundamental mechanisms cause this problem but it is spotty and doesnt occur all of a sudden rather biocorrosion occurs over a long period of time and we are using a series of new molecular and chemical tools to find out why and how this happens
5859484 we think cells grow in communities that adhere to the inner surface of pipelines and form three dimensional biofilms that can sometimes cause pitting once we understand what these microorganisms are doing we can interrupt their processes or diagnose them more effectively the science is rudimentary at this stage the modern tools of molecular microbiology have not been applied yet but a national science foundation grant support from the does joint genome institute and the cooperation of the energy industry allowed us to study pipeline biocorrosion on the north slope
5859485 for many years no one ever thought anaerobes could grow by metabolizing hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen but that is simply wrong the organisms are actually quite good at it the underlying mechanisms will be even more important as we introduce newer biofuels to augment our fossil fuel supply we are putting new fuel combinations into the existing pipelines that service the entire country the new biofuels can be less stable so there is a different problem to deal with the chemistry of biofuels may not allow us to store them as long and more research is needed to determine the stability compatability and composition of such fuel mixtures
5859486 because two thirds of u s oil is still in place we can use these organisms to convert residual hydrocarbons into natural gas and create a new source of domestic energy the concept of anaerobic metabolism is an innovative process and the ou initiative is the only one of its kind in the united states at the present time we are also experimenting with shales and other unconventional reservoirs
5859487 biotechnology can influence recovery and address some of todays problems if we can understand how microorganisms degrade hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen ou is one of the top universities in the world to study anaerobic microbiology with 14 experts performing research in some aspect of this field it is rare for universities to have even a single individual with this specialization ou is an exciting place to be if you are an environmental microbiologist this initiative has unified this group of experts and led to the groundbreaking research we have just begun to understand
5859488 we know that bacterial cells communicate much like those that cause disease if we know the language they use we can send signals and interrupt their communications so they will change their behavior the best way to treat the biocorrosion problem has not yet been determined active ongoing monitoring of pipelines tells us there is an ongoing process but we need to get to the problem before it gets to the critical stage some and perhaps most microorganisms are not routinely monitored so we have to understand the role they play in this process information we can use to more effectively diagnose and treat the consequences
5859489 instead of needing relaxation measurements that require using neutron scattering a national facility with limited time availability we have developed a widely accessible solution in the form of readily available steady state fluorescence measurements
5859490 this will allow pharmaceutical companies to adopt the new metrology weve developed
5859491 initial tests have shown that network load could be reduced by a factor of five or more without compromising network performance
5859492 at the same time speeds are increased by about 20 percent
5859493 we think we have one of the most extensible rigorous architectures for making these applications run more efficiently
5859494 the project seems to have a momentum of its own
5859495 we realized that p2p networks were not taking advantage of the flexibility that exists
5859496 typically when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy individuals to determine cognitive impairment
5859497 however this approach does not take into account intra individual variability in cognitive function
5859498 we know that level of performance on tests of memory attention and executive function predicts dementia however this study showed for the first time that the degree of variability in performance across neuropsychological tests measured within a person improved the prediction of dementia above and beyond ones level of performance on each test alone
5859499 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period which on average was 3 3 years
5859500 this figure is in line with what wed expect for the incidence of dementia in this population
5859501 we sometimes get as much as 80 percent of registered voters even in primaries but im not sure well do that today
5859502 we left a package on the table that included a new firefighter a 4 percent raise additional training money a degree incentive and more
5859503 tina calls up and talks to individual council members what do you think about this what do you think about that tina spent a lot of time on the phone and in person with council members she fought hard to get additional money
5859504 i dont think youve heard lawsuit from this side of the table in a long time
5859505 the citys financial situation is poor this is not about the lawsuit this is about the citys basic lack of money
5859506 we will work with fire and city administration to accomplish all our goals
5859507 there are also a number of issues from promotional procedure to training in inclement weather
5859508 this is an interesting day but im honestly more interested in the way the other elections turn out
5859509 its not a matter of issues its a matter of dollars
5859510 the system is faulty and listing items they dont have
5859511 the chance that you get this laptop is the same chance that michael phelps wins another gold medal
5859512 what were trying to do is reach out to the business owners and say hey is there different forms or different opportunities we can bring you in where you can meet some of our residents
5859513 pardon me waiter there appears to be a 9 foot tapeworm in my salmon salad
5859514 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
5859515 i almost didnt go out with him because he was so young but he was always trying to convince me he was so mature and he was its true my friends made fun of me and gave me the nickname stella from the movie how stella got her grove back about a woman who dates this younger guy but one of the reasons we got along was because we both loved hip hop and used to talk about the black eyed peas and how amazing they were
5859516 yes i get it black people were slaves here once you know what that does suck some major balls however it is time to move the fuck on
5859517 do we hear the jews crying that they were made slaves for thousands of years do we hear them whine that they should own the pyramids in egypt because they broke their backs making them do we hear them bitch and moan about hitler etc my hubby is a jew nope we dont
5859518 if any other race had a chanel dedicated to just them we would think it was racist if any other race demanded a month be set aside for only them they would be considered racist
5859519 i will no longer tune into bet this is going to suck but i do not like the idea of having a chanel for only 1 race in the year 2007 in a country that is supposed to be the most advanced and equal this is unexceptable i will also no longer acknowledge black history month
5859520 at first i thought id have pants underwear on for the scene apparently not
5859521 but ive sort of done that before on stage it s all old hat now really

5859541 i dont think anyone wants to go after a saxophone player
5859542 grabbing some jazz musicians really isnt going to do anything
5859543 i remember i was a 20 year old kid going to these places going to these restaurants hanging out and arguing about communism versus democracy
5859544 it was one of the best times of my life
5859545 swing university offers insights and expertise shared by jazz scholars and historians who have witnessed the history first hand plus the rare opportunity to learn about jazz from the musicians themselves
5859546 i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible
5859547 ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
5859548 are a crucial step forward and should help clamp down on sex tourism
5859549 we have been consistently saying that when there is clear evidence a sex offender poses a risk the authorities must have effective powers to stop them from going abroad
5859550 but if they do travel there must be better systems in place to monitor and track their movements
5859551 high security prisons require constant and vigorous management in order safely to contain and work effectively with their challenging populations
5859552 franklands population had become even more challenging recently with increases in gang affiliations and the arrival of a small number of convicted terrorists
5859553 it is unfortunate that this coincided with the absence of the governor for some months and the resulting drift that was observable at this inspection needs urgently to be reversed
5859554 as the population has an increasing number of black and minority ethnic prisoners bme and an increasing proportion of muslim prisoners it is vital there is more bme recruitment and that all staff receive training in diversity issues
5859555 this will empower staff so that they are able to sensibly confront problem behaviour when necessary while also going a long way to improving relationships within the jail
5859556 it needs to rectify the shortcomings highlighted in this report and make sure everyone in frankland is in a safe environment
5859557 i am concerned about the comments on safety however this should be seen in the context of franklands extremely challenging population
5859558 a new diversity and safer prisons manager is now in post to ensure a focus on the matters raised in relation to anti bullying and diversity
5859559 lessons in the alexander technique offer an individualised approach to develop skills that help people recognise understand and avoid poor habits affecting postural tone and neuromuscular coordination
5859560 it can potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
5859561 there is little evidence available about the effectiveness of the alexander technique so this research is welcome
5859562 the alexander technique is something we do recommend and the feedback we have got is good
5859563 there are no frosty relations at all within the government im working closely with the prime minister on this issue just yesterday we were talking about the next steps hes been making a major contribution at head of government level

5859565 by early october the building should be enclosed and interior work will start on the theater and event and exhibit spaces people will be able to see how quickly the structure is taking shape
5859566 its been a lot of work and a milestone for the organization
5859567 we went from three exam rooms to an eight exam room shared practice with internal medicine it meets a number of needs
5859568 the great news is we can now offer high level care and services to the whole family it allows us to see more patients and decrease wait times
5859569 we wanted to expand our services because the need in turtle creek is dramatic its an under served community with a high concentration of asthma in children
5859570 we were in a very small space and needed to upgrade
5859571 we love the strip district its a neat concept and a great location for bringing downtown back to the strip everyones raved about the food so far
5859572 the fa ades will be designed to emulate the architectural fabric of the area
5859573 its a national company with an office located within pittsburgh thats relocating and growing
5859574 its good start now that the fa ade is coming together and the lighting and parking lot are in momentum will pick up pretty significantly over the next several quarters
5859575 weve always identified pittsburgh as a marketplace we wanted to grow into we have options to acquire additional square footage weve made a long term commitment to the tower
5859576 were trying to develop and strengthen urban areas which is certainly a high priority for the city and region our location puts in a position to play a key role in those types of initiatives
5859577 our urban core benefits when new companies such as traffic planning and design inc make the decision to locate downtown
5859578 were happy to have them as neighbors in the regional enterprise tower a downtown office hub for many companies and organizations dedicated to regional improvement and investment
5859579 we have several staff members from the pittsburgh area who had a long term goal of moving back into the region
5859580 we have always known that heedless self interest was bad morals we know now that it is bad economics
5859581 a lie is a very poor way to say hello
5859582 actually we condemning the arrest of abdi aziiz and this is unfortunately tragedy faced like our colleague abdi aziiz salaad ahmed and all puntland journalists as well as
5859583 said daud abdi daud sojras secretary general we also demand unconditional release of abdi aziiz salaad ahmed he added
5859584 they can never get their paperwork together in time and then

5859586 based on user reports collected so far the iphone 2 0 2 software update does not address 3g issues however as we dont have detailed release notes from apple its unclear as to what 2 0 2 specifically addresses
5859587 so far i am pleased with this update on screen keyboard responsiveness and contacts performance seem improved
5859588 the iphone 2 0 2 software update improves communication with 3g networks
5859589 i never noticed any iphone specific connectivity issues to begin with
5859590 by no means am i saying that the iphone 3g is perfect
5859591 i have also experienced random slowness and or crashing with every build of the software including the 2 0 2 update i have also had serious qualms with the iphone 3gs battery life the 2 0 2 firmware hasnt been out long enough for me to know if battery life is any better with it
5859592 im sure that there are some people who arent happy with their iphone 3gs maybe they have defective units maybe they have poor at amp t coverage in their areas or the network is overloaded
5859593 because this is brand specific and there have been no recalls that information can only be had through a foia freedom of information act request
5859594 it is very difficult to positively determine how many counterfeit batteries have started fires
5859595 in fiscal year 2007 customs seized us 200 billion dollars worth of counterfeit goods by midyear 2008 shipments seized had risen 28 percent over the same time period last year
5859596 its been demonstrated that having viral videos to get people involved in things that were traditionally thought of as wonky inside the beltway issues turned out to be very effective
5859597 the people who are online looking at these videos and issues are more politically aware they follow the blogs and are much more likely to take part in online petitions or send e mails to their congressman the people who are online get wifi on steroids it will get them their online videos faster or in the first place
5859598 we just hope that the commission reviews its testing procedures and realizes whats at stake here is the ability of 110 million american households to watch clear tv pictures i dont think americans are going to tolerate their tv screens freezing up just to keep microsoft and google happy
5859599 not everyone in the archives is running vista but out of the sample set of vista capable population and those that shipped with vista in the less than 1 000 pc range what were seeing is two thirds of those systems still have vista installed one third of them have been modified to run xp at this date
5859600 we have a community of mostly enterprise customers our original product platform hails out of our work with the financial services industry our tools are installed throughout many wall street firms and the larger ones have been using it to monitor workstations for several years
5859601 we have a pretty accurate snapshot of whats going on with these machines at a given time
5859602 it was just simple comparison if the machine previously had one of the vista flavors it is a clear example of a machine that has been downgraded directly by the end user or by their it organization in a larger firm or a request to the manufacturer to exercise their downgrade option
5859603 over 180 million windows vista licenses have been sold since launch
5859604 pretty diverse with a lot of large firms and is international in its scope
5859605 what were seeing is fairly representative of the enterprise space
5859606 the user feedback and customer feedback that has been reported over the last year or so is that large organizations are bypassing vista or delaying its adoption or debating whether to stick with windows xp consumers will take anything that ships with their systems where we see resistance to vista is in the bread and butter enterprise data center managed and controlled environments of corporate america and the world

5859609 this is a good move for intel and its good for customers that intel is making the move
5859610 it will speed development of solid state drive ssd technology and drop the cost smaller pc manufacturers will be able to buy pre integrated ssd drives that will seamlessly slide right into current laptop and desktop designs which means no additional redesign or development cost
5859611 on the plus side they are faster smaller and can take less power they arent mechanical and are thus more reliable than regular hard drives
5859612 the downside is that currently they are more expensive over time the price of ssds will come down but i believe most users will eventually have systems that utilize both ssds and traditional hard drives a decent sized ssd will give a speed boost while the regular hard drive will store the bulk of the data
5859613 technology is a tool to address some of the worlds most pressing challenges related to health care education economic development and the environment
5859614 no nations or individuals are untouched by these issues get involved be part of the solution
5859615 it was a thoughtful piece focusing on what technology can do rather than focusing on 45 nanometer technology
5859616 intel will have plenty of opportunity to talk about products and technology he was trying to raise the level over individual products
5859617 it was certainly crafted to hit some hot button issues
5859618 this is part of a larger recognition and effort by large it vendors that they need to do more to encourage innovation around the world
5859619 thats just what i want its why im here and trying to help
5859620 i think werder have improved in many aspects and above all this team is real quality

5859647 as an individual and as a party we have always hoped and prayed for his speedy recovery sadly he has left us at this most trying time
5859648 vous simplement parlez what you knower in francais et fait tout else in anglais
5859649 i wish i had woken up but i know he was here
5859650 he has always wanted to give back and make people happy and make them give them a little piece of him a piece of his heart because he has a great heart
5859651 it takes courage to embrace a family in that position he did it
5859652 it wasnt to better his image in the community or in the world
5859653 just clutched the balloons smiled and went back to sleep
5859654 stevie came over and said wow you came and at a full run he leaped into michaels arms

5859659 stevie it was great to see you last night im really glad i got to visit you are very brave you really are an inspiration to us all talk to you soon michael
5859660 it never went out in the press that he was here never
5859661 no one ever knew the depth of the relationship between them
5859662 when he passed away when we went to the funeral it was hard it was an honor for me to have someone like him look up to me
5859663 im sure hes looking down on us and im sure hes cheering from above

5859665 im taking lara to a new level you could say my mission is to become the real life lara croft i would like to think i am the best one yet angelina might disagree though ideally i would love to do a film that would be absolutely amazing angelina is great but if she cant do it im more than ready to step into those boots for her
5859666 im not scared of becoming a sex symbol or the thought of getting lots of male attention but lara doesnt really have any time for men and it seems im also going to be too busy from now on it doesnt really matter as most men cant keep up with me anyway

5859681 when the police came with the maritime security they beat him up
5859682 the released suspects told us that bukenya had been seriously tortured they were only released on bond when the police realised that the suspect was dead
5859683 we were shocked to recover bukenyas naked body on sunday morning floating on the lake
5859684 this was a mistake we apologise and assure you it will not happen again the police cannot work without you and we request you to continue working with us burning the police post came out of anger but you should also desist from doing it again

5859692 sometimes i cry sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of healing
5859693 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5859694 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5859695 oh my god i was so pissed off so mad i was just shaking
5859696 immediately i had to go into take care of business mode
5859697 i watched her have a mastectomy and then i watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hysterectomy
5859698 ive watched this woman survive both of those things so for me there was always that sense that i was going to be okay no matter what
5859699 besides me being really vigilant about it mammograms and self examinations it is the no 1 reason i am going to live

5859714 today parts of anniston are so contaminated that residents have been told not to grow vegetables in the soil kick up dirt eat food chew gum or smoke cigarettes while working in their yards

5859716 show that for decades the corporate giant concealed what it did and what it knew
5859717 is nothing but a fancy word for wont go away

5859730 this is a comedy about making movies its not a war comedy
5859731 the movies that were satirizing like platoon deer hunter full metal jacket all those movies i grew up watching and was very affected by this is a comedy that lives in its own place i think sometimes in times of war people want escapism too

5859737 gobolinux tries to replace the legacy layout instead of going the way of stacked layouts giving us yet another standard layout as if its underlying reasons were superior than fhs i think theyre not
5859738 fhss goal is to allow apps to find their files and other apps files and libraries in a portable way among unix systems its a functional layout aimed at portability and interoperability
5859739 one huge problem of the fhs is that it does not easily allow one to have multiple versions of a program installed this is what has lead to the whole so 1 2 3 mess as well
5859740 it is a reason why on a typical debian system one finds a new symlink called ruby under usr bin which points to a ruby1 8 symlink or vice versa if one compiles ruby from source he does not get any such arbitrary symlinks

5859829 thousands of cases of west nile virus have been reported worldwide but 80 of infected people dont show any symptoms
5859830 it is important to have highly sensitive and specific tests to diagnose infections and also to help track the ecology and epidemiology of west nile encephalitis
5859831 although the methods developed are for diagnosing west nile virus in horses the procedures can be easily modified to develop new antibody tests for humans and wildlife
5859832 it is essential to test wildlife for infection to determine the ecological and epidemiological aspects of west nile virus infections in nature so that we can try to control the disease by managing mosquito populations
5859833 massage is helpful in the short term but the alexander technique retained effectiveness at one year the results should apply to most patients with chronic or recurrent back pain
5859834 given the fragility of african agriculture and perpetual famine risks with millions of lives at stake msv is actually one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide
5859835 we wanted to learn more about how the virus emerged and spread so we can develop new ways to fight the diseases it causes
5859836 we found that the maize adapted virus infects a greater variety of grasses than any of the other msv strains
5859837 the virus appears to be spreading around africa faster than the other strains too when we compared the genomes of 11 different strains of msv we discovered that lots of genes had been exchanged between the strains in a process called recombination we also found that every msv that causes severe disease in maize has descended from an ancestral virus that was the recombinant offspring of two relatively harmless wild grass infecting viruses this chance recombination event could be the reason msv has become such a serious problem
5859838 understanding the chain of events that trigger the emergence of novel pathogens is a major goal of epidemiologists worldwide
5859839 there is a lot of circumstantial evidence suggesting how evolutionary processes like recombination might trigger the emergence of a pathogen but there are actually very few well documented examples of this having occurred
5859840 knowing that maize adapted msvs are unusually mobile i hope will prompt scientists to test msv resistance genes against the large bank of virus strains that we have catalogued from across africa

5859891 tutto annotato nellanima del mondo l dove rimarr per sempre
5859892 se quanto hai gi trovato fatto di materia pura non potr mai marcire e tu un giorno potrai tornare se stato soltanto un attimo di luce come lesplosine di una stella allora non troverai pi nulla quando ritornerai ma avrai visto unesplosione di luce e anche solo per questo ne sar valsa la pena

5859898 il tradimento il colpo che non ti aspetti e se tu saprai conoscere bene il tuo cuore esso non te lo dar mai perch conoscerai i tuoi sogni e i tuoi desideri e saprai fronteggiarli nessuno riesce a sfuggire al proprio cuore quindi meglio ascoltare ci che dice perch non si abbatta mai quel colpo che non ti aspetti
5859899 lo faccio perch sono il cuore di un uomo e i cuori degli uomini sono cos hanno paura di realizzare i sogni pi grandi perch pensano di non meritarlo o di non riuscire a raggiungerli noi i cuori siamo terrorizzati al solo pensiero di amori che sono finiti per sempre di momenti che avrebbero potuto essere belli e non lo sono stati di tesori che avrebbero potuto essere scoperti e sono rimasti per sempre nascosti nella sabbia perch quando ci accade noi ne soffriamo intensamente
5859900 digli che la paura di soffrire assai peggiore della stessa sofferenza e che nessun cuore ha mai provato sofferenza quando ha inseguito i propri sogni perch ogni momento di ricerca un momento di incontro con dio e con leternit
5859901 mentre cercavo il mio tesoro tutti i giorni erano giorni luminosi perch sapevo che ogni ora faceva parte del sogno da ritrovare
5859902 e presta sempre attenzione ai segnali ormai il tuo cuore in grado di mostrarti il tesoro

5859943 what can i add to that never forget that human life is the supreme good in this world never forget that human dignity is not an expendable commodity but belongs to everyone without exception
5859944 every day we are pro life every day we are champions of human dignity our voices and our votes should shape society by bringing these inalienable truths into every particular proposal and program every particular candidates projects and plans

5859951 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion
5859952 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5859953 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5859954 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5859955 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5859956 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5859957 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5859958 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5859959 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
5859960 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
5859961 to bear witness to our faith not only in private in our homes but also in our public lives with others in order to bear strong witness to christ
