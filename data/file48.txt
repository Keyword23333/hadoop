480000 that work taught me a fundamental truth that has guided me to this day that change doesnt come from the top down it comes from the bottom up
480001 im pleased to tell you that the entire plot is illuminated a big part of the perpetrators were arrested in the light of strong evidence that doesnt leave any room for doubt
480002 those who helped abetted and actively took part in the bombings were arrested
480003 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
480004 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence than thats something im open to
480005 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
480006 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
480007 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
480008 if we come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise where i have to accept some things that i dont like in order to get energy independence thats something i will have to consider
480009 if we can come up with a bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence than stet thats something im open to
480010 anyone foolish enough to believe this dudes promises should be hit with a stick on the head
480011 but it is not clear how far obamas endorsement will get the senate compromise
480012 the evidence is consistent with the idea that at least initially more robust enforcement caused the number of illegal immigrants to decline significantly
480013 some people seem to think illegals are so permanently anchored in the united states that there is no possibility of them leaving this suggests theyre not correct some significant share might respond to changing incentives and leave
480014 it tracks something that correlates with the number of illegal immigrants rather than the actual number of illegal immigrants and it assumes the correlation remains the same
480015 if the ratio between the number of less educated hispanic adults and the total number of illegal immigrants has changed then the trend could be very different
480016 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research
480017 they are manipulating the system by manipulating the definition of the word abortion
480018 its another example of this administrations disregard for science and medicine in how agencies make decisions
480019 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
480020 if you do not respond within seven days you will be made ineligible for the prize
480021 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall

480033 tactics for hunting down tasmanians included riding out on horseback to shoot them setting out steel traps to catch them and putting out poison flour where they might find and eat it sheperds cut off the penis and testicles of aboriginal men to watch the men run a few yards before dying at a hill christened mount victory settlers slaughtered 30 tasmanians and threw their bodies over a cliff one party of police killed 70 tasmanians and dashed out the childrens brains
480034 tasmanian women to logs and burning them with firebrands or forcing a woman to wear the head of her freshly murdered husband on a string around her neck

480044 from about six or seven in the morning until about 10 or 11 at night ive been running fans non stop in the houses
480045 during the summer we usually use two to two and a half times more electricity than normal
480046 each farmer is on a different production schedule so the farmers who are just getting baby chickens arent having this problem
480047 he said it helped but he still couldnt get the temperature where it needs to be
480048 it seems pretty obvious because we have had rising numbers since the promise announcement and our numbers had been declining almost each year before that

480067 a new bus service started recently connecting the main cities and airports of cyprus its hoped it will become popular with both visitors and residents
480068 we are pleased about the new bus services which are now operating this should help numbers of people who are going out and also visiting other towns
480069 in addition we are hoping for a new night bus service in paphos this will help in two ways people living or staying in peyia for example would be able to catch a bus and visit a restaurant for an evening without the added expense of a taxi fare
480070 we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices
480071 we do not tell providers how to manage their networks they might choose for instance to prioritize voice over ip calls in analyzing whether comcast violated federal policy when it blocked access to certain applications we conduct a fact specific inquiry into whether the management practice they used was reasonable based on many reasons including the arbitrary nature of the blocking the lack of relation to times of congestion or size of files and the manner in which they hid their conduct from their subscribers we conclude it was not
480072 we do not limit providers efforts to stop congestion we do say providers should disclose what they are doing to consumers
480073 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
480074 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
480075 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
480076 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
480077 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
480078 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up

480081 the sure thing is that president christofias does not give out the message of the just and fair society that he was promising before the presidential elections
480082 without knowing all the details i am against granting any form of clemency because no one is above the law
480083 as a matter of principle all people are equal before the law
480084 if it is judged that someone should be granted clemency the reasons behind this form of pardon should be known so it does not upset the citizens because they have a right to know
480085 i am sure that if the president granted his pardon it is for important reasons
480086 i will not judge president christofias decision for pardoning the young lawyer but i would like to point out that some people in society such as lawyers mps and doctors have to be an example of upholding the law and of proper social behaviour
480087 i do not personally know the circumstances under which the pardon was granted or the reasons as to why it was suggested but if it was granted under no significant grounds it is unjustifiable and no one can be above the law everyone should be equal before the law and since no explanations were given each citizen has the right to believe that because of her profession as lawyer that makes her more equal to the law

480116 by revoking my jerusalem id they have revoked all the rights i have in palestine as well as my sons
480117 there is an ongoing and widely documented policy of discrimination in planning and building land expropriation home demolition the whole issue of revoking residency
480118 we believe in a jewish majority in jerusalem as such it is the capital of the jewish nation
480119 the israelis tried to take jerusalem out of the political game by using all their power to change the situation and consolidate their rule over the city but they failed
480120 she was born there i dont see why she should change it
480121 just because we came under occupation does not mean they israelis have the right to expel people
480122 the most encouraging thing is she has been listened to
480123 i think theres a recognition she has a lot of supporters out there and they need to reach out as shes reaching out to him obama
480124 weve worked together and there are a number of clinton supporters on the platform committee itself
480125 there is no single focus at this point it is a multiple focus accident investigation

480127 those who helped abetted and actively took part in the bombings were arrested
480128 this is not about khrushchev or stalin its about the future of russia
480129 the reason these rumors persist is rooted in the fate of the country when reformers are considered to be weak and tyrants strong
480130 i dont think khrushchev is of any interest to todays russian government
480131 im convinced leonid was shot down and killed in the war and that he was neither a captive nor collaborator of the germans
480132 stalin asked him to stand up and get a hold of himself
480133 i have said everything in my book there is nothing to add
480134 nothing happens in russia without the support of the government

480136 i was very afraid to leave their family because i was happy i had a family and i kept holding on to them all the time trying not to lose them
480137 it was the family that raised me that rescued me i also didnt want to leave poland i thought it was the country that let me live
480138 but i was 15 years old i was incredibly scared of the bombs i was no hero
480139 i think of my mother often because she was the dearest person in my life it stays with you all the time what you go through you cant throw it out of your memory
480140 my husband is very religious and doesnt especially care for the jews
480141 anytime he tried to say something against the jews i would tell him you forget who i am
480142 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
480143 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
480144 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
480145 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
480146 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
480147 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
480148 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
480149 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
480150 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
480151 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
480152 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
480153 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us
480154 these olympics will perhaps hurt the feelings of other countries but it will be good for chinese
480155 we care less about human rights than other countries and more about sovereignty thats bound to create an awkward feeling among other countries
480156 i want to reassure people that national will not worsen the situation
480157 its clear we dont have a debt problem ratings agencies and market commentators say the same despite the current downturn we want to continue to lay the foundations for the next round of economic growth
480158 prudent debt financing is one tool we can use to get on with the job now to build infrastructure that will endure for decades
480159 national has confirmed they would borrow to cover the massive hole they will create in the public accounts if elected unless they are prepared to slash public services once again
480160 the national partys proposed economic programme for new zealand can be summed up in four words more borrowing from foreigners
480161 bill englishs attempt to justify his borrow and hope fiscal management by promising to borrow only for infrastructure is an insult to the intelligence of new zealanders

480174 as urbahns skull showed no sign of a fracture its unlikely he was knocked out before he was stabbed and the sprawled position in which his skeleton was found suggests his hands were not tied behind his back
480175 its the killer in front who gets covered with urbahns blood a killer who does not leave blood in the subaru because he leaves the scene in another car
480176 this left an unbloodied tamihere to drive heidi to tararu creek rd where he subsequently raped and killed her
480177 things went well until murray briefly left the room and i unexpectedly found myself alone with tamihere suddenly the warm smile wilted on his lips his eyes narrowed and he stared coldly at me it was as if a switch had tripped inside his head turning off the nice david and flicking on the nasty one he sat in silence staring at me until murray came back then the switch flicked back again and the good david was suddenly back i have often wondered if in those few moments tamihere dropped his guard and showed me the man who might have murdered the swedes
480178 he was a total loner it was his nature and his preference

480187 our bodies were not made to experience shock trauma and grief those things go against everything that keeps us healthy when it is at an extreme level that our body cannot process the mind stores the information and the energy it takes to store the information takes away from our being currently present to life

480251 the announcement sends a strong message that all governments are united in their determination to address the problems and challenges posed by the contraband tobacco market governments are taking action so that no one will profit from evading canadas tax laws
480252 weve already pointed out that marc emery has harmed no one
480253 weve pointed out that harper has grown the govt faster than chretien
480254 weve pointed out that harper has stuck a knife into the oil patch
480255 the oil patch is an important part of the alberta economy but it should not be treated like a sacred cow maybe they should start contributing more to conservation
480256 debatable as far as the law is concerned hes a criminal so he has harmed society
480257 is that a bad thing governments have been growing steadily since 1900 the question ought to be is that growth unjustifiable
480258 the oil patch is an important part of the alberta economy but it should not be treated like a sacred cow maybe they should start contributing more to conservation
480259 no a socialist would seize their profits and nationalize them i lived through the one attempt to do that the nep never again

480261 answering a question about his approach to combatting crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us
480262 both prime ministers said we need to overcome these problems and move forward
480263 prime minister gilani said he would conduct an independent investigation into the kabul blast he will discuss the matter with afghan president hamid karzai and will look into the matter
480264 i am meeting president karzai tomorrow if they give me evidence then we will look into the matter
480265 the indian prime minister was relatively frank in expressing his views

480268 it is not possible for shohags family to send him to college though he has everyones blessings to continue his studies he has already applied to the government for financial assistance
480269 a popular hero turned victim of a government conspiracy making kamran the overwhelming favourite for tomorrows polls
480270 he is a great man everyone makes mistakes but he is in prison because some people are jealous of his popularity and love for the people of sylhet
480271 there is no doubt he is in jail because of a conspiracy while everyone is corrupt how come he alone is in jail and not others
480272 what can we do if people feel sympathy for kamran we have suffered much more under this government but he is the one in jail right now and not our candidate
480273 if a candidate wins this election from behind bars it would be a terrible shame for the caretaker government and their so called anti corruption drive how would we have any faith left in what the government has said if that happens
480274 following feuds inside bnp i hope to get many votes from bnp supporters as i expect many votes from conservative muslims my words against islamist militants could be wrongly interpreted by voters that is why it is better to avoid the issue
480275 during this election campaign voters made many queries but talking about militancy will not bring us any positive results rather it would impact negatively on our vote tally so it is better to keep silent about it
480276 i did not plan talking about militancy as none of my competitors raised the issue
480277 at this moment i do not want to talk about the issue as none of my competitors have raised it
480278 dreadful the militants may be but if mayor minu or other big political leaders had not helped bangla bhai and his cohorts they would never have dared to do such tortures so we want to hear their commitment against militancy prior to elections
480279 we want to be sure that the mayoral candidates will take actions against all those who were engaged with militancy
480280 there is no reason to remain silent as militants are still active they will come out whenever a suitable ground is found but we are helpless as the candidates are silent on the issue
480281 apart from taking legal actions the candidates must give us word that they will never allow the militant sympathisers in their parties or activities
480282 we want the candidates to promise that they would never provide shelters or funds to militants
480283 south asia is home to almost half of the worlds poor global economic slowdown soaring oil and food prices and growing threats of climate change are driving the destitute people of the region even further below the poverty line
480284 we have already agreed to move towards a south asian customs union and a south asian economic union in a planned and phased manner
480285 this is our common responsibility to the people of south asia
480286 together with other asian countries we should consider launching a greater asia food security programme
480287 it is important to remember the element of interdependence which is crucial for a durable peace and the protection of democratic values in the region
480288 these challenges do not just prevent the realisation of our potential for growth and prosperity they put our future gravely at risk
480289 it is time we focused together on fighting extremism and terrorism as the enemies we have in common
480290 global climate change policies are still driven more by eco rationale rather than all too important issue of human security
480291 millions continue to be mired in inhuman conditions of want and deprivation
480292 it is time we all realise that the pursuit of narrow geo political interest and the use of militant radicalism as instrument of policy cannot succeed or serve any long term purpose
480293 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of benazir bhutto
480294 gruesome reminders of the barbarity that still finds a place
480295 the curse of terrorism that threatens the peace and stability needed so much for the forward march of our people
480296 years ago my family could survive on what we grew we had the trees to supplement us we could sell one tree and that would see us through the year but now the trees are gone whatever is left does not bring us much money the land has lost its fertility so i moved on
480297 our timber supply has dwindled to half in the past five years or so
480298 and whatever timber we get is of little value as they are not mature enough to produce good quality wood
480299 unless we take immediate actions to provide alternative livelihood to the hills people the remaining forests would be gone very soon
480300 we need to plan how to use the forest in a sustainable way to provide jobs to the people
480301 the countries responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions should channel funds and technologies for the vulnerable and low lying countries like bangladesh to help them guard themselves against effects of climate change
480302 we should not consider what the developed nations want rather well have to speak of our needs at the london conference
480303 we must follow an action plan that will address our needs
480304 south asia is home to almost half of the worlds poor global economic slowdown soaring oil and food prices and growing threats of climate change are driving the destitute of the region even further below the poverty line
480305 we must redouble our efforts to attain the saarc development goals within the targeted timeline i believe national action on poverty alleviation should be complemented by effective and robust regional initiatives in order to have a penetrative impact on poverty reduction in south asia
480306 this requires our immediate attention to ensure constant and steady supply of food for our people
480307 this is a must to prevent hunger and malnutrition one of the key priorities of all nations and of the millennium development goals
480308 clearly there is a need to remove these hurdles to enhance intra regional trade
480309 we should strive to develop conventional as well as alternate sources of energy to ensure its steady supply at affordable cost
480310 achieving energy security is a must to realise development potential of the region
480311 terrorists have perpetrated brutal acts in every part of the world we condemn the heinous terrorist attacks in afghanistan india and pakistan in recent times which caused unnecessary loss of life and property
480312 i believe there is a clear political will and commitment to realise this goal bangladesh remains deeply committed to making this happen
480313 i try not to make a practice out of threatening bloggers with litigation id have more success swatting hornets
480314 apparently j todd foster of the bristol herald courier is in a bit of a snit over some commentary by swac girl on her blog the thing that concerns me his response to her was the immediate threat of a lawsuit
480315 the issue that matters for bloggers and editors more broadly is the absolute lunacy of fosters reaction to one of swac girls recent posts
480316 having worked in newspapers for many a year i know how journalists think of the jerks whose first reaction to a negative article is to threaten us with a lawsuit
480317 boy am i an idiot i keep having faith in my brethren and they keep letting me down
480318 one who or that which is greatly disliked or detested
480319 but theres a reason that frivolous lawsuits threats are anathema to people who care about the right to free speech
480320 for a journalist to use such a tactic as his first resort is a disgrace maybe swac girl is wrong maybe she or the blogger she was linking to owe mr foster a correction one thing absolutely is clear 1st amendment dependent newspaper journalist foster has acted without the judgment youd expect from a man with the responsibility of editing a newspaper
480321 the writing is on the wall for the bhc circulation is falling the bhc paper boxes that lined the roads for years are now disappearing and being replaced by kingsport times boxes the bhc will continue to lose local readership the reason is j todd foster with any luck the powers that be will get rid of him when they do circulation will again grow
480322 foster throws out a law suit would cost a blogger 200k to defend powerful threat indeed
480323 i dont know why foster decided to bring out the sledgehammer

480369 la constituci n es muy clara en relaci n a lo que es la ley habilitante mecanismo que tambi n establec a la carta magna de 19961 y que tienen todas las constituciones del mundo en cuanto la posibilidad para que el jefe de estado pueda legislar en materias de inter s nacional
480370 buscan poner en sinton a con el pa s algunas normativas que estaban ya obsoletas y lo nico que se hizo fue adaptarlas a la realidad actual del pa s
480371 hasta el ltimo segundo que falte para que se concluya ese tiempo es v lido para sancionar alguna ley
480372 se cumpli un 95 por ciento con la expectativa que se aspiraba con la ley habilitante y aspiramos que el pueblo de venezuela entienda la importancia de esta serie de decretos leyes que van a traer beneficios a todos los venezolanos

480391 first off if youre reading this youre part of the reason im deleting my myspace myspace is a place where people can intrude in on others people lifes where people spend the whole day looking at and reading others people profiles comments to get to know somebody because in real life they fail at communicating with the world around them and see the computer and this site as a easy way to do so people on here can act as fake as they want and its funny because you can see it in those that do for example how the fuck can somebody know this person went to this place when you dont even know the person at all how can you pretend to know this person youre talking about when in reality you havent even talked to this person at all once its funny to me when i catch my own friends doing this but sad at the same time because you notice it when it happens and can pretty much guarantee they got this info by reading somebody elses comments by reading something that wasnt intended for them in the first place people claim that they use myspace as an easy way to communicate to their friends or blah blah blah well for a lot of people its not its a way for them to get away from their boring ass life and intrude in on others its a place for you to talk to people in a way you cant when they are right next to you its a way for you to get to know somebody to see whats going on in peoples lifes because in real life meeting and communicating with people is your weakness

480480 as soon as he pulled out onto flamingo he started speeding doing eighty or better and driving recklessly i was driving our unmarked car and gene was in the passenger seat
480481 eventually we figured we had enough probable cause on the traffic violations to pull the car over and check out the driver by that time we were on mcleod near a new housing development called sunrise villas and the lincoln had slowed to the speed limit i put the red light on the dash and activated it for the guy to pull over the lincoln turned onto engresso the street running into the development went past an unmanned security booth and stopped several yards beyond i parked behind him got out of the car and approached the lincoln verbally identifying myself as a police officer and displaying my badge as i neared the other car it pulled away at slow speed stopping again a short distance away i got back in our car and followed angling the police car in and again getting out and approaching the lincoln this time gene got out and took up a position by our passenger door
480482 this time as i neared the lincoln the driver lowered his window i again identified myself and displayed my badge suddenly gene hollered watch out dave hes got a gun i returned to our car and took up a position behind the drivers door gene and i continued to yell at the guy that we were cops and to put down his gun he never said a word but instead of getting rid of the weapon he turned slightly in his seat opened his door and started to get out of the car the gun was still in his hand and aimed toward gene believing the guy was about to shoot gene and i opened fire
480483 there was a real firestorm over the bluestein shooting we were accused of murdering the guy planting a gun and all that stuff we ran a check on the gun bluestein had and traced it to his brother ronald the gun had been purchased in chicago that pretty much blew the planted gun charge out of the water we didnt release that information right away though we waited until the coroners inquest to make it public
480484 for quite a while after the bluestein shooting there had been a verbal battle in the press between the department and the bluestein lawyers there had also been several civil cases filed and i thought that was all that was going on then we got word that groover and smith are going to be killed
480485 i went berserk spilotro knew my goal was to put him in prison for the rest of his life id told him that more than once we were adversaries but there were certain rules we played by you didnt put contracts out on cops and even if tony didnt actually order the hits he damn sure knew about them nothing like that was done in las vegas without spilotros knowledge and approval
480486 i moved my family out of state for their protection
480487 cops were assigned to stay at my house we were waiting for those guys the alleged hit men when they hit town and checked in at the fremont hotel downtown they were under surveillance around the clock one of the people they met with was ron bluestein franks brother the supposed hit men were in vegas for about a week but only came near my place once they stopped a couple of blocks away then left the area i dont know what happened maybe they got cold feet we eventually confronted them and had a little chat they headed back to chicago almost immediately
480488 the da didnt like to use wiretaps and i had other issues with him besides
480489 when we met to discuss the matter he asked me why i didnt like him
480490 while the wiretap was running we made reports to the judge who had issued the warrant on the second day of the tap he told me that a high ranking member of the das office had called him and asked that the tap be shut down after our conversation the judge refused the request the next day a piece appeared in the las vegas sun stating that an informant told them about the bluestein wiretap when that article appeared bluesteins phone went dead besides metro the only other people who were aware of the tap were the das office and the judge
480491 aiuppa wasnt home when we arrived only his wife was there and she wouldnt let us in i told her it was very important that i talk with her husband i left her the phone number for our motel and asked her to make sure he called me
480492 our next visit was to the home of joseph joey the clown lombardo he wasnt home either but his wife invited us into the house and we talked for about ten minutes we left the same message with her as with mrs aiuppa from there we stopped at tony accardos but he was out too three stops and three misses
480493 when we got to dorfmans office i walked past the reception desk looking for him the secretary said i couldnt do that and i told her to watch me i guess it was quite an entrance
480494 anyway we got to see dorfman and explained the situation to him he said to go back to the motel and someone would be in touch
480495 tony i and another guy were sitting at a table outside the restaurant we knew the cops were watching us in fact we made gestures at them to make sure they knew theyd been detected it was a game that we played all the time

480643 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
480644 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
480645 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
480646 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
480647 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
480648 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
480649 the u s may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the u s has long denied
480650 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
480651 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
480652 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
480653 a u s plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the u s facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the u s government has assured us that no u s detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
480654 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
480655 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which u s intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
480656 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the u s and accepted implausible u s assurances at face value
480657 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its u s allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
480658 it is deplorable that previous u s assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of u s activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia

480673 i dont really like the fact our own stadium is 50 50 with fans from saskatchewan makin just as much noise as ours
480674 the players ran hard you can tell the difference between the guys who stayed here for the summer and the guys who are new
480675 he lost some body weight he and are in great shape and damon cromartie smith is running like a receiver
480676 it is putting all of our defensive backs in good position where theyre on the field running around and making plays its a more physical defense you get in the box more with the linebackers and have to learn how to fight off linemen but if youre fast you can beat them
480677 you know what i want to challenge that guy for best fox spot i think im better than him
480678 you can challenge him for his place of best fox

480681 i really feel loved when you you really helped me get through one thing about you that makes me proud is
480682 our generation has a willingness to live alone and independent
480683 and its time that the men should pay back the debts
480684 remember he will pay less if his parents are not convicted so what if they do not stay with him who cares to investigate
480685 partly this is due to social stereotypes which say that the mother should take care of the children and the father should be the bread winner but the truth is that a father who would like to take care of two small children would have very little possibility of finding an appropriate job and making a living economical factors play a big role but it is not just that it is the whole arrangement of the society where it is expected that the mother will keep the kids
480686 from the childrens point of view it is ideal that they do not lose contact with either parent i would be glad if i could say that joint custody is the best solution but it also has its problems if the children are spending alternately one week here and the next somewhere else then you could say that they have no real home for a child a home is not just their parents it is the whole place their toys their friends the house which give them a feeling of stability and safety
480687 i always ask people who are getting divorce counselling whether they are from a family where the parents divorced and very often it is so of course some divorcees grew up in families which were complete and happy so there is no rule to say that such a childs future is pre determined but i would say that children from divorced families have a more difficult start in life
480688 i just wanted to let you know you ruined my life and ill never forgive you and i hate you and youre a total floozy but i want you to know that theres always a chance for us

480696 what is interesting is that newcastle are still following skjelbred and are preparing to lodge a 4 5m bid for him if their bigger transfer targets slip out of their hands
480697 which is also why skjelbred is putting off signing a new deal with rosenborg he does not want to make things messy if newcastle or another club he might find interesting comes in for him before the end of the transfer window
480698 prison staff are genuinely worried for blake and amys management are happy because they feel she needs to move out of town

480708 a pound of marijuana goes for 4 000 if you can get away with it you can make a lot of money with very little effort
480709 its flabbergasting to see the amount of effort people will go through to grow marijuana in unique places
480710 weve found marijuana on steep inclines on united states forest service land where youd think a goat would have to plant it because of the steepness of the trail
480711 the majority of gardens we are finding now are commercial gardens
480712 possess up to two pounds of dried marijuana per qualified patient
480713 a qualified patient or primary caregiver may also maintain no more than six mature female plants or in the alternative up to 75 square feet of total garden canopy measured by the combined vegetative growth area so long as the grow is consistent with the patients recommendation
480714 a lot of people prefer to get high on marijuana as opposed to alcohol or harder drugs
480715 so they grow it to get high or just to sell it

480753 i dont really think about no 1 and at the moment i dont deserve it
480754 id be disappointed if a club put in a request not to play north melbourne on grounds relating to the jumper
480755 it would be against the spirit of what i would think would be a normal fixture request normally it would be a fixture request to play someone on easter monday or a friday night but i would be astounded if they put in a request to not play north melbourne as a home team
480756 i would consider that an over reaction and i would consider it unfortunate and i would hope they wouldnt do that
480757 one would think the afl would look at all the fixtures in a cool calm collected way and make a decision accordingly
480758 we did it for a variety of reasons one was to recognise the 75 and 77 premiership players that were at the game it also sent a message to our members that we pride our blue and white stripes more than anything else
480759 the players have responded too telling us they love the blue and white stripes
480760 it is a matter of some bemusement that the home club doesnt get to wear its home strip and is subject to the afls call on clash jumpers
480761 when i went back over the rules three months ago to my surprise i read that the afl has total control over who wears what and that the previous notion that the home team wore the home strip or had the right to had essentially been removed thats if it even existed

480783 by no means are we at the mercy of those who doubt or deny that jesus ever lived
480784 if we apply to the new testament as we should the same sort of criteria as we should apply to other ancient writings containing historical material we can no more reject jesus existence than we can reject the existence of a mass of pagan personages whose reality as historical figures is never questioned
480785 modern critical methods fail to support the christ myth theory
480786 have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger indeed very abundant evidence to the contrary
480787 nearly all commentators who mention the matter at all set aside doubts about jesus historicity as ridiculous
480788 the view that there was no historical jesus that his earthly existence is a fiction of earliest christianity is today almost universally rejected
480789 serious students of the new testament today regard the existence of jesus as an unassailable fact
480790 jesus is not linked with a recognizable historical situation in any document christian jewish or pagan that can be proved to have originated before about ad 100
480791 if these words were really written by paul then it looks as though he was aware that jesus chose twelve disciples and if paul in this respect corroborates what the gospels say then it would be reasonable to infer that he also knows the principle facts of jesus life
480792 we can now be as certain as historical research will presently allow that josephus did refer to jesus
480793 many solid arguments can be presented against such distortions and polemics

480825 ho gi scritto personalmente al papa una lettera ed ora tramite voi giornalisti rilancio linvito al santo padre a visitare il nostro paese tutti ne saremmo veramente felici confessa il gran mufti un suo viaggio sui luoghi dove visse ed oper s paolo potrebbe contribuire a portare il fiore della pace in medio oriente
480826 scrissi subito al santo padre per avere chiarimenti dopo le parole prounciate a ratisbona e lui mi ha risposto chiarendomi il vero senso dellintervento rivela il gran mufti ai giornalisti italiani ricevuti nella sua sede di damasco in realt il suo discorso era una lezione accademica ed invece stato presentato come un attacco allislam

480831 so you have to put it in that political context
480832 and at the moment i really think it is falling short
480833 the issue is whether the final eis will be significantly improved and address those issues
480834 it is no surprise that after witnessing the citizen opposition at the public meeting in granville county that doug berger checked the political breeze and flip flopped on his longstanding but misguided support of the national bio and agro defense facility nbaf
480835 what is surprising is the gall in his statement that he has to provide leadership on the issue on this issue doug berger has shown us following and pandering not leading
480836 doug berger enthusiastically endorsed and supported the nbaf he bragged about the bipartisanship of his position in that he sided with notable statewide and federal republicans
480837 if anyone was showing leadership on this issue it was me i stood in opposition to the nbaf very early in the debate

480840 exercise is extremely important as powerful a medicine as any of the pills i prescribe
480841 exercise is natural its something we used to do all the time when we didnt have a sedentary lifestyle because of all our modern technological advances its something we need to get back to along with eating well
480842 silver sneakers more or less opened up the door to seniors who were never health club users
480843 all of a sudden senior membership has grown steadily over the last three years with specific classes geared toward seniors
480844 you really need to keep on top of what people are able to do
480845 were working not just muscle groups but balance and cardio and postural endurance were always looking for good posture
480846 this program prepares them to be safe and independent in their livelihood as long as possible
480847 for this group of people its about getting back into the game of life more than anything
480848 loss of muscle mass and strength oftentimes limits what people can do
480849 i love the silver sneakers program the vast majority of seniors who are not physically active become isolated with age silver sneakers gives them a chance to do something they would not do on their own with people similar to themselves
480850 no one expects to live forever but staying physically active prolongs the years of productivity and offers the highest possible quality of life
480851 the logic behind the program not only gives seniors access to exercise facilities here but as they travel throughout the country our snowbirds move comfortably from one facility to another
480852 it can help reduce high blood pressure which many of my patients have
480853 anything i can do to help remedy problems without medication is a good thing your body produces its own narcotics its endorphins even chronic arthritic pain can improve through regular exercise
480854 it was so easy you can do as much or as little as you like theres always a challenge a lot of the people in class are not able to do as much as some of us are
480855 yesterday we went to artpark there were 20 of us this is a great way to spend your senior years exercise is very important at every age but when you get older you need to keep limber
480856 everybody would like to lose weight of course they would but im not really here for that i want to keep that cholesterol down
480857 muscles help support the joints and if your muscles are weak its just bone on bone supporting your joints
480858 so if you can strengthen your muscles you also will improve your arthritic symptoms and help prevent their progression
480859 i have a lot of patients who come in complaining that theyre tired all the time
480860 i do the blood tests look into their medications and really cant find a specific reason oftentimes these patients are overweight not morbidly obese but carrying more weight than they should be they dont exercise
480861 i did the therapy and now im back with silver sneakers it just makes my whole body feel great every teacher gives a different routine that uses all the muscles in the body its a great workout
480862 when i had my knee surgery i got a card from everybody in this class

480873 reverend wrights offensive opinions and inflammatory appearances are judged differently than john hagee pat robertson and billy graham
480874 someone clearly invented false stories about the anthrax investigation and fed them to brian ross knowing he would run all over abc news programs heaping blame on saddam for those attacks in fact ross said that there were at least
480875 anthrax suspects death is dark end for a family man
480876 he had bought a bulletproof vest and a gun as he contemplated killing his co workers at the nearby army research laboratory
480877 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
480878 the anthrax in the tainted letter sent to senate majority leader tom daschle was laced with bentonite
480879 a troubling chemical additive that authorities consider their first significant clue yet
480880 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
480881 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
480882 the anthrax found in a letter to senator daschle is nearly identical to samples they recovered in iraq in 1994
480883 the anthrax spores found in the letter to senator daschle are almost identical in appearance to those they recovered in iraq in 1994 when viewed under an electron microscope
480884 the anthrax found in a letter to senator daschle is nearly identical to samples they recovered in iraq in 1994
480885 abc news has learned that the anthrax in the letter mailed to the senate contained an additive called bentonite
480886 im not sure if panic is quite the right word but it is close enough anthrax played a role in my decision to support the bush administrations desire to take out saddam hussein i linked him to anthrax which i linked to sept 11 i was not going to stand by and simply wait for another attack more attacks i was going to go to the source hussein and get him before he could get us as time went on i became more and more questioning but i had a hard time backing down from my initial whoop and holler for war really just contemplate that for a moment one of the countrys leading political pundits writing in some of the most influential opinion making space in this country supported an invasion of iraq because he believed that saddam hussein was connected to both the anthrax attacks and by implication the 9 11 attacks
480887 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
480888 there is also tremendous evidence that subsequent anthrax attacks are connected to iraq
480889 the iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade
480890 the anthrax spores found in the letter to senator daschle are almost identical in appearance to those they recovered in iraq in 1994 when viewed under an electron microscope
480891 i knew when he was digging ditches out at the central wyoming fair and rodeo grounds and i knew him when he was loading bentonite hundred pound bags of bentonite onto railroad cars

480906 if i think theres an issue thats not in the best interest of missourians im going to stand up and fight for them regardless of whether its against my own party or the other party or some special interest group
480907 had bought into the mind set that we need to win the election to hold on to power
480908 people are anxious about the economy so we are talking about economic issues
480909 this is another proof that these people are not interested in the welfare well being of the palestinians not on their daily needs and or even in their national political program
480910 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
480911 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
480912 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
480913 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident

480915 the mother was always working and he essentially raised the child but the father was a control freak
480916 ultimately he refused to say who he really was so she got custody

480919 we go where people are because we feel like jesus went to the people
480920 thats where people are having their conversations about things that matter
480921 we go where people are because we feel like jesus went to the people
480922 evangelicalism is becoming somewhat less coherent as a movement or as an identity
480923 younger people dont even want the label anymore they dont believe the main goal of the church is to be political
480924 the easy thing is to fight but the hard thing is to put your gloves down and work together towards a common cause
480925 our generation would like to put our gloves down we dont want to be out there picketing we want to be out there serving
480926 im comfortable with the word as long as it means a believer of christ who wants to spread his teaching
480927 but it doesnt automatically mean that you are against stem cell research or voting for mccain
480928 what the church has done wrong is that it has created these holy huddles of christian magazines music and schools that have set them apart from the world because the world is bad
480929 instead of doing what christ did and bring light to the world they retreat from it
480930 they are very much turned off by the suit and tie power brokers of the evangelical right
480931 millions of people around the world are threatened by extreme environmental policies
480932 there is so much resistance to the environmental initiative because it is a threat to the right wing agenda that has crept into the southern baptist convention
480933 how is taking care of gods creation a political issue since i am pro life i am pro environment
480934 any movement that undermines or takes away from the seriousness of sin we need to pay close attention to
480935 i dont have any evidence that being green is going to trump pro life issues in the voting booth
480936 which party stands for the issues their faith requires them to support
480937 its the first church ive been in with such opposing views

480944 youre expected to take a leap of comprehension that isnt normal for political cartoons with no cue to do so

480952 many phrases that the british may consider antiquated are still popular in india the legacy of the
480953 can you tell me how to fix this im not sure what to do
480954 no its the fact that it actually came into being think about it someone somewhere wrote a screenplay with this ridiculous dialogue in it then someone else read it and somehow thought it was good enough to option for a movie then someone with money read it and decided that it should definitely become a movie and so they financed it and then then a bunch of someone elses auditioned for the various roles characters with names like ginger and ducky because they wanted to be in it and finally someone else directed it and as a result this piece of shit actually made it to film
480955 and then someone else went out of his way to record it just because he thought it might have lots of naked boobies in it
480956 going through withdrawal over here very painful do your duty and post something man

480970 as urbahns skull showed no sign of a fracture its unlikely he was knocked out before he was stabbed and the sprawled position in which his skeleton was found suggests his hands were not tied behind his back
480971 its the killer in front who gets covered with urbahns blood a killer who does not leave blood in the subaru because he leaves the scene in another car
480972 this left an unbloodied tamihere to drive heidi to tararu creek rd where he subsequently raped and killed her
480973 things went well until murray briefly left the room and i unexpectedly found myself alone with tamihere suddenly the warm smile wilted on his lips his eyes narrowed and he stared coldly at me it was as if a switch had tripped inside his head turning off the nice david and flicking on the nasty one he sat in silence staring at me until murray came back then the switch flicked back again and the good david was suddenly back i have often wondered if in those few moments tamihere dropped his guard and showed me the man who might have murdered the swedes
480974 he was a total loner it was his nature and his preference
480975 would kayos case have received more publicity if she had been blonde and swedish instead of dark haired and japanese
480976 i was just real frightened that he was going to run me over for a second time that definitely went through my head and that i was going to end up permanently in a wheelchair all i could think of was my kids
480977 ive been asked so many times the same question by people which is would i leave my job because of this the answer is absolutely hell no
480978 i would do this again tomorrow if it meant i prevented a drunk driver from driving and killing an innocent person child or family

480980 they can do a bit of liposuction while theyre there
480981 i want to reassure people that national will not worsen the situation
480982 its clear we dont have a debt problem ratings agencies and market commentators say the same despite the current downturn we want to continue to lay the foundations for the next round of economic growth
480983 prudent debt financing is one tool we can use to get on with the job now to build infrastructure that will endure for decades
480984 national has confirmed they would borrow to cover the massive hole they will create in the public accounts if elected unless they are prepared to slash public services once again
480985 the national partys proposed economic programme for new zealand can be summed up in four words more borrowing from foreigners
480986 bill englishs attempt to justify his borrow and hope fiscal management by promising to borrow only for infrastructure is an insult to the intelligence of new zealanders

480998 after picking up 31 year old chinese fisherman xu changyun on the 25th of last month although the boat was scheduled to pick up other fishermen ho wanted to head back to taiwan early because of the alarm for typhoon fung wong
480999 but on the way back the boat experienced a severe mechanical malfunction after ho radioed in to report the malfunction the boat caught fire and capsized
481000 on the 27th xu swam ashore in china and called for help confirming that the boat had sunk
481001 as we drifted at sea within the storm radius of fung wong we only had life jackets and a buoy one of my crew chen chang keng could not swim very well but we all encouraged each other to keep going
481002 after we were rescued by a chinese fishing boat the chinese authorities transported us to beiao island nearby for medical attention and informed our families so they could come
481003 on the island we walked and walked got blisters on the soles of our feet and were sunburned so badly we were shedding a layer of skin what kept me moving was the thought of my family i knew they must be worried about me back home and i thought i had to get back alive and safe
481004 we are especially grateful to the governmental agencies and civil groups in taiwan and china and the aid teams who found us and gave us medical care
481005 despite the existence of the acts we have actually failed to achieve the objectives of the legislation the rulings have hurt the judiciarys integrity and hurt society and womans rights
481006 respecting judicial independence and having judicial staff and civil servants from other government agencies embrace the concept of gender mainstreaming are two different things the damage has been done we cant pretend that it didnt happen

481020 are gruesome reminders of the barbarity that still finds a place in south asia
481021 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
481022 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
481023 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
481024 i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
481025 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
481026 president ma will visit the ministry for about one hour to give his instructions and vision for taiwans diplomatic efforts
481027 ebook interview how to import a car into the us
481028 i saw the postcard and i am confident our security apparatus can handle this kind of thing
481029 reconciled taiwans military posture chinas current military posture and strategy that indicates there is no pressing compelling need for at the moment arms sales to taiwan
481030 independence should be a basic right for everyone each should be able to think and live as an independent person in a society
481031 based on the same idea we believe that every people or region in the world deserves to become independent if they so wish
481032 there are 23 million people in taiwan there are countless taiwanese around the world in there minds theres only one homeland and thats taiwan
481033 big china thats big massacre unification thats destruction unification thats extinction independence its life independence thats victory taiwan is its own country
481034 we have songs that support tibetan and chechen independence movements as well
481035 we were actually just some kids from a small town on the outskirt of nanchang jiangxi province who like music and hang out together
481036 in 1996 a couple of friends and i decided to form our own band and we made the kitchen at a friends house our studio
481037 so i always tell people were a band that started out in a kitchen
481038 our song lyrics were often critical of the unfair treatment we received
481039 the chinese government didnt say anything publicly but we could feel the invisible pressure
481040 for example our cds could not pass censorship laws to be released legally in china
481041 on the day before we were to fly back to china i received a call from a friend in china
481042 my friend told us that state security officials had talked to several people close to us and asked us to stay in bangkok for a while just to be safe
481043 we immediately contacted freddy lim and through him received help from human rights groups in taiwan thailand and elsewhere
481044 your ancestors for your own dignity for your people and for your brothers and sisters
481045 we want to be the child who says out loud that the emperor has no clothes
481046 but aside from telling the truth we also want to overthrow the emperor
481047 we are carrying out the old flood prevention project as drafted by su administration
481048 i dont see why we need to halt the construction until the new project plan comes i need the taipei county government to present its new plan in a month
481049 while the names of the delegation members the schedules and dates differed in the two thailand trips the content of the two reports as well as the amount asked for reimbursement were almost identical
481050 it is obvious that the government is helping a certain conglomerate
481051 no one from the company or the government has ever consulted us and every meeting they have had was under the table
481052 we will not accept the fact that they are holding this seminar just to notify us of what they plan to do
481053 to build such a big complex right in the heart of the city is absolutely preposterous
481054 no advanced countries or even the olympic stadiums in beijing were built in the city center
481055 it is not only a joke but also has no chance to succeed
481056 the rights of the general public are being sacrificed for the profits of a big company
481057 you must have confidence in yourself to earn respect from others
481058 of course i was worried about discrimination when i graduated from school and first entered the job market
481059 because all the kindergartens thought it would be very difficult to take care of a crippled child and refused to take me
481060 all classmates looked at me as if i was a freak
481061 a while later my classmates began to want to be friends with me and study with me
481062 physically challenged people may have some disabilities but that wouldnt prevent them from doing their job well
481063 if you hire a handicapped employee he or she may then be able to feed his or her family and a large part of our social welfare resources can be saved that way
481064 the charity based society still exists in most countries in the world
481065 however a charity based society only views the handicapped as people with problems and tries to cure or help them based on sympathy
481066 in such a society its not possible to have a total accessible environment for the physically challenged
481067 businesses should provide them with employment opportunities so that they instead of becoming burdens on society can contribute to it like everybody else
481068 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
481069 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
481070 with the use of modern technology the control is tighter than china ever had before
481071 this is an exercise of state power peoples rights are heavily violated is this an olympics or some kind of warfare
481072 the original idea was to invite the international community to china share the same values celebrate humanity and goodwill to speak about peace and social harmony but today you see police everywhere in every neighborhood there is tight security not just in beijing but everywhere in china people really live in a police state
481073 my fathers generation fought and lost for ideology many of them lost their lives because they wanted a just society but now we put up with shit like this
481074 to me it is not a choice of whether or not to speak out it is a matter of dignity of life
481075 from whatever direction you look at it you share the power there is no decoration it is very rare the concept looks simple but it provides the best watching experience for everybody because there are no pillars

481089 there is no evidence or information in this regard we have no reliable information
481090 we have seen the media report that al zawahiri was killed or wounded in the july 28 strike we are investigating the authenticity of the report
481091 and we checked it but we have not been able to confirm it
481092 is aware of and has been monitoring for a few days now reports that ayman al zawahiri has been killed or severely injured in the strike
481093 terrorists have lobbed hundreds of mortars in order to slow down the advancing soldiers
481094 were burmese but we live here we have no food and water here but its still better than how we are treated in burma
481095 it doesnt mean the end of the problem there will still be problems
481096 most of the children are malnourished they have no land to cultivate and legally they are not allowed to work so it makes it difficult for them
481097 they dont want to go back to burma even though they are not enjoying their living conditions in bangladesh
481098 the difference between a clever person and a wise person is that a clever person gets out of a difficult situation with huge efforts but a wise person never gets into that situation
481099 on the right of lebanons people the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories
481100 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me
481101 i believe that this fact seriously jeopardizes the trial itself
481102 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke is or whether that arm can reach me here
481103 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
481104 what i said was if anyone deserves the death penalty its karadzic and mladic
481105 that was my specific reference and if karadzic is in the hague and is still scared that i have an arm that long i guess i should treat it in a backhanded way as a compliment
481106 zimbabweans must realize that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
481107 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months
481108 the mdc believes that no amount of tinkering with currency denominations will address the zimbabwean crisis
481109 as long as there is no production we will continue to move in circles as a country
481110 if the rbz governor insists on freezing wages workers are prepared to go and camp at the rbz office even if it means taking over the rbz
481111 affirmed that iran as a state party to the npt nuclear non proliferation treaty has the right to have its fuel cycle program for peaceful purposes
481112 the ministers are of the view that sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear program are of political nature and should be promptly removed
481113 they further affirm that with increased cooperation of iran with the agency to resolve all remaining issues about its past and present nuclear activities the issue of iranian nuclear program should be solely dealt with within the agency framework and there is no legal basis that the un security council proceeds in this regard
481114 the un security council has been clear on irans obligations the iaea has been clear that iran has not been transparent
481115 and now they cant even get their friends from the nam to come out in support of their interpretation of their program it actually reinforces just how isolated they are
481116 nigeria has not done what it is supposed to do before implementing the agreement
481117 it was not only confusing but it was an aberration
481118 the status quo that i know is that there is a judgment of the international court of justice icj which the nigerian government had partly implemented and which we must completely implement
481119 the status quo that is existing in law is the final judgment of the icj which was served on the nigerian government and which held that bakassi belongs to cameroon the icj judgment is binding on us and we are not going back on its implementation
481120 we know that we are bound by the judgment of the icj but the nigerian government did not submit the green tree agreement to parliament for ratification as constitutionally required nigeria has not done what it is supposed to do before implementing the agreement
481121 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
481122 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
481123 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
481124 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
481125 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
481126 georgia has declared sniper war on the republic of south ossetia and again has attempted to spark a full scale war
481127 the ossetian side until now has withheld itself from retaliatory measures it will not do this any longer
481128 today the south ossetian side blew up a police car as a result six policemen were injured

481133 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again

481137 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board
481138 with all the hoopla with all of the publicity that has surrounded the company in the past six months there has been a great deal of misunderstanding
481139 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots and were deeply involved in every step
481140 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
481141 a girlfriend who was involved in a breakup is now trying to convince the world she was the initiator and not the victim
481142 this is a very global business and yahoo is very well positioned
481143 yahoo has a sad history of complicity with violating human rights by turning over information to the chinese government

481152 brazil will certainly assume its responsibility to preserve the amazon to combat global warming
481153 talk as if they own the amazon but we know what it represents to humanity and to brazil and what needs to be done will be done
481154 our war isnt against last months deforestation numbers its against a model that leaves people impoverished and the destroys the rain forest
481155 this is the first time brazil is accepting the link between global warming and preserving the forest
481156 for a long time brazil was violently opposed to this insisting fossil fuel was to blame thats true historically speaking but today forests play an important role
481157 this us 21 billion figure by 2021 is based on the funds potential to attract donations not on expected donations
481158 it has been in the family since around 1760 and it belonged to a benedictine convent before that

481164 the judge imposed the sentence of 18 months incarceration and she will receive credit for the time shes already served which is six months
481165 she was involved only because of her relationship with mr kuo
481166 she recognized that that was an extremely dependant relationship and that mr kuo had exercised a lot of control over her for many years she really was a victim of the circumstances of this relationship

481169 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
481170 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
481171 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
481172 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
481173 we were in contango during the last fast oil rise from late 2004 to early 2006 and then we flipped into backwardation and it corrected
481174 since early 2005 the crude oil market is in what traders call contango meaning futures contracts for a given product are priced higher than that same good for near term delivery the price of oil to be delivered four months from now is about 3 more than oil to be delivered next month
481175 fadel gheit managing director of oil and gas research for oppenheimer and co and jim norman author of the book the oil card coming out next month say that speculation is responsible for a huge part of the run up in prices
481176 the growing demand for oil by india and china and the instability of oil supplies certainly account for much of the increase but the recent spike they say is equally due to the weakness of the dollar and massive speculation
481177 they argue that oil prices are indeed determined by supply and demand not only the supply and demand for oil but also the supply and demand for oil futures oil futures are a commitment to buy 1 000 barrels of oil at a certain date at a certain price
481178 formerly most of the investments in oil futures came from energy companies the federal commodities futures trading commission cftc sharply limited investments by those outside the business to prevent precisely the kind of speculation now gripping the market
481179 but when the stock market slowed down in 2000 2002 outside investors decided to speculate in oil futures
481180 the new players were institutional investors like corporate and government pension funds sovereign wealth funds university endowments and other investors guided by brokerage firms like morgan stanley and goldman sachs
481181 to avoid the cftc caps these investors moved their operations to london setting up the international commodities exchange now they can buy all the oil futures they want
481182 michael w masters of masters capital management told congress that the volume of investment in commodities futures soared from 13 billion at the end of 2003 to 260 billion by march of 2008
481183 after a while the cftc rescinded its limits on how much speculators could buy as long as they went through special
481184 you can buy oil futures for only 5 percent down on margin a bargain considering the 50 percent margin requirement for stock market equity investments
481185 so the willingness of sellers to unload their oil futures and of buyers to acquire them sets up its own market of supply and demand that has more to do with determining the actual price of oil than even the global demand and supply for the product itself
481186 your data says the oil markets are in contango out almost 17 months albeit not very steep
481187 how do you react to this analysis by dick morris which i find a very concise summary of the speculation argument
481188 we assess the possibility of a sharp counter trend rally beginning in the immediate future as fairly substantial but since our longer term indications are so terribly arranged our suspicion lingers that such a rally may not last very long although it may be steep
481189 he thinks we could head down tomorrow or maybe mon after triple witching day

481202 to stop the impending disaster the fed will have to raise rates
481203 each time bankers have been operating against the general moral principles with a fractional reserve ratio it brings about a credit expansion unbacked by real savings that leads to an artificial inflationary economic boom which finally reverts in a crisis and economic recession in which banks inexorably fail
481204 to stop the impending disaster the fed will have to raise rates
481205 a deflationary collapse always follows a massive expansion in credit
481206 vadim if what you are saying is actually true it means you have probably driven a lot of people into an apathetic state from the financial losses you have brought on them i am very conservative and if i have experienced big losses i can only imagine what the other more adventurous subscribers must be going through what gets me is the cajones with which you represent yourselves as being true market forecasting experts not

481215 update to my spx count from the b top at 1440 on may 19 on the way to possibly 1166 impulse 1 of c seems to have bottomed yesterday tue june 24 at 1304 1 was 1440 1304 136 a zigzag 2 of c could have topped today at 1336 1336 1304 32 32 136 0 235 thats almost exactly 0 236 0 382 x 0 618 meaning a very weak retracement foreboding a strong 3 of c which started today obviously 2 of c could also not have topped today
481216 the spx gained 753 points from january 1995 through the end of 2004 10 years but had you purchased the spx the day before the last trading day of the month and exited on the opening of the fifth trading day of the month and you stayed out of the market the rest of the month the gains were 820 points thats right those six trading days on a net basis led to all the market gains the remaining 14 16 trading days of the month led nowhere sixty four percent of the trades were successful
481217 if the head of the cftc would go public in declaring that they are going to limit speculation in the near future and that could happen at any time the response in the oil futures market would be instant with demand and price dropping how much would they drop i have no idea but and here is the point of all of this the stock market is likely to act positively and jump dramatically just as the price of gas has been overly blamed for all of our economic ills so will the response to some possible gas price relief be overzealous on the up side
481218 the response in the oil futures market would be instant with demand and price dropping

481277 one more thing to help me quit when i should anyway
481278 for me i think im addicted twice once to the menthol and then second to the tobacco

481281 here i am miss healthy fit swedish flicka playing this drug addict
481282 but this play is very physical its closer to restoration comedy or french farce so you have to go out and really deliver the goods at every performance
481283 one that may prove to be a crowning moment in an illustrious career
481284 i think its had an effect on my psyche because every one of those scenes is one that i dont want to have in my own life
481285 violet doesnt want to sit down and be interrogated every scene is something she really doesnt want to have except when shes drugged out and then she seems to be comfortable
481286 ive been acting all my life and ive always felt you should be in shape im used to devoting my whole life to the work and what it requires
481287 estelle has so much stamina and so much energy and she has stayed working and never retired
481288 shes quite the opposite of violet but lets hope everyone is the opposite of that character
481289 i dont know that ill be able to do this play at 80
481290 and estelle didnt have the luxury of the rehearsal process that the original cast had most of her rehearsals for three weeks was blocking with the understudies she was just sort of thrown onstage
481291 i started doing a lot of hiking after bonnie and clyde because i just had to run away
481292 its very hard when youre in a movie that big you become notorious and people often bothered me in public
481293 those people i hiked with hardly ever knew who i was
481294 maybe they didnt go to the movies it was just a completely different orientation
481295 the outdoor activity is great fun and its such a change from urban life
481296 but listen im a theater person im not going to give up my life to go sit in the woods
481297 after meeting deanna backstage after i signed on i called my agent and asked listen am i a lamb being led to the slaughter

481314 we thought someone in their trading department had spiked the water cooler
481315 we did nothing wrong our underwriter approved the deal we funded it and the investor purchased it from us because it fit their guidelines
481316 but it would be merely a fire if there werent any message
481317 i have to hand down my fathers spirit to later generations
481318 thats what our family must do im his son i have to understand why the man brought it back here and kept it day after day
481319 he used to say since everyone is losing memories of the war i will be the one who will never forget
481320 the flame has become public but still carries my fathers soul
481321 its time to end the foolish practice of killing one another
481322 war will never end just because such a flame has been lit
481323 i have to tell people about my fathers heart and let them think by themselves
481324 my son told me the other day dad its the duty of the yamamoto family isnt it
481325 i havent even once told them what to do but they naturally understood what im thinking about
481326 you buy a us 99 wall e robot but they dont work particularly hard to give it personality and as much as i love my iphone theres no chance its going to love me back
481327 is about robots that can trigger emotional responses in people or even look like they have human like emotions themselves
481328 people have an expectation of what a dog or cat will behave like its more difficult to suspend your disbelief when youre looking at something thats like but isnt a dog or cat its easier with a dinosaur
481329 once i had the initial prototype up and running and i had a hexapod that could see and respond to the people it met it became a short jump to allow it to remember them too
481330 once ic has locked on to a persons face ive programmed it to wait a short time and then capture that face as a digital photo the robot has an internet connection so as soon as it has met someone and remembered them or rather taken their photo it publishes the image to its blog
481331 pleo is about an emotional relationship and a bond the endgame is the next generation interface its the difference between r2 d2 in star wars and commander data in star trek the next generation r2 d2 is limited in its interface but if you get the interface right then we can explore the whole depth of the machine its not that people dont want to use all their machines capabilities its that the barrier to use is too great so our philosophy is really to breathe life into any machine
481332 maybe the next one will be emotional and not entertainment
481333 we learned from last week it was a learning experience for us all particularly for the coaches
481334 we changed our pattern and our kicking game paid dividends we took our opportunities this week and that last bonus point try was just the icing on the cake
481335 it was a pretty good performance from the all blacks
481336 they built pressure and they profited from that and didnt allow us to build pressure and they grew in confidence we came up a distant second here and we have some downtime before we go to africa and look forward to that opportunity
481337 its not pressure so much from the outside as knowing that you have to contribute or you are letting the team down today was very special everything went my way and its a day i wont forget its been tough over the past couple of months
481338 for a dream for the truth for a hope for our state for ukraine

481343 its been a pretty decent weekend for us so far and i feel safe with the position were in
481344 the team have done a great job in improving our car even from the last weekend and it would be great to get a one two on sunday it would be about time
481345 i wasnt 100 percent happy with my laps in q3
481346 i went out on the track at a little bit of a wrong time when there were too many cars around that made it really tricky for the preparation of my tires but i think our lap times from the first two qualifying sessions showed that we are pretty strong
481347 i think if i played a couple of mens tournaments in a row itd be a different story but its hard to play one a year you know
481348 i am taking away a lot of good things from this week
481349 i made some really good putts some really good drives i know that there are some things i need to work on but i feel like i learned a lot
481350 i think if i played a couple of mens tournaments in a row itd be a different story but its hard to play one a year you know
481351 i think if i played eight in a row and missed all eight thatd be a different story
481352 but i gave it my best today and i feel like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones that i made mistakes on
481353 i had about a 10 footer there and thought if i birdie the last five ill shoot 59 that was the worst thing to think and led to me making par there
481354 i havent had very much success with him in the past
481355 i think im a little more mature the guys nasty with the cutter i wanted to hit it hard past derek jeter past somebody
481356 those guys are good you have to tip your cap
481357 i like my chances it was very hard with the wind today but i played well and im feeling very good for the weekend
481358 its disappointing because i wanted to come here and enjoy it and not be worried about playing at the weekend
481359 but its only two rounds theres a long way to go
481360 it was a big putt because i wanted to go into the weekend with a bit of momentum
481361 i didnt want to bogey the last two but that putt looked good and i felt i could make it
481362 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
481363 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
481364 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
481365 the only thing sure other than death and taxes is that deposit insurance premiums will be going up as more banks fail
481366 no one and no side has the right to infringe on the sovereignty of the state by concluding security political or economic agreements
481367 he just looked worried depressed anxious way turned into himself
481368 it would be overstating it to say he looked like a guy who was being led to his execution but its not far off
481369 almost everybody believes that he had absolutely nothing to do with amerithrax
481370 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
481371 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
481372 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
481373 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
481374 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
481375 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
481376 at some point people are going to have make some decisions are we going to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done

481378 energy independent its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
481379 i would rather be a one term president and do what i believe is right than to be a two term president at the cost of seeing america become a second rate power and to see this nation accept the first defeat in its proud 190 year history

481388 kill and eat all danish people over the cartoon images of the prophet mohammad which appeared in danish newspapers he pledges to assassinate the illustrator and saraa also agrees that she would martyr herself for the cause of palestine
481389 after taking several calls saraa asks the children do you think we should go ahead and chop off assuds hand now the terrified rabbit slumps to his knees and pleads no no saraa im begging you in the end saraa acting as judge and jury rules that his ear should be cut off instead but this was not shown on the programme
481390 we are not terrorists sure we do not support terrorism ok whatever we are normal people i sure as shit hope not but we are defending our homeland maybe the israelis hit next door to my house with a shell bummer i was wounded on my feet and my little brother youssef was wounded in the legs that genuinely sucks we as muslims are against suicide bombers bullshit you invented the suicide bomber we are against the death of civilians on all sides wtf we are only the enemy of those who took our land and kill us every day oh so all jews americans and british
481391 mom and dad loved the missionaries and invited them into our home often for meals
481392 sherlene i hear from bishop free that youre worried about my having to support three missionaries at the same time your mother and i never told you about this because we did not want you to feel compelled however we felt watching you grow up that you might want to someday serve a mission so we have saved regularly for that there is enough money in a separate account to cover your full mission this is your decision and you have our support whatever you decide but if you decide not to go youre going to have to come up with a better reason than that the money isnt there

481395 it was strange because as soon as i joined twente i knew we had the draw coming up i expected one of the english teams i think fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this draw on one hand its very very tough for us but on the other it is very exciting
481396 in one respect its a tough draw for us on the other its now an opponent we know very well not just myself everyone in holland knows the premier league well so arsenal will be no strangers to us
481397 this is a reward for a great achievement last season in reaching this stage to get one of the big teams it will be a once in a lifetime experience that doesnt come along that often im sure the fans will be delighted
481398 we will be pleased with the draw logistically holland isnt too far and it will give our fans the opportunity to see the game as you rightly say its a reunion with steve and we are looking forward to it when steve was first team coach for the national team and then manager they used to use our training ground at london colney so there are good relations there
481399 he can retire with a great deal of pride because he had an immense career it has been a pleasure to play at his side
481400 on a human level he is also an extraordinary guy and on the pitch he was a warrior who never gave up
481401 i have a lot of memories of him but i think there comes a point when it is time to retire he extended his sell by date for as long as possible and he needed to retire what he has done has been exceptional
481402 lilian has had a great career i looked at the number of appearances he made and they just went on and on
481403 i spoke to him about two or three months ago and asked him what he had planned the career he had was always at the highest level and when there is a health risk it is better that he retires
481404 there are family reasons which have also been taken into account
481405 i wanted to be the paolo maldini of psg but that has not been possible
481406 i cant wear sexy gowns or high heels i cant have a boyfriend and i walk like a boy sometimes i get jealous as my female friends go to school while i have to lift weights

481411 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
481412 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
481413 when i was 22 i was a different guy so im not trying to spin anything
481414 you spend two hours with somebody and now you know them thats not the case
481415 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what the repercussions are from this event
481416 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here the focus is not where it needs to be right now

481418 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
481419 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
481420 the data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the united states as well as black men and women
481421 it also mirrors what we see about sexually transmitted diseases and changes in risk behavior among men who have sex with men
481422 the reality is that it is a wake up call for all of us
481423 there are things that you and i can do to stop the disease encourage others to use condoms consistently and correctly abstain from sex
481424 it is important to note that the new estimate does not represent an actual increase in the annual number of new hiv infections
481425 in fact cdcs analysis suggests that the epidemic has been roughly stable since the late 1990s though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
481426 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s

481466 chief rubin desires to move swiftly and deal very seriously with the actions that have been found to have occurred
481467 there is no room in this department for such behavior

481469 a review of this case has revealed deficiencies in treatment that warrant corrective action
481470 in the early moments we were trying to contain the fire to one side of the building and what they saw from the helicopters was firefighters up on the roof cutting holes to relieve the smoke
481471 its really hard to just lose everything that you had

481479 we are meeting in secret with a congressional committee if these meetings were public it would prove
481480 unfortunately the ruling didnt go for us and myself and everybody else at the football club are massively disappointed
481481 i believe rudolph is going to be an exceptional player so to have worked 18 months trying to get him is disappointing
481482 hes obviously upset by it but hes a great lad and hell make sure it doesnt affect him
481483 make sure that the known criminals are kept under control
481484 answering a question about his approach to combatting crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge as part of his argument mccain praised the crime fighting efforts of former new york mayor rudolph giuliani urban league president marc morial countered that while new york did experience a drop in crime under giuliani there were several major instances of police misconduct to which mccain promised aggressive prosecution of civil rights violations and a justice department free from political cronyism

481728 sepertinya lawan sudah tahu kelemahan saya meskipun kami tidak pernah bertemu di lapangan
481729 tentu saat kembali ke padang golf ini saya akan berusaha untuk melakukan pukulan sesedikit mungkin sesuai kemampuan yang saya miliki dan tentu saya tidak akan memikirkan apa yang akan dibuat phil mickelson
481730 saya yakin phil mickelson juga akan berkonsentrasi pada permainannya itu sebabnya saya hanya bisa berharap agar besok kami akan tetap memperoleh hari baik
481731 saya memang bukan pemilik putter yang hebat namun putter saya juga tidak jelek sekali namun kalau besok anda melihat ada satu putter saya yang meleset dari lubang itu memperlihatkan bahwa memang saya tengah melakukan kesalahan
481732 sangat bagus indonesia saya tidak menyangka indonesia punya tim sebaik ini
481733 namun karena ada acara yang harus saya hadiri pukul 10 00 nanti jadi kali ini saya tidak bisa menyelesaikan permainan 18 hole cukup 9 hole saja
481734 bola sepertinya mengerti bahwa harus ada pemerataan sekalipun pada akhirnya kita semua kalah satu pukulan dari pak jusuf

481763 harapanku bisa di olimpiade nanti yang realistis itu ya aku harus bisa memperbaiki prestasi terbaikku
481764 itu sebabnya di beijing nanti saya berharap bisa memperbaiki hasil terbaik diri saya
481765 mungkin karena saya kerap mengikuti kejuaraan dunia sehingga induk organisasi menembak dunia memberikan perhatian kepada indonesia untuk memberikan wild card mereka agar ada atlet menembak indonesia yang juga bisa ambil bagian di olimpiade
481766 contoh yang paling saya rasa itu ketika tim jateng kalah dari sumatera selatan di pon lalu saat itu keputusan panitia pertandingan yang merugikan kontingen jateng terus memengaruhi penampilan individu

481920 ha una capacit universale ed una forza comprensiva che si estende ed abbraccia tutto che
481921 lelemento psicologico della potenza intelligente lelemento ontologico dellobbietto inteso e lelemento logico nella forza che li connette e nella sua unit li riassume e li rappresenta
481922 i fatti le leggi ossia i principi e lassoluto formano i tre elementi dellumano pensiero ed insieme i tre gradi successivi della sua empirica manifestazione ed ogni idea ogni concetto umano come del pari ogni oggetto li contiene tutti e li rappresenta
481923 la logica vi scritto ha la sua derivazione dal greco logov che in latino si traduce in
481924 essenza del sapere considerato nel suo profondo e vero concetto il raddoppiare se tutto ci che sa raddoppiando se stesso perci la coscienza non crea ma vede ci che riflette sa ci che raddoppia sapendo se stessa
481925 l necessario e primitivo che si manifesta nel sentimento fondamentale dellesistenza delluomo contiene implicitamente in se i germi delle prime verit universali
481926 in cui si trovano complicati la potenza lobietto ed il nesso che unisce la potenza allobietto
481927 la infallibile veduta della potenza intelligente ma esso non potrebbe avere esistenza nella stessa potenza senza lobietto
481928 perch risulta da due estremi semplicissimi ed identici riuniti in un sol atto logico qual quello della potenza che nella sua veggente identit contiene forse le sue identit dalle quali risulta
481929 la potenza intelligente ed il mondo con cui la potenza ha un nesso reale e contingente
481930 della quale astrazione intuitiva dalla intelligenza umana nel fondo del suo essere
481931 la connessa a formare idee generali che divengono tipi di altre verit e da queste dedurre altre verit particolari
481932 si d un principio supremo cio dellidentit sotto questo criterio la forza logica si separa in tre modi inventando inducendo deducendo
481933 la prima si d quando da un attributo conosciuto passa ad un incognito la seconda quando da un individuo a pi individui passa ad un concetto grande la terza quando dal genere passa al particolare
481934 n pu essere altro il mezzo di passaggio a conoscere e trovare la verit poich lidentico non pu agire n pu ordinamento passare che mediante lidentit cio in conformit alla identit concreta ed assoluta causa identica di tutte le identit moltiplici in fondo delle quali trovasi lo stesso identico che a tutte partecipa senza dividersi
481935 i principi generali sono astratti ed universali e su di essi convengono tutti gli uomini
481936 cagione ultima per cui esiste nello spirito umano la disposizione a generalizzare
481937 la quale il mezzo empirico per cui essa apparisce e si rende manifesta e per ci stesso la ragione umana conoscendo i fatti in essi e per essi apparisce la cagione lessere il vero universale quindi nellumana ragione convergono e si accentrano due induzioni una soggettiva laltra oggettiva della stessa e medisima verit
481938 come si moltiplicano le idee afferma il filosofo si sviluppa il sentimento fondamentale e lo spirito comincia a mettere in esercizio le sue facolt ed avere consapevolezza delle sue operazioni
481939 nel senso che lidea lespressione e limmagine di un concetto che comprende una determinata combinazione d principi questo concetto contenuto nella intelligenza infinita che lo concepisce e siccome eterna lintelligenza ed immutabile nel suo concepimento cos lo sono i concetti di cui le idee sono lespressione
481940 la possibilit della riunione e per il limite la possibilit della separazione o in altri termini la possibilit della induzione e della deduzione
481941 concetti umani subbiettivi rispondenze ontologiche e modelli eterni della intelligenza divina nello stesso tempo
481942 le concezioni delle repliche e le loro sole possibilit bisognano le repliche delle idee gi formate rispondenti ai fatti reali o dei rapporti reali
481943 lassoluto preesista e sia la possibilit della legge come la legge la possibilit del fatto pure per conoscere empiricamente e la legge e lassoluto bisogna la osservazione del fatto
481944 losservazione metodica dei fatti conduce alla esistenza delle leggi e la conoscenza delle leggi ci mena allassoluto
481945 lume e forza a tutti gli altri princ pi ed essi si risolvono in ultimo nellassoluto principio e leggi del tutto tutti gli assiomi non sono che lespressione della verit concreta questa lapparizione dellassoluto alla umana intelligenza tanto in se stessa quanto in tutti gli altri oggetti delluniverso
481946 il mio essere ha la sua causa questa verit particolare ogni essere ha la sua causa questa generale di queste due verit una dipende dallaltra perch una implica laltra
481947 massa di propriet di cui si oppongono i fatti identici che costituiscono il genere la specie o la classe
481948 il ragionare dunque non consiste che nellapplicare lidentit indeterminata alla stessa identit determinata da un rapporto
481949 si paragono lidea di circolo e di rotondit di tutto e di parti prese assieme si scorge immediatamente il rapporto didentit per cui luna rappresenta ed identica allaltra e lo spirito pronuncia il suo assenso egli fa un giudizio
481950 universali nella conseguenza che nelle premesse poich allora vi sarebbero quattro termini ed il sillogismo sarebbe inconcludente
481951 tu sei mortale dunque non devi conservare un odio immortale
481952 argomento cornuto perch le sue parti sono disposte in modo che se si evita luna si incorre nellaltra
481953 perch il dilemma possa esserci bisogna che fra le parti non vi sia mezzo anche se i membri della proposizione disgiuntiva fossero tre o quattro
481954 cos dalla struttura dei sensi dal moto spontaneo che osserviamo negli uomini e n bruti argomentiamo che s negli uomini come negli altri si danno sensibilit e sensazioni

481973 the last flowering in mizoram in 1958 59 caused a famine that killed between 10 000 and 15 000 people and destroyed hundreds of thousands of livelihoods
481974 the mizos formed a few famine fighting squads the most prominent of these groups was the mizo famine front mff launched by a young bank clerk named laldenga eventually the mizo famine front was converted into the mizo national front mnf with independence as its goal
481975 the blossoming the rat problem and the food shortages began two years ago in india then moved into bangladesh in january and have now headed south into burma as well
481976 thats when mizoram will go to the polls to elect representatives to its 40 member assembly zoramthanga had better start praying for a pied piper to rescue his party at the polls
481977 during this visit i have seen how the mnf government has failed to tackle the famine despite huge central funds allocated to deal with the famine
481978 my wife my five children and i normally eat rice but the rats have destroyed everything all we have left are the rats and these wild potatoes
481979 critical point food scarcity and hunger in burmas chin state
481980 as many as 200 villages may be directly affected by severe food shortages and no less than 100 000 people or 20 percent of the entire population of chin state may be in need of immediate food aid
481981 in the most affected areas of paletwa and matupi townships farmers are left with just a tenth of their usual harvest after the rats attack their rice fields
481982 the situation is at a critical point the people of chin state are on the brink of starvation action must be taken now to respond to this crisis
481983 the soldiers shot some rats that weighed as much as 15 kilograms the soldiers were amazed at the size of the rats and took pictures for their record
481984 we saw stick thin children and old women who hardly had the strength left to dig up roots to eat villagers were telling of vast packs of rats thousands strong which would turn up overnight out of the bamboo thickets and eat everything in sight
481985 the reports that are trickling out to india are heartbreaking they tell of dehydrated children dying of diarrhea and the poorest and weakest being left behind as stronger villagers start to escape over the border to where there is food we dont really know what is happening deep inside chin state where there are no telephones or roads we fear that thousands will die if no help is made available
481986 my personality is very up tempo and that reflects the way i pitch but i saw that was working against me
481987 one thing that griff bowie baysox pitching coach mike griffin has really been working on me with is pitching aggressively but still under control when i get a little quick i start rushing to the plate the ball stays away and i give up hits
481988 ive been doing little things like instead of jogging out to the mound im walking out there and walking off
481989 just doing whatever i can to slow the game down
481990 if you asked a lot of hitters theyd say the hardest ball to hit is one than moves i learned the hard way earlier last year when i was throwing a lot of four seam fastballs you can throw it as hard as you want but if you miss that spot youre going to pay for it
481991 but that sinker has a little more room for error if you do miss your spot and you miss the barrel of the bat hopefully youll get a ground ball with my sinker and my change up having the same kind of action it makes my change up that much better too
481992 from the end of last year to this year i feel like ive learned how to pitch read hitters and consider things i hadnt thought about in the past
481993 it is significant that major fishing organizations in three countries and a region japan china south korea and taiwan coordinate with an eye to restoring resources
481994 i think its very misleading to say these figures challenge our the governments figures they are a different calculation altogether
481995 syria and iran would continue the exchange of ideas in the framework that would not impair irans right of peaceful use of nuclear energy provided by the non proliferation treaty
481996 ive always wanted to be married with kids i almost had a checklist in my head career check marriage check kids check i cant wait
481997 contemporary witnesses told us that honecker was more or less frightened or shocked when he walked through here
481998 we have drafted our proposal with an aim to address the forward taking changes in writing a new constitution to socio economic transformation and to take the peace process to a logical end
481999 the first to reinvigorate the consumer product safety commission and strengthen its ability to assure safe toys for our children
482000 the second is legislation that provides the authority to regulate tobacco and stop tobacco companies from targeting our kids
482001 the house and the senate passed the bill to protect our children and say that the safety commission must keep lead out of toys ban plastic softening chemicals called phthalates from the toys kids can put in their mouths and require science not politics or corporate interests to guide its actions
482002 tomorrow i will be meeting afghan president hamid karzai on whose country this attack has taken place if he gives us some evidence of isis involvement we will look into the matter
482003 we will see a number of failures as there are quite a lot of weak carriers that will not survive we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
482004 the difference between 74 73 75 theres not that much difference once you reach that level you might as well go to 75
482005 but i think that puts their increases away at least for a couple of years
482006 put harvard mit and princeton together and you begin to get an idea of the status of this school in india
482007 iits have enjoyed the three basic freedoms of an educational institution freedom to choose whom to teach who will teach and what to teach the iits also enjoy full cost budgetary support the iits remain successful so long as these amenities continue
482008 in the past few years iits have been ranked as the top educational institutions in india and asia by national and international magazines however the only objective ranking of top 500 universities worldwide by research output has been done by professor nian cai liu and his colleagues at the shanghai jiao tong university in china in this list the only institutions to make it from india are the iits and the indian institute of science bangalore this is indeed a matter of great pride
482009 i would never want to be a member of a group whose symbol was a man nailed to two pieces of wood
482010 russia is seriously concerned over the escalation of tensions in the zone of the georgian south ossetian conflict and is taking emergency steps to prevent further violence between the conflicting sides
482011 russia urges tbilisi and tskhinvali to show restraint and willingness to search for ways to resolve the crisis
482012 there is no way that allowing offshore drilling would lower gas prices right now
482013 the department of energy has acknowledged that it wont provide short term relief if we started drilling today the first drop of oil wouldnt come for another seven years even then it wouldnt have a large impact on prices because it would go to a world oil market the chinese and the indians they can buy that oil just like us you would not see any significant savings
482014 the good people of these colonies are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown and that all political connection between them and the state of great britain is and ought to be totally dissolved

482020 the old feudal doctrine stated by blackstone and adopted as part of the common law of england is not only at war with the theory of our institutions but is equally at war with every principle of justice and of sound public policy
482021 they are human beings with dignity and rights that should be respected we are working with the full effort of the mexican government to bring a halt to the campaigns that harass migrants
482022 probe captain of tug wasnt aboard at time of collision
482023 bibi is likely to be prime minister after the next elections
482024 this government has reached an end and it doesnt matter who heads kadima they are all partners in this governments total failure
482025 but its impossible to predict whats going to happen there are too many variables
482026 has a prime ministerial aura and experience in executive positions precisely what livni lacks
482027 who the fuck does he think he is whos the fucking superpower here
482028 as a kind of speed bump that would have to be negotiated until a new israeli prime minister came along who was more serious about peace
482029 savvy politician mindful of the sound bite and always ready to use it he tended to impress and befriend his interlocutors often by stretching or hiding part of the truth
482030 netanyahu believes that the economic sphere is one where we can make quick tangible progress create more jobs and generate growth
482031 that may yield the kind of political payoffs that could further political negotiations
482032 but bibi may in fact be more sane on this issue than mofaz or barak

482049 we suspect that the council have not set out to contravene or reverse their own equal employment policies and that this problem results from someone in the council acting in a thoughtless way
482050 all of them have been in a bad way the allotment is cleaner than half the houses they have sent us to
482051 my fear that the blog was becoming too negative in tone i regard myself as a centrist i believe very much that in proper doses copyright is essential for certain classes of works especially commercial movies commercial sound recordings and commercial books the core copyright industries i accept that the level of proper doses will vary from person to person and that my recommended dose may be lower or higher than others but in my view and that of my cherished brother sir hugh laddie we are well past the healthy dose stage and into the serious illness stage much like the u s economy things are getting worse not better copyright law has abandoned its reason for being to encourage learning and the creation of new works instead its principal functions now are to preserve existing failed business models to suppress new business models and technologies and to obtain if possible enormous windfall profits from activity that not only causes no harm but which is beneficial to copyright owners like humpty dumpty the copyright law we used to know can never be put back together again multilateral and trade agreements have ensured that and quite deliberately
482052 they tell me that they are in no hurry to sell
482053 if a sovereign wealth fund came along with a huge amount of money then theyd be tempted but i suspect part of it would be getting to the stage where bernie is replaced
482054 if someone wanted to buy it the whole business at the moment depends on a man who is 78 years old
482055 following recent press speculation cvc is pleased to clarify a number of matters
482056 we have no plans to sell our stake in formula 1
482057 we see our investment as long term and we are pleased with its performance to date
482058 the formula one group continues to be led by bernie ecclestone there are no plans to replace him and we are delighted with the results of the business under his management
482059 the target was to do a 1m21 7s or 21 8s and we did a 21 6s so that was the most we could get out of the car
482060 the balance was not too bad but unfortunately the grip level is still very poor
482061 i think were not particularly quick round here and we have to accept that
482062 it was a hot tough qualifying and i am not 100 happy with the session
482063 the tyres did not behave as we expected and i had lots of graining which meant we couldnt get a good balance out of the car
482064 overall im not that happy but lets see what happens tomorrow
482065 it would be very easy to say were on the back row again but weve been eliminated from q1 with a bmw a honda and a williams so clearly this is a very competitive field here yet again
482066 one second from the top 10 shows were getting closer
482067 although we have had to revert back to the standard shift box for the weekend we are very optimistic about running the seamless shift gearbox and look forward to actually racing it in valencia
482068 its a shame to miss out on q3 by one hundredth but we expected it to be tight
482069 we can be happy though especially given i only managed nine laps yesterday
482070 now we can do what we like in terms of fuel load for the race and hopefully find a good strategy
482071 ive yet to do a long run this weekend but i think we can find a good compromise between qualifying and race pace and we have a good set up on the car
482072 for vettel the one unknown tomorrow will be driving on a full tank as he has not had the chance to try it
482073 i struggled with the option tyre as it gave me no grip and i was sliding around more and had no feel for the car
482074 i made a mistake on my final flying lap which cost me precious time and that followed on from not having got a great lap on my previous attempt which explains why im sixth
482075 of course i am not happy and starting from the third row my race will be an uphill struggle
482076 i will try and make the most of this situation given that the car today was not that bad
482077 we are going through a bit of a difficult time but we mustnt give up all we need to do is put together all the pieces of the jigsaw and then the results will come to us again
482078 our main aim this weekend was and still is to get the most out of our car tyre team package and today we failed to do that especially in the final part of qualifying
482079 now we have to try and do it in tomorrows race it will be tough because our grid positions are not the best and we are up against very strong opposition but it is not an impossible task
482080 we have strong potential which we saw today it will be a case of getting all the elements to come together as well as possible
482081 the first irregularity i would mention is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
482082 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself
482083 on the honesty and the loyalty of the current security force in kirkuk
482084 marginalize any other ethnic group control kirkuk and annex it to kurdistan
482085 the kurds want to lay bricks for an independent state but escalating tensions will not bring any good to anyone
482086 do you have a never ending list do you manage your time do you manage minutes tasks and lists do you start each day with a list that has more on it at the end of the day than it did at the beginning of the day in spite of how many items are completed and crossed off or do you manage your attention do you manage emotions intention and make choices about what will and will not get done what are your favorite ways to do this
482087 weve gone to the hotels spa we went to the nature preserve weve taken a catamaran tour of the bay and were about to rent a speedboat we could have had the same vacation in mexico but it would have cost us a whole lot more

482095 seeing for the first time perhaps because its now right there on their site how customers talk about their products
482096 i am the bread of life he who comes to me will never go hungry and he who believes in me will never be thirsty
482097 i dont think its right i really dont think its right
482098 we are in talks with a couple of networks right now we have one picked out but nothing is signed yet
482099 we actually got approached about doing it by multiple people
482100 it was one of those things where we were like wow lets totally do it i think its sort of a fun way to show the other side of celebrity and a sort of semi normal life
482101 when youre dating someone its when are you going to get married then you get married and its whens the baby then you have a baby and its whens the divorce so i guess i should count myself lucky were still at the whens the baby stage
482102 we both want lots of children we believe that when the time is right to have a child then god will bless us with one
482103 whats extraordinary is the way everything modern fits in with everything old its all a matter of combining theres no beginning or end there only continuity
482104 in 1957 gravois bank opened two drive up windows the drive up windows were so successful that in 1963 they expanded to six then eight with two additional walk up windows
482105 when youre in the centre its easy not to be aware of the historic origins
482106 rather than simply talking about things weve been talking about for years we need something more concrete
482107 part of the sacrifice most american bishops are willing to make is accepting a covenant and holding to a moratoria on approving gay blessings and ordinations of gay bishops

482119 la oposici n debe enfocarse en demostrar que el proyecto de reforma sigue vivito y coleando
482120 el prop sito de este instrumento era la construcci n del socialismo y no lo hizo
482121 la ley habilitante fall desde su formulaci n y ya los cinco motores de la revoluci n fracasaron

482130 both leaders expressed their disappointment that a breakthrough in the negotiations was not reached this week in geneva particularly given how close trade ministers came to reaching an agreement

482132 both sides emphasised the importance of iranian syrian cooperation which is aimed at consolidating stability and security in the region
482133 during the visit the two sides will discuss tehrans nuclear issue
482134 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
482135 an insult to the judicial system and an affront to the victims of eta
482136 the revised cdc figure represents an unacceptable level of new hiv infections for a preventable disease the revised estimate underlines the need for a national aids strategy with measurable outcomes reliance on evidence based programs and sufficient funding
482137 stopping the spread of hiv and treating all people living with hiv must be a high priority for our leaders and the american public
482138 this is not just another set of statistics there are people behind these numbers people are becoming infected with a disease that is preventable we know how to prevent hiv but we have been fighting this epidemic with one hand tied behind our back reflecting a disturbing dismissal of hiv prevention as a public health priority
482139 the new higher estimate is yet one more wake up call to our national leaders that they need to do more starting with developing and implementing a real national aids strategy
482140 i was very afraid to leave their family because i was happy i had a family and i kept holding on to them all the time trying not to lose them
482141 it was the family that raised me that rescued me i also didnt want to leave poland i thought it was the country that let me live
482142 but i was 15 years old i was incredibly scared of the bombs i was no hero
482143 i think of my mother often because she was the dearest person in my life it stays with you all the time what you go through you cant throw it out of your memory
482144 my husband is very religious and doesnt especially care for the jews
482145 anytime he tried to say something against the jews i would tell him you forget who i am
482146 i hate not playing and i hate withdrawing from tournaments
482147 its the most hollow feeling every when you have to walk off because youre hurt and you know people have come to watch you play
482148 its not necessarily james bond like spying where you have some super spy penetrating the deepest u s secrets
482149 its trying relentlessly to get defense related technology from u s companies u s engineers and the u s military
482150 theyre claiming that we built this house with money he earned illegally
482151 theres isnt a shred of truth in it not one dime
482152 he is totally unable to lie it is not his nature hes as honest and truthful and trusting as they come
482153 he wants to show the world that hes innocent and he wants to clear his name
482154 while the cdcs new report may demonstrate improved national hiv surveillance we have plenty of work ahead turning this data into something we can use to reduce new infections across the u s
482155 to make measurable progress against hiv we need to know whether infection rates are going up which groups are becoming infected and which prevention activities reduce new infections we need a comprehensive national aids strategy with measurable outcome targets a timeline for action increased funding and a particular focus on those most at risk including racial and ethnic minorities
482156 hiv aids continues to be a public health emergency that has not received adequate nor appropriate attention as a nationwide priority
482157 it is ironic that the cdc is announcing these long awaited figures at the international aids conference where we are hearing success stories from countries implementing vibrant national aids strategies as a major requirement for receiving u s funds via pepfar
482158 the cdcs nearly two year delay in disclosing these figures from 2006 exacerbates continued peril to the countrys most at risk communities including african americans and latinos who bear the brunt of the epidemic
482159 also recent evidence of rising hiv diagnoses among gay men and other men who have sex with men especially among young gay men of color is a clear example of why a new approach is desperately needed to obtain progress against hiv aids in the u s
482160 only with increased resources and a cogent and well implemented national aids strategy can we bring down hiv incidence increase access to care and reduce persistent racial and ethnic disparities in the hiv aids epidemic
482161 a comprehensive outcomes oriented strategy is the best way to ensure provision of evidence based programming including needle exchange programs and comprehensive sex education for youth
482162 americas workers face an economic squeeze with rising prices fewer jobs and a financial crisis unrestrained unregulated and greed driven economics have produced the crisis we face today there is too much power and too much wealth in too few hands we need to implement policies that bring balance fairness and equality to the economy and the workplace
482163 i took my father to the hospital with a swollen leg i could tell that he was retaining fluid but the hospital dismissed him saying it could be gout but they werent sure just a few days later he had a heart attack
482164 my dad almost died because he didnt receive the health care he needed he served and protected our nation but now our healthcare system is failing him and hes not alone
482165 companies can just do whatever they want stalling or waiting it out and threatening employees so that they dont really get a union even though everybody wants one
482166 and the way it is now theres no real punishment for doing that its not fair
482167 you hear about companies doing this kind of stuff all the time we need better policies from washington that make it easier for workers to join a union without the company interfering
482168 our judgment is that this merciless attack was the work of the bloody separatist terror group
482169 those who helped those who gave shelter and those who took part in the attack have been caught
482170 on the honesty and the loyalty of the current security force in kirkuk
482171 marginalize any other ethnic group control kirkuk and annex it to kurdistan

482176 our grandfather thought frank was a point of connection a bridge if you will to the larger african american experience for my brother
482177 frank was part of a group of black vanguard intellectuals
482178 the people that he came into contact with throughout his life like richard wright and margaret walker were very significant
482179 you could get a lot of strength from a person like frank who had suffered all the discrimination that a black man goes through in america
482180 mccarthy era strategy of smear tactics and condemnation by association
482181 writings of frank marshall davis a voice of the black press
482182 he made his vision into a beacon a light shedding understanding and enlightenment on the problems that denied people regardless of race national origin or economic status their constitutional rights
482183 with his books and whiskey breath and the hint of hard earned knowledge behind the hooded eyes
482184 its been plenty of challenges thats for sure its a alot of breaking points what curves to hit what not to hit its tough because i am not a road course driver well get a hang of it hopefully i will learn a few new things
482185 ive never seen an artist like eboo a superb writer and performer i cant wait to hear his new album

482223 hi my name is scott denham i just moved in to the palisades with my wife and two young children twenty seconds left im here because we have a major major rodent problem theres an infestation on my neighbors property its spilling over and its posing a serious health risk to my family ten seconds left i need your help were not getting any help from the city or the county
482224 rosendahls deputy reported that the councilmans office has contacted the appropriate agencies in the city and the issue is being addressed as expeditiously as possible
482225 that number could be monstrous you could get numbers approaching hundreds of thousands of rats its impossible to quantify
482226 this is the first time ive heard of someone living with that many rats we dont have problems to that level
482227 if youre rich you live in beverly hills if youre famous you live in malibu and if youre lucky you live in pacific palisades
482228 its 100 percent centered on family its a neighborhood where there are kids on every block for us it was an ideal place
482229 it looked like any other neighborhood on the alphabet streets
482230 im standing out there with my 4 year old son and theres this giant rat standing about four feet away from us
482231 just looking at us in broad daylight as if it were a pet
482232 kind of climbed up on the boxes off the ground and sort of watched this thing just nonchalantly walk around inside my garage and onto my yard
482233 you start to realize that as you go to that property wait a minute
482234 you couldnt see in any of the windows i dont know if it was tarp but it wasnt just curtains it was blacked out you couldnt see in the house the front door was rotted
482235 that was the house that you just didnt walk up to on halloween
482236 they had dozens of dogs and cats in their house now they consider rats pets
482237 they basically said yeah well be out there within the next two weeks
482238 i was like whoa thats something a person doesnt forget i have never seen it before and i have never seen it since thats something you never forget
482239 we just dont have room we throw it away consider this we do more than half a million inspections a year of various types where do you think we would keep that kind of bulk of records
482240 rats in the neighbors house they feed them and state they cannot kill these rodents please talk to other neighbor on the opposite side of redacted please call him
482241 my mommy and daddy are scared im afraid rats are going to eat my toys
482242 the kid just moved from a new city he doesnt know anybody and this is what hes telling his teacher in the first week of school
482243 but here we are cursing and threatening people with lawsuits ive turned into this negative and angry person who is protecting us
482244 led to the point of liz saying if you guys dont get rid of the rats then were going to file a lawsuit because we have no choice
482245 margaret said something to the effect of dont bother because were just going to sell the house and get out of here
482246 the article in the palisadian post will print this thursday it is going to name their names address and will have pictures i will be working tirelessly to get inside that house via the health department city attorney and building and safety who will at that point potentially red tag and obviously shut down margarets nonpermitted guesthouse this could all obviously be avoided should they sell but if not we will stop at nothing to solve this problem which according to margaret has been going on since 1984 this is simply a battle they can not win
482247 the sisters were seriously believing everything these women liz denham and her real estate agent elizabeth stein were saying as far as red tagging their house and that they d be thrown out and theyd have to leave
482248 had told me she didnt care if and these are her words she didnt care if when they tore the house down if the ladies were inside it or not
482249 i asked her if she was jewish i preached the gospel for one half hour after i spoke and preached the gospel the lord preaching it through me her attitude completely changed
482250 no i have the blood of jesus on my house every night
482251 ill tell you why at the last minute an angel appeared in the name of my nephew richard otto who said you want to stay here i know what it means to you i will take it over ill pay it ill get it done for you and he did
482252 if youre afraid of a few rats read the book of revelation
482253 to ask them to kill animals is to ask them to do the worst possible thing you could do
482254 they really have a very strong feeling as far as all creatures are pretty much fair and have a right to live and exist its their religious belief not to harm anything gods creatures
482255 i go to church all the time okay people like that make us look bad you know what i mean
482256 its a form of hoarding some people will collect unnecessary items of any kind and some people will collect animals
482257 are living in their own little world that theyve constructed and these animals are serving an important role in that world these animals provide something very different than what they do for a typical pet owner
482258 and they had been such a source of comfort theyre a therapy and its just their unconditional love their savage loyalty and their sweet forgiveness are traits that human beings could really really follow and adopt
482259 want something to eat and theyre not all going to fit in that house they are somewhat territorial and it could be time for them to disperse its probably time to venture into the neighbors yard
482260 they wouldnt let anyone inside and were strictly informed about the laws of privacy we cant step on our tiptoes to look over a brick wall thats a violation of privacy it would be thrown out of court
482261 there are lower level search warrants that would apply in this area
482262 amazing its like a monumental crack that these women are falling through
482263 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
482264 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
482265 why should i get beat up why should anybody get beat up
482266 that person was not only not complying but gripping in a death grip that baton thats a danger to the police officer
482267 without question the force utilized to effectuate that arrest was far beyond anything that was justified
482268 with all the people around youre never sure what the outcome is going to be

482336 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that you know i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy

482417 do you want to take a picture like this by your own self
482418 this is a kamikaze mission and guess whos nose diving the plane
482419 i was told to sit here and make with the clickety clack on the keyboard
482420 i have a new engineer this year and trying to strike a rapport with somebody in a very intense season is somewhat difficult were definitely not working in unison yet youre never always going to be 100 percent comfortable with your car but you want confidence that in any given situation you can make the best happen thats what were lacking
482421 the thing now is to try to take as many points off helio as i can to some degree ill always support scott to make sure the team can win the championship but at the same time it would be nice to finish the season with a couple more wins
482422 im not glued to this type of car racing is really important to me
482423 we went to london and it was done on this beautiful estate that was picture perfect it was like a setting from a jane austin novel
482424 there are personal markings in counter strike called sprays as long as its a still image you can make it whatever you want sometimes you see lolcats and sometimes you see porn so when someone stops to look at the naked lady painted on the wall someone else comes up and knifes them
482425 this changes the relative meaning of death for the two of us for me dying will not penalize me in the way it penalizes them because i have almost no chance of improving my state i might as well take people down with me
482426 there will be no on screen violence in this product i dont see war as a game i dont find that amusing
482427 until then the three man crew will have to make do with a jury rigged system when they need to urinate
482428 while one of the crew was using the russian made toilet last week the toilet motor fan stopped working according to nasa since then the liquid waste gathering part of the toilet has worked on and off fortunately the solid waste collecting part is functioning
482429 the crew has used the toilet ont he soyuz return capsule but it has a limited capacity
482430 like any home anywhere the importance of having a working bathroom is obvious nasa spokesman allard beutel said
482431 think one person can change the world so do we
482432 serious concerns about the universitys ability to recruit and maintain high quality faculty fund raising and leadership
482433 is a great mid sized school in a fun city of the three colleges my kids went to i would have to say its my favorite
482434 you can rebook your flight ten times and they dont charge you anything you can use amex miles and if you buy a packet of five round trips you get free companion fares
482435 you can check two bags and you dont have to pay a fee for excess baggage in this day and age all the other airlines allow you to check just one bag
482436 i absolutely would not let my kids go to a school in a city that is not serviced by southwest
482437 before applying anywhere you should go to their website and see where they fly they have three nonstops a day to nashville wash u and penn are good universities but there is only one non stop to st louis and to get to philadelphia you have to stop or change planes in vegas
482438 through education based on the deep awareness of the heritage of our people towards tomorrows bright fatherland let us study not for the sake of personal gain but for the sake of learning let us not choose a career in thoughts of personal gain but choose a career based on our talents and aptitude such is my true fortune and tomorrows bright fatherland
482439 i sat down and did what generally one does after eating a lot of beans i finished up remembering to throw the toilet paper in the wastebasket as is done in costa rica to keep the pipes from clogging and pulled the gold plated handle nothing happened huh thats funny tried again nothing sh t
482440 this came from a great school that not only thinks you should get a life and move out of here but will also help you save the environment meet the dalai lama and win the nobel prize
482441 dont i have to win a nobel prize before i apply
482442 we are keeping a small number on the wait list just to respond to other wait list activity around the nation
482443 that crazy neurotic parent she should be reading about our hedge fund picks instead of worrying about missing hyphens
482444 how many kids are you sending to penn in the fall
482445 if our son attended your school would that help his chances for college
482446 if you girls would just shut up and listen youll get a 1600
482447 there is so much i want to try i might want to stop doing graphic arts and take a semester of photography then maybe ill do a year of speech and debate and a summer program in creative writing im going to run for student council and start a ping pong club and i want to take music composition kayak lessons and maybe even two languages french and ancient greek
482448 you cannot study all those things how would that look to the admissions committees at the colleges where youre applying in 2012 they want to see that you have just one passion two at the most top candidates choose something they love in third grade and stick with it
482449 but how am i supposed to have a passion now
482450 most fourteen year olds bound for selective schools have already won awards in their field of choice
482451 they know its a terrible idea to have more than a few interests so give it up
482452 but how am i going to know if i like something if i dont try it cant i be passionate about learning itself
482453 even if you are a neurotic parent who writes a satirical blog about the college admissions process
482454 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
482455 those who helped abetted and actively took part in the bombings were arrested
482456 we have been beating about the bush and we have been spending a lot of time sharing and listening to each other
482457 i would like to see if we can have some suggestions coming out from this conference from where you can go from here rather than simply talking about the things we have been talking about for years
482458 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
482459 educations purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one
482460 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall

482465 i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time but to give us a usable answer to our offers and stop dallying
482466 even the americans have visibly got involved and sent a negotiator for the first time
482467 it is all meant to demonstrate there really is a commitment to a diplomatic solution
482468 we would then suspend our efforts for sanctions and iran would suspend the expansion of its centrifuges its a clear offer that deserves a clear answer and a prompt one
482469 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
482470 man too may be somewhat responsible for the cooling trend the university of wisconsins reid a bryson and other climatologists suggest that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth

482473 there are worrying signs appearing in the united states where some locals are beginning to hoard supplies
482474 celebrate the achievements and reaffirm the values of a great organization
482475 let no individual section faction or group ever regard itself as greater than the organization
482476 our nation comes from a history of deep division and strife let us never through our deeds or words take our people back down that road
482477 people eat with their eyes they go through the line and they just load up and then sit down
482478 we thought it would increase the mess and the amount of cleanup to be done by dining hall staff
482479 if the kids have to very carefully portion out what they are going to eat they wont overload their trays and waste so much food
482480 defendant gillet outillage is a french company that makes hose clamp pliers it owns french and u s patents on the pliers design when gillet discovered that plaintiffs were selling similar pliers in the united states the company sued them for patent infringement but the lawsuit didnt go as well as gillet hoped the central district of california construed the patents claims narrowly at a pre trial markman hearing after that setback gillet dropped the suit which was then dismissed plaintiffs thereupon sued gillet and its lawyers and distributor claiming that gillets lawsuit was a malicious prosecution under california law and a violation of section 43 a of the lanham act and various california tort laws the district court granted summary judgment to defendants and plaintiffs appeal
482481 at gillets direction defendants lawyer prepared letters addressed to whom it may concern expressing the lawyers strong opinion that plaintiffs pliers infringed gillets patent and threatening that gillet would sue anyone who sold plaintiffs pliers defendant mayhew steel products inc gillets u s distributor forwarded these letters to its customers plaintiffs claim that the letters falsely stated that their pliers infringed gillets patent
482482 where lanham act claims and state tort claims are based on a defendants representation that someone infringed his patent plaintiff must show that defendants representation was made in bad faith
482483 p laintiffs offer no good reason why the bad faith requirement should apply only to the patent older and not also to those who act in concert with him to enforce his patent rights the purpose of the bad faith requirement is to permit the patent holder to assert his rights in good faith without fear that he might thereby violate the lanham act or state tort laws and to assert his patent rights a patent holder will often need help here for instance gillet relied on its lawyers to draft the letters it relied on its u s distributor to forward those letters to retailers because the defendants distributor and lawyer acted in concert with gillet the patentholder to recover against them plaintiffs must show that they acted in bad faith
482484 this system may be useful for the fly to navigate the olfactory landscape odor concentrations can change very dramatically and this is how they deal it
482485 we applied natural odors to the antennae odors that the fly would normally smell
482486 its like evolution has taken advantage of the system to adjust some channels up and down without affecting other channels
482487 if you want high sensitivity to co 2 then you can eliminate the feedback receptor in those neurons for other odors such as pheromone which is important for finding other flies a good tracking system is needed
482488 flies that lack inhibition in their pheromone sensing neurons often fail to find the female
482489 the control flies are strikingly different soon after they get accustomed to the new arena they zoom in on the female and immediately start courting her
482490 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs
482491 physicians will have little chance to correct or modify them unfortunately unexpressed concerns may contribute to breakdowns in communication which are frustrating for both physicians and patients
482492 knowing that older adults frequently dont voice all their concerns should help surgeons create opportunities for patients who are reluctant to bring them up
482493 you observe animals using the sense of smell to find food and you assume that this sensory modality must be important for survival but what we wanted to do is demonstrate it scientifically and in a rigorously controlled way
482494 if smell is so important then why are these odor blind animals doing as well as the animals that have a very good nose
482495 when the first cup of food was exhausted the animals with the normal sense of smell started to forage and very efficiently found that second cup much more so than those with the simple nose
482496 the odor blind animals didnt have a sense of smell to guide them
482497 its a simple demonstration that in times of plenty the sense of smell is irrelevant for survival
482498 but in times of scarcity when you really need to use that sensory modality to forage for food those without it have a competitive disadvantage
482499 heart failure patients experience high rates of hospital stays and poor outcomes
482500 by utilizing this model we can more quickly identify patients at risk for in hospital mortality who might benefit from more aggressive monitoring and intervention
482501 despite numerous advances in the treatment of chronic heart failure more work is needed to reduce the high risk of mortality for patients hospitalized for heart failure
482502 an essential next step is to study whether applying this risk prediction score will favorably impact patient care and clinical outcomes
482503 relay stations are much smaller than base stations and are much easier to deploy they can be fixed onto lamp posts for example
482504 they also should only cost around one fifth of the price as the intelligence is in the base station and unlike base stations they do not require a directed backhaul connection to the internet

482527 as your correspondent has learned a few days ago the khl sent the iihf a package of documents on six players so mr daly is absolutely not right it is expected that the iihf trial will last at least two weeks
482528 yesterday the same khl press service reported that a moratorium on the invitation of players from nhl clubs has been extended until august 15
482529 remains in a holding pattern as he waits for the u s consulate in moscow to process his work visa once he gets the document filatov is expected to fly to columbus the forward could be waiting several more weeks before the requisite paperwork is completed
482530 gaboriks agent was interested in the possibility of him playing for spartak
482531 but when they began to discuss salary with us they demanded an astronomical amount
482532 some people naively believe that all clubs in russia are willing to pay huge money
482533 for example we recently suggested the czech veteran rucinsky in his case we were apart several million dollars a year
482534 the wild plans to make an offer averaging in the 8 5 million range as of today if gaborik signed any contract that averaged more than 7 8 million hed have the fourth largest average contract in the nhl after superstars alex ovechkin sidney crosby and evgeni malkin and right above brad richards and vincent lecavalier
482535 i came because i hope to get more playing time here in the nhl i was not in the first two lines and i hardly produced
482536 we believe that this 36 year old guy has the potential to be a scorer
482537 look your heroes have signed another fighter he can pass and pay and score but that is forgotten i can assure the fans it will come as a surprise because simon knows how to play hockey
482538 many years to grow in order to overtake it but if the player goes to russia where he paid more money it is his right we just need to regulate the situation so as not to create conflicts in a vacuum
482539 the players will have less time to mess with hockey in the corners and young players will progress faster
482540 there is also a code in hockey that tough guys are obliged to respect when playing hockey
482541 jacques is not the first coach who hasnt liked what i bring to the table and hes probably not going to be the last
482542 youre not going to hang on to a 31 year old whos in and out of the lineup that plays eight minutes a game and makes 2 6 million
482543 if the khl allows radulov to play for salavat yulaev we will insist that the iihf rule the ufa club from the champions league
482544 there is a code in the game that tafgai are obliged to respect the playing of hockey

482575 im sure a fair number of you expected the via nano l2100 to come out ahead because it operates at 1 8ghz while the intel atom 230 runs at just 1 6ghz but there is more to it than the 12 5 difference in clock frequency the via nano processor is based on superior superscalar out of order architecture which is why it performs better than the intel atom processor the via nano processor beat the intel atom processor in every single performance benchmark we ran and that says a ton for the engineers centaur technologies who designed the nano processor

482595 all the times you called and i did not answer i was ignoring you

482605 i was just commenting on what wonderful technology youve given me to complete this mission
482606 you were demoted for a reason i am sorry that you are paying the price for it now but we cannot afford to break the oath for anyone no matter what the circumstances
482607 when ive convinced the baron to support us i want my old rank back
482608 hopefully your mission will be a success and we can afford to get you better equipped
482609 do not worry if the baron agrees to fight for us or even to simply offer financial backing then all will be forgiven
482610 roger i am going to disengage from active control of your mind and continue meditating so i can shield you from the baron should he prove to be hostile call me if you run into any banshees or other fey folk we dont think the host could afford to supply fey mercs to keep the baron in check but seeing as they hold dublin and iona anything is possible ill keep a slight mental monitor going though so if i sense anything i can warn you
482611 beat up one witch doctor and suddenly everythings a struggle
482612 are you alright i am picking up a slight disturbance in your mental balance to put it plainly youre talking to yourself again
482613 had to use an adreno buddy one of the ghouls got into the cookie jar and he had to be put down
482614 roger just remember that if a lycanthrope or a wraith hears you coming you wont hear them coming
482615 im gonna need a mental barrier against fear also increase my metabolism for the time being im gonna need to be a furnace in case it manages to touch me
482616 you will not harm the baron i am loyal i am loyal i am loyaaaaallllll
482617 im red ruin im trying to get him out of here
482618 not host not the black but the red red dead youll be dead soon but maybe
482619 no thank you i need to remain alive for now tell me where the baron is and i will do what i can to help him retake the castle
482620 your fear is delicious let me taste it and i will tell
482621 roger i am dropping the barrier take your voice box off line we dont want any errant screams attracting unwanted guests
482622 now i have the strength my mind is lucid but not for long i can create a portal to where they are keeping the baron i cannot go the necromancers that keep him chained they will surely banish me then i could no longer serve

482652 i dont use primary secondary terminology since i dont see my relationships as hierarchical
482653 for me sex is about energy so breathing and heart connection are more important than ejaculation
482654 im more sophisticated than the guy over there please sleep with me instead
482655 i see polyamory as being more about relationships and intimacy while swinging is just about sex and sex without intimacy is just not where im at right now
482656 im more sophisticated than the guy over there please sleep with me instead
482657 if you start seeing someone else and id feel unsophisticated just saying that im jealous then ill reinterpret one of our agreements until im able to say you broke it
482658 right now the most important things to me are building poly family and intentional community
482659 im getting concerned that i wont always be able to easily find new partners plus im tired of driving from place to place and oh yeah im more sophisticated than the guy over there so please sleep with me instead
482660 in our household the most important things are open communication and open process
482661 i dont feel that we communicate on the same level and that you arent supporting me emotionally
482662 im tired of you but it would make me seem less sophisticated and hence reduce my opportunities for further sexual relationships in this community to actually say that so bluntly so ill make this about vague failings on your part instead
482663 i want to reserve the right to veto each of your partners no matter how much they respect our existing relationships so that youre de facto limited to monogamy while i play the field
482664 i think that we should focus on each other for a while
482665 im having more trouble finding partners than you are time to clip your wings
482666 i want you to always feel ok telling me whats really going on in your life and asking for what you need in this relationship
482667 ask for what you need and express hurt feelings at your peril
482668 im not angry at you im angry at myself for not having recognized sooner that we werent right for each other
482669 im angry at you for not making my life perfect but rather than taking responsibility for setting and meeting my own goals i find it more satisfying to shift the blame to you while superficially appearing to do the opposite
482670 out of respect for our primary bond we normally only see other people together
482671 maybe this time ill finally get to have sex with two women at once omg omg omg that would be l33t
482672 i think we need to process the end of our relationship and get closure
482673 were through i just want to vent a little more so that i can feel a little more self righteous once you know its over too ok
482674 the idea of line marriage has always appealed to me
482675 the idea of having sex with people younger than me has always appealed to me
482676 so which conventions do you like to attend what kind of books do you like to read what are your spiritual beliefs and what is your ideal occupation
482677 which science fiction conventions do you like to attend who is your favorite fantasy author what form of neo paganism do you ascribe do and where in the computer industry would you like to work
482678 im needing to do some inner work and instead of dating anyone would rather just work on my relationship with myself
482679 im tired of you but since i dont have anyone else lined up right now i might as well get some mileage out of the personal growth angle
482680 well im only theoretically poly but i already have plenty of firmly held beliefs about how it could be done in real life
482681 swinging would be way too crass for me im more about relationships and emotional intimacy
482682 ive always wanted to go to new horizons could someone give me a ride there and guest me in as long as i dont have to ask publicly
482683 all of my partners are equally important to me and theyre all primary
482684 id rather not explicitly spell out what the heirarchy is but trust me youll know when you run into it
482685 once youve told me that were done fucking youll never hear a word from me again
482686 i intend to act like a snag sensitive new age guy and put as much pressure on you to put out as possible
482687 ive had to do a lot of work on that issue myself in my other relationships and id be glad to help you with it if you want
482688 ive tried blaming all my other partners for my shit and they wont put up with it anymore
482689 i really admire the way you are able to speak up for your boundaries in your relationships
482690 if im going to get you to sleep with me ill have to be a cagey manipulative bastard
482691 my other partners and i share a lot of interests but we do a lot of things separately too
482692 none of my current partners will let me have anal sex with them will you
482693 my partners and i follow our own unique spiritual path
482694 eh aku baru nimbrung nih di sini eh ada aku murid baru yang senang nulis

482730 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals

482742 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
482743 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

482771 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
482772 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
482773 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
482774 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
482775 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
482776 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
482777 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
482778 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

482866 the chances of getting him back on september 1st is zero
482867 had we had a little better feel or a little better read on that at every step of the way i would have said hello to him walking down the hall
482868 its a different world for him and i think it should be
482869 and i think that were going to be a benefactor of that

482871 try to throw the ball to the guy whos open that usually helps
482872 obviously his lifes changed 100 percent but hes the same guy a little bit more guarded maybe but for the most part hes the same guy
482873 at that point in time it was a situation where i felt like i had to have his back
482874 he had been tearing us up since weve been here

482883 trabajamos durante m s de dos meses con los parlamentarios de la comisi n de transporte de la c mara con los mismos parlamentarios que hoy est n haciendo conferencias de prensa y llegamos a un acuerdo amplio ellos bien lo saben estuvimos a muy pocas horas de firmar ese acuerdo hasta que como se al uno de ellos en su propia declaraci n les pusieron un freno de mano que impidi firmar el acuerdo
482884 ese freno de mano es una raz n pol tica por lo tanto mal se podr a decir que no hubo conversaciones
482885 como ha dicho el ministro cort zar ellos han cambiado de posici n varias veces en cierto momento eran cr ticos despu s acercaron posiciones con el ministro estaban a punto de firmar cuando intervinieron los senadores novoa y allamand se retractaron entonces no sabemos todav a cuando llegue el momento de firmar de verdad cu l va a ser su decisi n final

482889 llamo al ministro cort zar a que de una vez por todas no solamente sea un buen comunicador sino que tambi n un buen administrador del transantiago porque hasta ahora comunica muy bien pero administra muy mal
482890 queremos que el transantiago se solucione y eso es evidente pero que el ministro nos escuche nosotros hace tres meses atr s dimos 10 condiciones bueno las vamos a volver a plantear
482891 al final la gesti n de los gobiernos y de los ministros hay que medirlas por sus resultados y los resultados del transantiago son desastrosos
482892 el transantiago ha sido es y va a seguir siendo un desastre en la medida que el gobierno no haga reformas estructurales de fondo y mientras no se comprometa a darle una igualdad de trato a las regiones nosotros no estamos dispuestos a seguir perdiendo el tiempo

482900 it isnt necessarily that those warmer climes have become unattractive especially with so many baby boomers entering the time of their lives where theyd just as soon forego frost its really more a case of people deciding to stay put either because they cant sell their home for the price they want or cant sell it at all

482913 i dont know where he would have been as a freshman at florida state but hes really worked hard and gotten himself in shape when he got in our offseason program as ive been told he probably threw up the first 15 workouts just because he hadnt been in them hadnt worked hard right now he looks to me like hes physically ready to go will he be better in a year yes with more time in the weight room and more offseason work he is a phenomenal athlete and hes about where youd expect him to be maybe a little better
482914 with jeffs cottam situation and aaron douglas not being able to do everything hes going to get a lot of work were very hopeful for the best to me its an absolute no brainer hes done all he needs to do he certainly had a very legitimate reason to choose to transfer with his mothers illness i just dont see how it doesnt work out but i never fully understand everything that administrators do sometimes

482964 fran why she had a great time at the wedding as far as i know
482965 she is heart broken since raphael fell back into old habits
482966 and i really dont know that to do about it as long as raphael is a victim of his addiction i cant do anything about it and fran is right that she broke with him i talked to george about him but he told me he didnt give that shit to raphael because raphael cant handle it i think its raoul we all know how irresponsible he is
482967 he know how to get things and where but he know that he must not give it to people like raphael
482968 nothing raphael is a big boy and we have no right to tie him up in the dungeon of the imperial palace but as long as his addiction is stronger than his common sense we cant do anything to bring him and fran back together

482971 okay and then you dont need raphaels permission after all its about him
482972 do you think raphael is responsible enough to make such decisions who is stronger raphael or the devil in him
482973 and you think la mamma is able to perform exorcism on that devil in raphael i mean please roux

483093 the efforts of some very passionate aids activists are paying off in mexico with mercks announcement of significant price cuts on two of its aids drugs stocrin and isentress
483094 though there is still much to be done in the fight for affordable lifesaving aids drugs in mexico and throughout the world including further advocacy focusing on merck we commend merck today for instituting these double digit price reductions in response to activists pleas for lower prices as a means to increase access to antiretroviral treatment throughout mexico we want to ensure that people in need in mexico are not arbitrarily priced out of such lifesaving aids treatments and we will continue to vigorously advocate both government and industry for universal access to antiretroviral treatment
483095 merck will still charge 1 51 usd per patient per day for stocrin in mexico while the drug is available in brazil a country with a similar per capita income for roughly 50 cents per day we have challenged merck before for charging four times as much as they do in other latin american and middle income countries for drugs like stocrin steep pricing effectively makes these drugs all but out of reach for nearly all those living with hiv aids in mexico
483096 over the past year ahf and a growing coalition of aids activists here in mexico have undertaken efforts to make policy makers and the public at large aware of the imbalance in mercks policies regarding the pricing of its aids drugs as compared to how merck prices the same drugs in what are considered least developed countries we also need to continue to push merck on the registration and pricing of the three in one once a day combination therapy atripla to make certain that people in need in mexico and elsewhere have access to this lifesaving regimen
483097 this was the most difficult milestone in development of the falcon 9 launch vehicle and it also constitutes a significant achievement in us space vehicle development not since the final flight of the saturn 1b rocket in 1975 has a rocket had the ability to lose any engine or motor and still successfully complete its mission
483098 much like a commercial airliner our multi engine design has the potential to provide significantly higher reliability than single engine competitors
483099 we made a major advancement from the previous five engine test by adding four new merlin engines at once
483100 all phases of integration went smoothly and we were elated to see all nine engines working perfectly in concert
483101 we have not yet found traces of ammonium nitrate an fo is a high intensity explosive and had it been used the casualties would have been much higher here a low intensity explosive has been used intelligently to create panic and not kill people like in hyderabad and jaipur

483106 it is a do or die match for us and the boys are looking for a win it will be tough but we can win if we play to our plan
483107 everyone in my team knows his role i dont think the absence of one or two players will make any difference
483108 murali muttiah muralitharan will come to the party its just that in these couple of days theyve batted well against him
483109 when the indians batted first on that wicket keeping them to 329 was a brilliant effort the wicket was playing really well
483110 we had kumar sangakkara and malinda warnapura giving us a great start but we could not capitalise on that
483111 ideally if we had got a lead it would have been brilliant but i thought harbhajan bowled very well the previous day to pick up thilan samaraweera and tillakaratne dilshan and straight away put us on the back foot
483112 after that our target was to try and get close to the indian total which we fell short they got a good start again but we managed to pull them back its an evenly balanced test match if we can get a couple of early wickets tomorrow and put pressure on the indians
483113 even on the first day ajantha mendis turned the ball so did murali muttiah muralitharan and then harbhajan on the second day but you still need to put the ball in the right areas
483114 if you are really determined you can survive and get into a rhythm and its quite easy to score runs it is a good test wicket
483115 out of the first six batters harbhajan got five of the top order and that speaks for itself a few of our guys were a bit too cautious but you should give credit to harbhajan the way he bowled
483116 most of the guys got out to good balls not that they threw away their wickets
483117 india were batting cautiously as well as they were attacking at different times with murali we tried to get wickets early
483118 because of that he probably gave away a few loose ones and i brought him on with the new ball thinking that i can create an opportunity but it didnt happen and it was not ideal for him when you have a top spinner like him the batsmen tend to bat cautiously
483119 murali will come to the party its just that in these couple of days theyve batted well against him
483120 i have better stories than him i could totally do that

483196 does free speech tend to move toward the truth or away from it when does it evolve into a better collective understanding when does it collapse into the babel of trolling the pointless and eristic game of talking the other guy into crying uncle is the effort to control whats said always a form of censorship or might certain rules be compatible with our notions of free speech
483197 why inflict anguish on a helpless stranger its tempting to blame technology which increases the range of our communications while dehumanizing the recipients but while technology reduces the social barriers that keep us from bedeviling strangers it does not explain the initial trolling impulse this seems to spring from something ugly a destructive human urge that many feel but few act upon the ambient misanthropy thats a frequent ingredient of art politics and most of all jokes theres a lot of hate out there and a lot to hate as well

483202 i look in the mirror i see my hair is black
483203 if i were certain that i wasnt a terrible reporter he explained i would have laughed the suggestion off just as easily the willingness of trolling victims to be hurt by words he argued makes them complicit and trolling will end as soon as we all get over it

483212 anyway their soul goes off to heaven to a better place and thank god theyre out of this yucky world and so on but you dont say that you say that death is an enemy that has to be destroyed that god did not create death he created us for life and not for death he didnt create the world to be a cosmic cemetery whilring through space full of dead peoples bones he created us good and he saved us and redeemed us for life and death is bad not good it is not a liberation it is the eschatos echthros the last enemy to be destroyed by the power of god

483251 ill bet there arent any deer or antelopes playing around here either
483252 well on gallifrey we combine the two art forms quite adequately
483253 humans unlike timelords are not always to be taken literally when it comes to their art their songs their poems there is a difference you know between objective reality and what might be called poetic reality
483254 they exaggerate they they romanticise ah thats the word and especially appropriate when it comes to the artistic treatment of the american west they embellish its one of their more endearing qualities i find in fact ive been known to indulge in it myself from time to time
483255 romana the last house we passed was about five miles in that direction isnt that rustic enough for you
483256 this road is clearly designed for the use of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines
483257 and unless i am very much mistaken those are electrical power lines overhead hardly what might reasonably be called wild and you said thered be cowboys and indians
483258 frightful ruffians and they get very silly when they see pretty young ladies like you
483259 oh thats all right i do have a smattering of punjabi
483260 our timing is about a century out ill grant you
483261 and i dont think this body is designed for exposure to these levels of ultraviolet radiation
483262 we can go back to the tardis if you want
483263 i thought we were going for a stroll in the countryside new mexico in the springtime just smell that air
483264 i mean did anyone else see that tentacle or whatever it was
483265 we have made considerable progress in this latest series of experiments we will very soon be in a position to communicate and interact with these ultraterrestrial entities
483266 costly progress fifteen personnel killed or incapacitated some of them clawed their own eyes out rather than look at at that thing the ones who survived are being held in a veterans association mental ward in albuquerque completely and irreversibly insane
483267 you know perfectly well that the main caster in the ritual must remain within his own circle at all times it provides certain protections from these sorts of manifestations
483268 although that cant be much comfort for those of my men who are going to be spending the rest of their lives in padded cells
483269 they also knew the potential benefits that project blacklight could have for the united states
483270 frankly whatever the benefits may be of brokering an alliance with these entities im not sure theyre worth the obvious risks there are some things that men simply should not interfere with
483271 do you think for one second that the soviet union is not conducting research into this area even as we speak they secured the services of some of my former ahnenerbe colleagues in 1945 just as your government secured mine and do you think that they have any qualms about the risks mr vance remind the colonel of the report we received only last month from your central intelligence agency
483272 we have it on reliable authority that the kgb have been screening teenagers throughout the eastern bloc for potential extra sensory abilities apparently in the search for suitable subjects to participate in blacklight type experiments
483273 i am the scientific director of project blacklight it is my decision
483274 and as long as i have the support of the majestic group in washington
483275 your continued military command is more or less at my sufferance
483276 dont make me go over your head to majestic colonel
483277 mr vance we must make ready for the next series of tests have your teams ready to secure the new subjects as soon as they have been selected
483278 and we had another rustling expedition last night the locals are already talking how long before we draw some serious attention
483279 there appears to be some sort of commotion up ahead
483280 have you noticed how these sorts of things always seem to happen wherever we go
483281 we cant even go for a walk in the countryside without bumping into some sort of adventure
483282 i couldnt help noticing that you all appear to standing around looking at something so my friend and i decided wed join you
483283 you can tell even with the clothes and everything what gave it away
483284 just here on holiday we picked new mexico for the standing around and looking do you mind telling me what on earth the something is that were all standing around looking at
483285 cut up and drained of blood just like all the rest
483286 you cant just walk in here and start poking that thing its evidence now get back before i run you both in
483287 im the doctor and this is romana dont mind us were experts
483288 theres some sort of military research laboratory up there top secret
483289 i gave up working for the military quite some time ago
483290 good afternoon sheriff do you mind me asking but are you a cowboy or are you an indian
483291 in that case may i say namaste aap kaise ho
483292 excuse me maybe i should have said sat sri akaal kiddah haa tusi
483293 like a lot of folks around here this is the land the white folks made our grandparents settle on when they decided we couldnt be free any more maybe you think thats funny missy but i dont
483294 shes from belgium what do you make of that cow romana
483295 this animal has been mutilated with a surgical laser nothing else could make such clean cuts and cauterise them at the same time and it has indeed been drained of blood which is quite a feat considering they didnt spill any on the ground
483296 now wait up a minute what do you mean what year is it
483297 youve rather taken the words out of my mouth there sheriff which doesnt happen to me very often at all what do you know about aliens
483298 more goddamn flower children you two trippin on peyote or something
483299 i remember my granddaddy telling me about the spook lights that used to shine up there at night about the skinwalkers and the ghosts of the anasazi and the hole into the other world and all that just campfire stories but then about a year ago these cows and steers started showing up cut and bled dry and people said theyd seen lights in the sky when it happened i dunno about lights in the sky but i know that when those stories spread they attracted every kook and beatnik and hippie weirdo on the west coast they all drove out here into the desert to commune with the saucer people or what have you stayed for the peyote and their stupid rich white kid version of indian mysticism my boys serving his country with the marines at khe sanh so these white kids can lie around getting high anyway you look a bit old to be a flower child but i figure you and your girlfriend must be here for the same reason as them take my advice go back to haight ashbury or wherever you come from this place aint for you
483300 i suppose we do have a certain familiarity but i wouldnt go that far
483301 there are lots of things in the sky that have lights
483302 so the dead cows and the lights are there any other phenomena i should know about
483303 a couple of months ago a few hippie kids supposedly disappeared their friends reported them missing we searched for them didnt find anything probably went back to san francisco if they were lucky or if they werent wandered off into the desert when they were stoned and just died its easier than you think around here like i said this place aint for you now go home i warn you if i see you two hanging around here again ill bust you both for vagrancy
483304 did you think the sheriff was a bit offhanded about those missing people
483305 yes i did and whatever he may believe that cow was undoubtedly killed using non terrestrial technology
483306 hmm all of this warrants further investigation dont you think
483307 he has no idea of the importance of the work were doing here
483308 you know you really shouldnt talk like that about your commanding officer
483309 wringing their hands like old women worrying about the morality of it all
483310 we mustnt allow their fears to hold us back we must be unafraid to press on regardless of risk
483311 you knew that during the war you knew that it was a race against time that you couldnt worry about compassion or mercy you had an enemy to defeat
483312 and yet we still delayed too long and we lost which only underlines the importance of us completing blacklight as soon as we can before the ivans do otherwise they will destroy your country in the next war just as they destroyed mine in the last one
483313 look upon me with your thousand eyes guide me that i might serve you
483314 progress is slow for the time being you will have to manifest individually in bodily form
483315 the difficulty is in the vessels masters human bodies are too weak to contain your magnificence your manifestations through them can only be temporary an extraterrestrial corpus might suffice but the majestic group possesses only dead aliens not live ones
483316 we need to get mean jean schmidt out of congress

483544 i think this will push more scientists and hopefully the nih national institutes of health to really investigate the role of vaccines the role of mercury in autism because this case is so compelling
483545 epidemiological studies do not support the hypothesis that mercury in vaccines causes autism in the general population he tells webmd
483546 however there might be individual sporadic or rare cases in which patients have an adverse reaction after a dose of a vaccine that might exacerbate a pre existing condition
483547 there are no scientific studies documenting that childhood vaccinations cause or worsen mitochondrial diseases but there is very little scientific research in this area
483548 mitochondrial diseases are as prevalent as childhood leukemia however the national institutes of health devotes only 11 million a year to research into mitochondrial disorders and only about one third of that is earmarked for primary mitochondrial disease research many scientists believe unmasking the causes of mitochondrial disease may lead to possible cures for parkinsons alzheimers heart disease and cancer
483549 once mercury was removed from most childhood vaccines in 2001 autism cases did not decline
483550 after six months of essentially our daughter being a zombie and gone we knew this wasnt going away
483551 this was chronic and we had to come to grips with that
483552 i want to make it clear i am not anti vaccine
483553 vaccines are one of the most important if not the most important advance in medicine in at least the past 100 years but i dont think that vaccines should enjoy a sacred cow status where if you attack them you are out of mainline medicine
483554 to say there are no risks to any treatment is not true
483555 sometimes people are injured by a vaccine but they are safe for the majority of people i could say that with a clean conscience but i couldnt say that vaccines are absolutely safe that they are not linked to brain injury and they are not linked to autism
483556 i hope it will force government agencies to look further into what susceptibility factors are out there for children to develop brain injury after vaccination to look into the susceptibility factors of people at risk
483557 this is distressing for parents who watch their children suddenly deteriorate most are normal appearing until they exhibit signs of disease when placed under severe stress most do not have problems with autism
483558 if anyone said mitochondrial disease prevalence is higher among children with autism that is a hypothesis and there is remarkably little data to support it
483559 the truth is we dont know the prevalence of mitochondrial disease in the general population
483560 persons with mitochondrial disease dont necessarily have autism and persons with autism dont necessarily have mitochondrial disease
483561 just as with vaccines there is no scientific proof vaccinations cause mitochondrial deficiencies or autism
483562 we do recommend immunizations because many of the diseases we immunize against are associated with regression in children with mitochondrial disorders
483563 the aap leadership is seeking access to official documents in the case so medical experts can examine the science and consider whether it raises implications for other children the aap wants to ensure the public is provided accurate information about the safety and importance of vaccines our members are dedicated to the health of all children and urge parents to fully immunize their children
483564 were monitoring the safety of the hpv vaccine very carefully and the only adverse event that causes some concern is fainting after the vaccine
483565 higher rates of guillain barr have been associated with the swine flu vaccine and possibly with the meningitis vaccine menactra but it is no more common in those who get gardasil than in those who dont
483566 given all the questions about gardasil the best public health policy would be to reevaluate its safety and to prohibit its distribution to minors in the least governments should rethink any efforts to mandate or promote this vaccine for children

483568 today almost every thinking person agrees that the united states is off on the wrong path

483581 the aim is to create a medium for buyers and sellers of good and services to advertise their requests freely over the internet the reach of other free classified sites is limited because of the cost factor asiaslist com offers you the wide reach of a paid classifieds site without charging any fees for regular ads whatsoever
483582 asiaslist is a distinctly different service the site is easy to use and offers language support for users who dont speak english and you also get more replies per ad
483583 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed

483585 it painful to love someone it is fortunate to be loved
483586 we dont like the way you live your life so were going to help ourselves to 70 of everything you earn
483587 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
483588 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
483589 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
483590 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
483591 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
483592 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
483593 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
483594 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
483595 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
483596 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
483597 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
483598 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
483599 we have public involvement at home but since our settlement is new were still learning how to get major public involvement
483600 because their resources are short ours are short we find ourselves like them wearing many hats
483601 what i learned is theyve made a lot of progress over there
483602 throughout our sessions we repeated so many times we have that same problem

483608 no soy yo quien tiene que valorar c mo est n las negociaciones lo nico que puedo decir es que como futbolista no tenemos ninguna duda el resto son detalles del club que est trabajando y hay que ver c mo termina esto y hasta d nde llega
483609 sab amos desde el principio que iba a ser un tema complicado que no iba a ser f cil que un jugador como cristiano llegase al real madrid
483610 si le preguntas a todos los entrenadores todos te dir n que lo quieren es un jugador que todo t cnico quiere tener en su equipo un gran jugador con la exigencia del real madrid de ganar todo cada a o necesita a los mejores
483611 hay un inter s por este jugador pero no s si est firmado no tengo esa informaci n todav a
483612 he hablado con l y sabe perfectamente que es una parte importante de nuestro proyecto es un jugador fundamental no estamos pensando en ning n momento que se puede ir est trabajando hoy ha jugado sus primeros minutos en los que se ha visto lo que es robinho me parece perfecto que muchos est n interesados
483613 personalmente me habr a gustado que jugase en un primera en espa a hab a posibilidades pero hay que aceptar la decisi n del jugador sin duda el f tbol ingl s es tambi n una escuela importante para los j venes espero que avance y mejore en muchas cosas
483614 todav a nos cuesta coger un ritmo bueno durante muchos minutos del partido pero tenemos calidad para decidir hay que sufrir ante equipos m s rodados como el hamburgo que en dos semanas empieza su liga y se nota
483615 en mi poca de jugador particip en muchos torneos jugando d as seguidos es t pico de pretemporada sufrir con partidos seguidos y lo que no quiero es arriesgar en un torneo con jugadores que han llegado de la eurocopa y s lo han entrenado una semana
483616 wasnt ezra a woman it sounds like a womans name
483617 hey im god and i can do whatever i want
483618 let us help you build because like you we seek your god and have been sacrificing to him since the time of esarhaddon king of assyria who brought us here
483619 you have no part with us in building a temple to our god we alone will build it for the lord the god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia commanded us
483620 maybe god can actually use this person in this situation

483624 what has been done between the last attack and the latest atrocity to augment our ability to stop terrorists to root them out nothing
483625 i was in shock i could not move i could not do anything

483629 he knows what those are and we will move forward
483630 ken got overwhelmed with every single player coming up to him and telling him hello
483631 i think it was great that he came out today a lesser person would not have come out but he did and we cant wait to get him back
483632 i know hes extremely remorseful and he understands but if we want to be a good football team we have to win without him
483633 the first day that we were called was up in may we were in the san bruno mountain fire down by the airport and it got worse everyday since then
483634 were flying the st 2 right now to affect initial attack immediate response and increase safety for the pilots
483635 think about it they lose to us twice in the regular season they lose to green bay and they lose to new england and then they beat us all in the playoffs what are the odds of that thats got to be unheard of in nfl history but dallas doesnt think
483636 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
483637 a loud noise went off and everyone started ducking it sounded like a pop noise
483638 the deejay said it wasnt a gunshot just a bottle popping or the stereo making noise
483639 du bist im vergangenen jahr auf den weichen reifen gestartet und bist dann zweimal mit den super weichen gefahren w rdest du dies wieder tun
483640 nun das vergangene jahr ist nicht so wichtig um ehrlich zu sein lasst uns an heute denken
483641 du schaust dir nicht an welche strategie du vergangenes jahr verwendet hast
483642 nicht meine jene der anderen mein rennen war im vergangenen jahr ein desaster in diesem jahr sieht es viel besser aus und ich denke dass wir ein gutes auto haben wir zeigten im zweiten qualifying teil dass wir ein gutes auto haben
483643 was den dritten qualifying teil betrifft so war er in ordnung aber wir haben immer die frage der strategie weswegen wir bis morgen abwarten m ssen die runde war nicht perfekt denn ich kam auf der runde aus der box in jede menge verkehr und konnte meine reifen nicht vorbereiten so wie ich dies im ersten und zweiten qualifying teil tun konnte dies macht bei unserem auto leider einen ziemlich gro en unterschied aus
483644 aber nichtsdestotrotz denke ich dass es nicht allzu schlecht ist ich habe das gef hl dass wir eine gute geschwindigkeit ein gutes auto haben und ich bin zuversichtlich dass wir morgen mit den jungs k mpfen k nnen
483645 was ist mit der runde im zweiten qualifying teil die war einen tick schneller als michael schumachers rundenrekord aus dem jahr 2004
483646 das ist beeindruckend es war eine gro artige runde ich war einfach in der lage das maximum aus dem auto zu holen und das auto verf gte einfach ber eine gro artige balance ungl cklicherweise gilt das nicht allzu viel es z hlt einfach im n chsten qualifying nichtsdestotrotz bin ich immer noch zuversichtlich mit sicherheit werde ich morgen mein bestes geben um ein paar positionen gutzumachen
483647 kannst du etwas zu den neuen randsteinen an der schikane sagen welchen unterschied machen diese aus
483648 keinen unterschied ich kann mich daran erinnern dass ich vergangenes jahr den randstein sehr stark genutzt habe aber den ersten denn der zweite war sowieso nicht sehr wichtig diesen habe ich nicht so stark genutzt wenn du ihn zu sehr nutzt dann ber hrt er den unterboden und das hilft der rundenzeiten nicht ich denke also nicht dass dies etwas ver ndert
483649 du hattest im qualifying probleme mit deinen reifen und du hast gesagt dass du im dritten qualifying teile probleme damit hattest deine reifen aufzuw rmen ist das problem noch vorhanden
483650 nein mit sicherheit nicht in hockenheim hatten wir komplett andere probleme das hat damit nichts zu tun
483651 beide ferrari sind im ersten qualifying teil zweimal auf die strecke gegangen zun chst mit dem harten dann mit dem weichen reifen wurde dies gemacht um die beiden reifen zu bewerten
483652 wir tun dies bei jedem rennen es ist nicht das erste mal
483653 wie schwierig war es gewesen auf dieser strecke zu sagen welcher der bessere reifen f r dein auto ist
483654 ich bin mir ziemlich sicher dass der bessere reifen im qualifying f r mein auto der h rtere war denn ich war auf dem h rteren immer schneller der h rtere war bei mir immer konstanter ich war schon seit gestern hei darauf gewesen den harten im qualifying zu verwenden
483655 machst du dir sorgen aufgrund der dominanz der mclaren heute und w hrend der vergangenen zwei rennen
483656 man m chte immer vorne sein es ist kein fantastischer tag wenn du hinter deinem gegner liegst aber ich denke dass wir sehr hart arbeiten m ssen denn alle arbeiten tag und nacht und mit sicherheit m ssen wir alles geben ich bin mir sicher dass es die mentalit t meines teams ist tag f r tag von nun an bis zum ende der saison druck zu machen

483661 they wanted me to describe what this guy looked like
483662 up until wednesday night he seemed like a normal nice guy
483663 my friend had to work otherwise we would have still been there
483664 the team has done a fantastic job of continually improving the car over the past few weeks
483665 so im really proud of what weve achieved today its great to have locked out the front row with heikki weve been threatening to do it for a number of races so to achieve it at a track where its tricky to pass is really satisfying
483666 theres a great harmony within the team at the moment and we really deserved this i couldnt ask to be in a better position weve both got good strategies for tomorrow and well be challenging for the win

483690 people go away on vacation and they think theres no news being made but time and time again theres a big political story that breaks in august
483691 our decision was to forego tv ads in august to save money for the fall
483692 for the time being obama maintains the edge and has the strength of a majority of electoral votes his triumphant foreign trip allows him to continue to define this race but too many of these states are close and a sizable number are undecided or choosing a third party candidate so there is a lot of fluidity
483693 we should be able to deliver bottle hot water to dehydrated babies
483694 how much thought they had given the election how often they voted in the past and whether they plan to vote this fall
483695 mccains gains came because there was an even number of likely voters from each party last month the democrats had an 11 point edge
483696 it is simply not plausible that there would be an 11 point swing in party id among likely voters or that there is now an even split in the likely electorate between republicans and democrats
483697 its important to look at likely voters just to see under a scenario where mccain supporters are energized
483698 just to see a scenario where mccain supporters are energized
483699 i believe the fact that wright state received these photographs is a testament to our strong arts program and the galleries commitment to sharing contemporary art with the public
483700 of course its very exciting to add warhols name to the already impressive roster of artists we hold in our collection
483701 the program offers institutions that do not have the means to acquire works by warhol the opportunity to bring a significant number of photographs into their permanent collections while allowing those institutions that do have warhol in their collections to enrich the breadth and depth of their holdings
483702 the polaroid photos often served as source material for his silk screened prints and paintings
483703 because warhol used photo based screenprint stencils for his artwork he continually needed source images to reproduce most of his black and white photographs on the other hand were documentation of a time and place and their spontaneity a refreshing contrast to the staged polaroids

483780 from obamas repeated suggestion that hes running a racist campaign

483908 they see it as powerful way to introduce their audiences to site build it a small commission loss on the one side produces a much bigger commission gain on the other

483910 all our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them
483911 i always dreamt of working from home spending time with my family doing all the things i love now i do want to know how i earn myself a fantastic living how we work at home and how were able to have so much unbelievable fun in one word site build it
483912 i no longer work from home in the evenings and my income is constantly growing right now its double what i was making when i was standing behind a chair i do what needs to be done the most at any given time and the nature of website building is such that i can stop or take a break at any point and carry on when time allows i can work in my pyjamas and fuzzy slippers and switch from work mode to mommy caretaker to silly dance partner whenever the mood strikes
483913 what can i say life has never been better freedom is something that cant be paid for its not that i work less i probably work more than i ever did but i do it on my own terms it doesnt feel like work at all i am confident that i will never have to work for others again unless i want to
483914 and whats amazing above it all is that it doesnt seem like im selling people who contacted me have already been sold on my website they have already seen and felt my passion and know that they want what i have to offer when they call me their mind was already made up to make that purchase

483917 web 2 0 has been the playground of large companies which basically aggregate individuals and small businesses today small business owners have the simple powerful ability to increase content through others and use it to grow traffic and buzz tremendously
483918 small business has been shut out of web 2 0
483919 they are limited to blogging and using youtube and myspace to increase traffic and revenues in small ways now they become aggregators instead of aggregatees blogging pales because the site owner still has to create all that content with c2 visitors create original high value content a tremendous leveraging of time and results
483920 we studied all the major web 2 0 companies took the best eliminated the worst and then made it all simple to use
483921 you need an authority to maintain quality users of content 2 0 cannot continuously overwrite each other like at wikipedia they dont create profiles and gossip like at myspace and they do much more than just upload photos they build real value content which an owner can easily control and monetize that control is key
483922 content 2 0 is automated regulated high quality web 2 0
483923 like our flagship site build it the complexity under the hood is intense and under the hood is where it belongs our small business customers never have to look there they just focus on doing business
483924 small businesses have been the aggegatees for years the money is in being the aggregator now they can do it in their niches with quality and ease
483925 webmasters want to focus on creating sites not the tedium of site maintenance and promotion
483926 savvy webmasters will use sbi to host their sites the value of hosting has been declining which is reflected in dropping prices sbi on the other hand hosts your sites and promotes them too and the results speak for themselves 51 of our customers sites are in the top 6 of all sites on the net
483927 we built a web site http www imaginge com using sbi so that our regional sales office could be found in search engines as promised the site got listed in the big search engines and did so well that it receives more traffic than our companys main web site over the past 2 years our sbi site has been responsible for about 2 million usd in sales thats impressive roi considering the 299 price tag for sbi
483928 the old fashioned way by overdelivering on customer expectations by truly empowering them to do business successfully while leaving the technology and complexity to us to handle in the background where it should be

484054 bersegeralah kalian menuju amal shaleh karena akan terjadi fitnah fitnah seperti potongan gelapnya malam di mana seorang mukmin bila berada di waktu pagi dalam keadaan beriman maka di sore harinya menjadi kafir dan jika di sore hari dia beriman maka di pagi harinya dia menjadi kafir dan dia melelang agamanya dengan harta benda dunia

484072 ketika itu saya berada di tempat singgahnya abdurrahman bin auf di mina dan beliau disisi umar dalam sebuah haji yang merupakan akhir hajinya abdurrahman mengarahkan pertanyaan kepada saya apa pendapatmu jika kamu melihat seseorang datang kepada amirul mukminin umar bin al khaththab hari ini lalu ia mengatakan wahai amirul mukminin apakah anda melakukan sesuatu pada fulan yang mengatakan seandainya umar telah meninggal maka aku akan membaiat fulan demi allah tidaklah baiatnya abu bakr dahulu kecuali hanya sesaat lalu langsung sempurna maka mendengar laporan itu umar marah lalu mengatakan sungguh saya insya allah akan berdiri sore ini di hadapan manusia dan akan memperingatkan mereka dari orang orang itu yang ingin merampas urusan mereka maka abdurrahman mengatakan wahai amirul mukminin jangan kau lakukan karena musim haji ini menampung orang orang hina juga sesungguhnya merekalah yang akan lebih banyak dekat denganmu disaat kamu berdiri di hadapan mereka dan saya khawatir jika engkau bangkit dan mengucapkan sebuah ucapan lalu dibawa terbang oleh setiap yang terbang mereka tidak memahaminya dan tidak mendudukkan pada tempatnya maka tundalah hingga engkau pulang ke madinah karena madinah adalah rumah hijrah dan rumah as sunnah sehingga engkau dapat mengkhususkan ahli fiqh dan tokoh tokoh masyarakat lalu kamu katakan apa yang mungkin kamu katakan sehingga ahlul ilmi akan memahami ucapanmu dan menempatkannya pada tempatnya
484073 saya tidak mendapati orang yang lebih berhak terhadap perkara ini kekhilafahan lebih dari orang orang itu yang rasulullah meninggal dalam keadaan ridha terhadap mereka

484076 semestinya seorang pemimpin menjadikan seseorang yang menerangkan kepadanya tentang keadaan masyarakatnya disaat dia sendirian dan hendaknya orang tersebut orang yang bisa dipercaya amanah cerdas dan bijaksana
484077 hendaknya ahli syuramu adalah orang orang yang bertakwa dan amanah serta orang orang yang takut kepada allah
484078 akan tetapi wajib bersama penguasa itu ada seorang yang pantas berijtihad sehingga dia penguasa itu red dapat bertanya kepadanya dalam permasalahan hukum
484079 wajib bagi para pemimpin untuk bermusyawarah dengan para ulama dalam hal hal yang tidak mereka ketahui dan pada perkara agama yang membuat mereka bingung juga bermusyawarah dengan para pemimpin perang pada urusan peperangan dengan tokoh masyarakat pada urusan yang berkaitan dengan maslahat masyarakat dan dengan para menteri dan wakil wakilnya pada perkara kemaslahatan negeri dan kemakmurannya
484080 para ulama berkata kriteria orang yang diajak musyawarah jika dalam perkara hukum hendaknya seorang ulama dan agamis dan jarang yang seperti itu kecuali orang orang yang berakal oleh karenanya al hasan mengatakan tidaklah akan sempurna agama seseorang kecuali setelah orang yang bertakwa dan amanah serta orang yang takut kepada allah
484081 syarat syarat yang harus ada pada mereka ada tiga pertama keadilan yakni keshalihan agamanya dengan berbagai syaratnya kedua ilmu yang dengannya dia dapat mengetahui siapa yang berhak menjadi pemimpin dengan syarat syarat kepemimpinan ketiga ide yang bagus dan bijak yang dengan itu dia bisa memilih yang paling pantas untuk menjadi pimpinan
484082 jika allah mengatakan kepada rasul nya padahal beliau adalah orang yang paling sempurna akalnya paling banyak ilmunya dan paling bagus idenya maka bermusyawarahlah dengan mereka dalam urusan itu maka bagaimana dengan selain beliau
484083 dan urusan mereka diputuskan dengan musyawarah dan mereka menafkahkan sebagian yang kami rizkikan kepada mereka
484084 tidaklah sebuah kaum bermusyawarah di antara mereka kecuali allah akan tunjuki mereka kepada yang paling utama dari yang mereka ketahui saat itu
484085 diriwayatkan oleh al bukhari dalam al adabul mufrad dan ibnu abi hatim dengan sanad yang kuat
484086 dan pasti nabi bermusyawarah pada hal hal yang belum ada nash atau ketentuannya dari allah dimana tidak boleh bagi beliau melakukan musyawarah pada hal hal yang telah ada ketentuannya dari allah dan ketika allah tidak mengkhususkan urusan agama dari urusan dunia ketika memerintahkan nabi nya untuk musyawarah maka pastilah perintah untuk musyawarah itu pada semua urusan
484087 wahai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kalian mendahului allah dan rasul nya dan bertakwalah kalian kepada allah sesungguhnya allah maha mendengar dan maha mengetahui
484088 maka abu bakar tidak memilih musyawarah jika beliau memiliki hukum dari rasulullah
484089 seorang hakim pemimpin diperintahkan untuk bermusyawarah karena seorang penasehat akan mengingatkan dalil dalil yang dia lalaikan dan menunjuki dalil dalil yang tidak dia ingat bukan untuk bertaqlid kepada penasehat tersebut pada apa yang dia katakan karena sesungguhnya allah tidak menjadikan kedudukan yang demikian diikuti dalam segala hal itu bagi siapapun setelah nabi

484092 syura terjadi karena perbedaan pendapat maka seseorang yang bermusyawarah hendaknya melihat perbedaan tersebut kemudian melihat kepada pendapat yang paling dekat kepada al quran dan as sunnah jika ia mampu lalu jika allah membimbingnya kepada yang allah kehendaki maka hendaknya ia ber azam bertekad untuk kemudian melakukannya dengan bertawakkal kepada allah dimana inilah ujung dari ijtihad yang diminta dan dengan inilah allah perintahkan nabi nya dalam ayat ini ali imran 159
484093 tidaklah allah mengutus seorang nabi dan tidaklah menjadikan seorang khalifah kecuali ia akan punya dua orang kepercayaan salah satunya memerintahkan kepada yang baik dan menganjurkannya dan yang lain memerintahkan kepada yang jelek dan menganjurkan kepadanya maka orang yang terlindungi adalah orang yang dilindungi oleh allah
484094 bahwa abu bakr jika mendapati sebuah masalah maka beliau melihat kepada kitabullah jika beliau beliau mendapatkan sesuatu yang memutuskan perkara itu maka beliau putuskan dengannya dan jika beliau mengetahuinya dari sunnah nabi maka beliaupun memutuskan dengannya bila tidak beliau ketahui beliau keluar kepada kaum muslimin dan bertanya kepada mereka tentang sunnah nabi pada perkara yang tersebut dan bila hal itu tidak mampu menyelesaikan maka beliau panggil tokoh tokoh kaum muslimin dan para ulama mereka lalu beliau bermusyawarah dengan mereka

484099 saya tidak mendapati orang yang lebih berhak terhadap perkara ini kekhilafahan lebih dari orang orang itu yang rasulullah meninggal dalam keadaan ridha terhadap mereka

484108 jika kamu berkata bahwa raja raja penguasa di masa ini tidak seperti raja raja lalu bahwa rakyat sekarang pun tidak seperti rakyat di masa lalu

484320 there better be a guy who really impresses me when camp rolls around because itll really really bother me then
484321 but the difference between practice and games is theres not a lot of pressure hes looking good so far but you really cant gauge until crunch time down by two with two seconds left those are kicks jason elam used to make
484322 i dont want him to do bad because jasons not here
484323 dont get me wrong i wish we could have kept jason but we didnt so lets move on
484324 i totally agree its until i do it in the game
484325 i think it was really big for me because of all the questions
484326 and i think the biggest kick for me was the last one in the two minute they said we were down by one with three seconds on the clock and if i hit it we win if i miss it we lose that was a huge kick
484327 i kind of liked the last one when we put all the pressure on him game winning field goal three seconds left but hes been doing that pretty consistently since hes been here so it doesnt really surprise anybody but its sure nice to see him do that in his first live two minute drill
484328 you just watch him kickoff hes kicked it10 yards out of the end zone
484329 his length is probably 75 78 yards and he doesnt kick any harder he has the same swing consistently hopefully he can make the ones inside 45 and every once in a while depending on the situation the guy gets a chance to attempt one of those but usually thats at the end of the half or the end of the game
484330 theres no way to really learn something and get it through your head without actually doing it

484348 should i use my invisibility for evil or to fight crime
484349 when you hear the show its not so much just about a train its about a train ride a lot of its about belief it signifies what the troopers are we were out in 2006 we came back last year and this year were much stronger than we were last year we just have to believe in ourselves
484350 its about taking the audience through the past of the troopers
484351 you take the train from what you feel like when you first see the troopers and come full circle all 50 years with ghost riders in the sky at the end its a lot of fun its a great show
484352 im a third generation trooper because my uncle marched my parents marched ive always wanted to do this ever since i was 10 and so for six or seven years ive been working really really hard i finally made the corps and its just everything i expect and so much more you cant get an experience like this anywhere else
484353 we all knew that this was going to be a great 50th year every time that i go onto that field i just feel everyone in the crowd knows that we are americas corps the score doesnt really matter it really comes down to how the crowd responds to us and when we hit that sunburst they just stand up and roar and its unbelievable and thats the reason why i i wanted to be a trooper
484354 everything that the troopers stand for has been given to me every single day since ive been here i marched somewhere else last year and theres more pride in this one corps than i have ever felt anywhere else this place is like my family now definitely i really cant see how anybody can march anywhere else its probably the best thing ive ever done

484358 mi esposo fue el que trajo el sida a casa
484359 mi esposo ya tiene muchas discapacidades est ciego en silla de ruedas pero lo quiero l es el hombre de la casa l es el que nos mantiene mi hija una vez le pregunt c mo adquiri el sida y l tuvo que responderle merec a esa respuesta ese sentimiento de culpa es permanente y s lo con mucho amor lo hemos manejado
484360 sin que nos di ramos cuenta y por decisi n propia
484361 karen va a las escuelas a dar pl ticas a conferencias y le dice a la gente que lo nico que ella quiere es que la amen que la respeten que no la discriminen

484364 en los hoyos que fall me pude recuperar en mi segundo tiro metiendo buenos putts y eso me dio buen ritmo en mi juego entonces estoy feliz porque fue un d a complicado y estoy muy contenta con mi score
484365 por suerte para m la gente no est eligiendo un orador motivacional washington est lleno de oradores talentosos y el senador obama es uno de los mejores para compartir un rato
484366 el gobierno es demasiado grande y l quiere acrecentarlo los impuestos son demasiado altos y l quiere incrementarlos el congreso gasta demasiado y l propone m s necesitamos m s energ a y l est en contra de producirla y necesitamos finalmente ganar en irak y el quiere perder
484367 con una agenda como sta la destreza para la ret rica es muy buena pero buenos discursos no son todo en la pol tica el buen juicio importa tambi n
484368 y una diferencia es nuestra buena voluntad de romper con nuestros propios partidos pol ticos cuando el principio y la sensatez lo exigen
484369 me opuse a eso y habl por la nueva estrategia que nos ha salvado de una derrota catastr fica en medio oriente
484370 esto suced a cuando el senador obama hablaba como si irak fuera una causa perdida confiado de que la acci n fallar a y pidiendo un retiro inmediato de nuestras tropas sin importarle cuales ser an las desastrozas consecuencias
484371 he visto la guerra de cerca conozco sus terribles costos y como presidente voy a terminar esta guerra gan ndola
484372 cuando mi propio partido result ser apenas tan financieramente irresponsable como el parido oponente gastando imprudentemente y dejando m s deuda para que tus hijos las paguen
484373 obama dice que l aumentar impuestos solamente sobre los ricos pero en el senado vot por incrementar impuestos que han afectado a quienes llevan a casa apenas 32 mil d lares al a o
484374 conservar imposiciones fiscales actuales bajas y a cortar otras no porque quiero hacer m s rico al rico pero porque las imposiciones fiscales bajas mantienen trabajos en estados unidos o crean otros
484375 el senador obama dice que quiere autonom a energ tica pero no apoya nada que sirva para esa meta se opone a la nueva perforaci n dom stica se opone a la energ a at mica y quiere agregar impuestos a los productores de carb n

484456 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively and help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world
484457 the determining factor in securing the success of the olympic games is to work vigorously to promote the olympic spirit featuring friendship solidarity and peace
484458 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly
484459 we need to ensure that our friends from the five continents can further enhance their mutual understanding and deepen their friendship during the games
484460 that the olympic games will be held in china a country that accounts for one fifth of humanity shows the trust placed on china by the world and is itself a contribution by china to the world
484461 the beijing olympic games belongs to the chinese people and more importantly also belongs to the people from around the world
484462 we pay close attention to raising the level of our people in terms of civility we have launched a nationwide campaign among 400 million chinese children and teenagers concerning the olympic education
484463 we work vigorously to encourage the chinese people to be gracious courteous warm friendly and hospitable hosts for the games
484464 at the same time as constantly deepening reform of the economic system and achieving sound and fast economic and social development we will continue pursuing comprehensive reforms including reforms of the political system
484465 continue expanding socialist democracy and developing a state of socialist rule of law
484466 the current dream of the chinese people is to accelerate building a modern country realize the great renaissance of the chinese nation and with the peoples of the world seek peaceful progress amicable co existence and harmonious development
484467 it is only inevitable that people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues
484468 and i think in this context we should enter into consultations on an equal footing to narrow our differences and expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
484469 i dont think that politicizing the olympic games will do anything good to addressing any of the issues
484470 and i think such an attempt also runs counter to the spirit of the olympic games and goes against the shared aspiration of people from across the world
484471 at the end of the day such an attempt will also undermine the olympic movement
484472 on the eve of your trip to china to attend the 2008 summer olympic games the human rights situation in china and tibet is worsening and new restrictions are being imposed on international journalists as they attempt to cover the olympic games
484473 the olympic charter states that the goal of the olympic games should be to promote
484474 in exchange for the privilege of hosting the olympic games the chinese government made commitments regarding freedom of the press human rights and the environment
484475 the recent dialogue between the chinese government and representatives of the dalai lama did not result in any progress
484476 on the international front the chinese governments policies of supporting the genocidal regime in sudan and the military junta in burma run counter to the interests of peace and stability in the world
484477 your recent meetings with chinese dissidents at the white house are to be commended however your participation at the opening ceremony of the olympics will send a signal to the chinese people and the international community that could be misperceived as your approval and that of the american people for the draconian policies of the chinese government therefore it is essential that you unambiguously speak out for human rights and meet with the families of jailed prisoners of conscience while you are in beijing
484478 in disregard of chinas firm opposition the us house insisted on adopting the resolution proposed by a handful of anti china congressmen which has fully exposed their ulterior motives to politicize disrupt and sabotage the beijing olympic games
484479 to hold a successful olympic games is a century cherished dream of the chinese people and also the shared aspiration of people all over the world we are fully confident that we can make the beijing olympic games a high level sports event with distinguishing features under the joint efforts and support of the olympic family we urge a few anti china forces in the us congress to make the right judgment and change their course to avoid further harming their images
484480 first of all its a great opportunity to be part of the games
484481 this is a once in a hundred year thing though i cant compete in the field as an athlete i can give my heart as a volunteer give my passion to offer my service to the spirit of the olympics is very important
484482 there is no contradiction between chinese attitudes and the spirit of the olympics
484483 talk dirty and smash the dishes when they are invited to a party
484484 they are collective redemption for the national suffering of the past century
484485 the cultural revolution generation that is now in charge have a sense that they were not well educated
484486 they hope to use the games to shape the next generation so that they are better prepared to take up their role in the world community
484487 in general i think the outside world doesnt realize that the 2008 olympics are being used to press chinas government to do things for the chinese people
484488 consequently chinese leaders have for decades now used big events to accelerate change and get things accomplished this is not just true for the 2008 olympics its been done for years and years foreign reporters keep making a big deal of beijings olympics related politeness and anti spitting campaigns but those campaigns are decades old they were certainly around in the 1980s i was here right before the united nations fourth world conference on women in 1995 and at that time beijing was doing similar things there were campaigns to improve the politeness of taxi drivers to curb spitting and to improve public health and hygiene just before the 1990 asian games disposable chopsticks were finally adopted citywide in beijing restaurants in china events are often agents for change its just that the olympics are bigger
484489 the government has really pushed forward both environmental protection and olympic education in the context of beijing olympic education has meant training chinas next generation to be international many young chinese have been trained via beijings olympic volunteer programs
484490 besides internationalism the olympic ideals most emphasized in china with respect to the 2008 games have been friendship understanding unity and peace olympic education here has been aimed at two distinct groups volunteer college students and schoolchildren the government has invested a lot in the teaching of the games in beijing primary and secondary schools basically the idea is to teach international friendship and world peace through the olympic games while also preparing young chinese people for the world here in beijing the history of the olympics is taught in a way that emphasizes first the games western origins then chinas slow incorporation into the olympic movement and finally chinas ascendance to its place as an equal partner in that movement with these 2008 games its not only olympic history its a narrative of chinas relationship with the outside world as well

484606 strikes a deep chord among us because god has entrusted to us the ministry of reconciliation and the catechism contained in our book of common prayer clearly states that the mission of the church is to restore all people to unity with god and each other in christ
484607 we pursue the mission of reconciliation through prayer and worship proclaiming the good news in christ promoting justice peace and love in the episcopal church we hold evangelism and social action as two wings of our missionary enterprise the proclamation of gods saving act in christ characterizes our liturgical life and the pursuit of the local and global actions on the millennium development goals mdg has become our first priority as a church

484611 in a world where history has been dominated by the anglo saxon male from the western industrialized countries the disenfranchised minjung oppressed class and women have suffered inexplicable agony sexual exploitation and death within korean cultural tradition han has been used to refer to the particular experience of traumatic victimization that an individual is enabled to adequately express and forced to bear within themselves an act of violence committed against them without a distinctive perpetrator who can be called to account the miyalhalmi dance depicts the tragic suffering of an abused wife who after her death came back as a ghost not in order to avenge her murder but to trouble the living in an unjust society so that they would struggle together and work for justice

484637 one of my favorite bloggers is lindsay schnell from sports illustrated and according to lindsays latest blog there are way too many olympic sports to keep track of do we really need all those sports rhythmic gymnastics we already have gymnastics why do we need to add ribbon twirling to it and create a whole new event im not saying i dislike rhythmic gymnastics but i think if you wanna see an impressive athlete watch some of those gymnasts doing backflips on a four inch beam thats impressive do we really need to be training anyone whos not in law enforcement how to aim properly another olympic sport that i actually like to play but i dont know why its in the olympics badminton if thats an olympic sport extreme dodgeball should be one too and it would be a lot more fun to watch on tv and number one on the sports illustrated list of sports that shouldnt be in the olympics racewalking if you dont know what im talking about google racewalking on youtube then explain to me why theyre getting rid of softball but keeping racewalking in the olympics

484643 in this farewell to the captains ricardo rivera and alberto mancini we entrust you with this olympic dream with the same responsibility that you have already shown in previous games athens 2004 for luli and sydney 2000 and athens 2004 for caio
484644 the argentinian tennis association says goodbye to you with the hope of a great performance and we thank you for wear once again with pride the argentinian shirt
484645 we hope to have a good time at this olympic games it will be a tough tournament but the expectation is to bring a medal because there are very good players in single and doubles
484646 in doubles usually couples are made with players from different countries therefore to form a good pair of doubles for the games is quite possible we have a great chance with david nalbandian and guillermo ca as and augustin calleri and juan monaco because both team have chance to make it far
484647 it is nice to be in the olympic village with athletes who are legend and you can be close to them

484659 recent events had made it difficult and have to be addressed
484660 this is a very important occasion not just a party
484661 we live in a hypocritical society even if people dont say they dislike you for being gay they never quite accept you
484662 it is about showing that we are here that it is time that lesbian women who walk hand in hand in the street are not gawked at or spat on as happened to a friend of mine
484663 we are here to show that being a pink family is ok
484664 the parade serves a dual purpose to celebrate that we can be who we are and that we can do it in the open and to be visible building acceptance of homosexuality
484665 we are here for the party but also for the struggle
484666 the number of incidents of discrimination and of violence against gay people has increased in the past year
484667 it is time to stop talking about tolerance and focus instead on acceptance of sexual differences in amsterdam
484668 as gay people we still get the feeling that we want to be more open but it is difficult to do so in the workplace on the sportsfield
484669 society still expects of gay people to behave normally society needs to start accepting that we add value through our differentness

484707 biofuels may deliver significant environmental and economic benefits including lower carbon emissions
484708 under the federal governments carbon pollution reduction system as with the eu and new zealand schemes consumption of biofuels is zero rated that means biofuels do not attract any charge
484709 the government is also proposing to provide funding under the climate change action fund for research and rapid commercialisation of low emission fuel sources this increases the incentive for our industry to develop drop in biofuels as quickly as possible
484710 we plan to test fly a 747 this year using the nut to power one engine
484711 we would not do it if it meant replacing food crops or forests for fuel nut plantations it has to be socially acceptable
484712 if it does work as hoped it would be a great alternative it releases less co2 when used and it takes in co2 when it is growing
484713 we are confident our hard work with partners like boeing together with efforts of many of our peers will see a step change sooner than many people realise
484714 this fundamental shift in fuel options should be embraced by the industry and we aim to see at least 10 per cent of our total annual needs coming from environmentally sustainable fuels by 2013
484715 it costs us 225 000 in fuel to fly a 747 from los angeles to auckland but only 165 000 to fly a 777 on the same route

484725 im convinced leonid was shot down and killed in the war and that he was neither a captive nor collaborator of the germans

484737 for all the convenience and clarity of e mail it can be perilous for a clinician as part of the written record of patients treatment it can be subpoenaed just like chart notes in the unfortunately common event of legal action not just that but e mail must comply with the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa which has complex rules to safeguard patient privacy and confidentiality your psychiatrist could not for example send you a reassuring message about your recent lithium blood level unless you e mailed first and specifically asked for it still being an impatient person i love the speed of e mail but being a psychiatrist i am leery about the quality of information it conveys how can i tell whether my patient is being humorous sarcastic or ironic smiley faces are no substitute for the real thing

484889 caicedo is the missing link of the lost boom he is the first enemy of macondo i do not know if he committed suicide or maybe was killed by garc a m rquez and the dominant culture of those times he was less the rocker that the colombians want and more an intellectual a super genius tormented nerd he had imbalances anguish of living he was not comfortable with the life he had problems to stay on his foot and he had to write in order to survive he killed himself because he saw too much

484893 this is a unique tale needing a unique approach and bringing f bio and gabriel into the family of hellboy artists is really exciting to all involved
484894 their work is amazing and were giving them an epic gothic tale a moody and shadowy nightmare unlike anything theyve done and darker scarier and more mysterious than anything weve done in such a long format

484944 its all over the internet myspace is a good tool
484945 it was not that hard to get product they almost threw it in our face
484946 some people didnt come because they didnt want to be hassled it definitely affected the fest
484947 if you set up this type of thing at other festivals like rock fest youd see similar numbers of arrests and citations
484948 for them to say drugs are common at the fests is blowing whatever information they have way out of proportion theyre judgmental and biased
484949 so despite all that the police had to hassle us

484972 we have not had any discussion or agreement of the so called timeline of two weeks
484973 heute bin ich ganz zufrieden es ist viel besser gelaufen als gestern und am ende war ich schneller als mike conway nat rlich ist es hier schwer zu berholen aber ich will nicht klagen
484974 es war sicher das schwierigste rennen im jahr aber ich hatte keine probleme mit der hitze
484975 ich habe einen guten start erwischt und einen gegner berholt aber dann habe ich es in der ersten kurve au en versucht dadurch habe ich wieder pl tze verloren dann war ich auf p12 anschlie end habe ich auch durch die boxenstopps wieder ein paar leute berholt
484976 ich hatte einen guten start hatte schon buemi und yamamoto berholt dann jedoch als grosjean ein problem hatte musste ich in runde zwei grosjean ber die au enlinie ausweichen ich kam in den dreck und dadurch sind drei oder vier fahrer vorbeigekommen
484977 es war schwer denn physisch ist diese strecke sehr schwierig wir waren sehr konstant im rennen doch ich hing das ganze rennen hinter buemi
484978 wir konnten reagieren wenn etwas schief geht und das haben wir auch
484979 wir waren sogar eher zu fr h als zu sp t dran f r das zweite outing
484980 einerseits waren bourdais und fisichella vor mir und ich h tte keine freie strecke gehabt andererseits waren die reifen nicht mehr gut genug
484981 ich w rde mich mehr freuen wenn wir die konstanz ber das jahr hinweg reinbringen k nnen als wenn wir hier ein gutes einzelresultat einfahren
484982 ich bin zufrieden aber deswegen muss ich keine freudenspr nge machen
484983 so habe ich meine reifen nicht auf temperatur gebracht und war sogar langsamer als auf gebrauchten reifen
484984 das ziel war eine zeit von 1 21 700 minuten zu erzielen am ende waren wir sogar um eine zehntelsekunde schneller
484985 ich bin nicht zu 100 prozent zufrieden mit meiner session
484986 das war schade nur ein paar hundertstel haben mir gefehlt
484987 ich konnte mit neuen reifen an den start gehen weil ich am freitagnachmittag nicht gefahren bin zu beginn fuhr ich richtig schnell meine pace war schier unglaublich
484988 meine reifen waren schon nach 15 runden am ende aber auch ohne gummi musste ich so schnell wie m glich fahren
484989 auch wenn ich immer ber dem limit war habe ich das geschafft ich habe jede einzelne runde gepusht am ende ist mir ein gutes ergebnis gelungen
484990 endlich hat mal ein start geklappt schlie lich habe ich es vorhergesagt
484991 wir hatten heute das schnellste auto au erdem war es sehr konstant wir sind zufrieden mit dem zweiten platz
484992 nach einem guten start habe ich die erste kurve etwas zu sp t angebremst deswegen hat meine hinterachse blockiert und die beiden campos fahrer konnten vorbeischl pfen
484993 aber was petrov gemacht hat war nicht sehr fair er hat mich abgedr ngt und dabei meinen fl gel besch digt
484994 selbst als ich hinter ihm war lag mein auto sehr gut lucas hat sich ein paar mal verbremst und mich eingeraucht aber ein richtiger fehler ist ihm nicht unterlaufen
484995 ich hatte einfach eine bessere position in der ersten kurve und kam an andreas zuber vorbei dabei war mein start gar nicht so berauschend

485017 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
485018 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
485019 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
485020 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
485021 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
485022 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
485023 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
485024 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
485025 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
485026 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
485027 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
485028 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence

485077 both leaders expressed their disappointment that a breakthrough in the negotiations was not reached this week in geneva particularly given how close trade ministers came to reaching an agreement
485078 president bush and president lula expressed their continuing commitment to reach an agreement in the doha round negotiations and their desire for the united states and brazil to work together in developing a strategy to advance the negotiations
485079 there were some words shared and we went out to the dance floor

485081 that can be good because you can get a deeper sense of a person on a social networking profile than you can on a dating profile
485082 social networking sites are usually used fairly frequently by their users so you get a truer picture of who the people on the site are but there is a negative side too
485083 people tend to play the profile they learn everything they can about a person and then bring it up on their date in order to be more likable that can lead to a distorted reality of who the person behind the profile really is
485084 he was well read well educated everything in his profile was spelled correctly
485085 he had an eclectic taste in music and movies and didnt take himself too seriously
485086 once i arrived he had to sneak me through the back stairs of his flat and up to his bedroom because he lived with his parents and they were asleep
485087 i was completely mortified but figured we had good chatting chemistry so i could at least give him the benefit of the doubt
485088 once he set up the movie he didnt say a word to me and i was so bored i had to leave because i was falling asleep
485089 for some people inept at communicating in person online meet and greets are much easier
485090 they can be themselves they have time to think about how to respond to someone approaching them
485091 but in person theres an implied pressure to get it right the first time and often you only get one chance to get it right an online profile is something you can tinker with whereas theres only so much you can do to tinker with your in person profile
485092 a girl messaged me out of the blue one day claiming that i looked familiar though we had never actually met
485093 we exchanged a few messages and within a few days we were meeting up to eat chinese food and watch eternal sunshine of the spotless mind which was probably one of the things we both had in common on our profiles at the time
485094 sharing common interests is nice and it helped to know wed have things in common before we even met but having the same taste in music doesnt mean youre going to click

485113 the problem we faced within the anglican communion was that bishops gathering for lambeth represent not only their diocese but their participation in the fellowship of worldwide anglican christians where there are bishops whose participation in that worldwide fellowship is for one reason or another questionable that is the reason for questioning their participation

485119 i dont think its accurate to say my comments have nothing to do with race heres what i was saying and i think it should be undisputed i dont come out of central casting when it comes to presidential races for a whole range of reasons im young new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate in no way do i think john mccains campaign was being racist theyre cynical and i think they want to distract people from the real issues
485120 my novel is autobiographical to a degree whenever narrative necessity dictates i toss biography aside without a thought i think too much freedom is dizzying and frightening for children and adults alike were all always looking for parameters and rules for ourselves and others even if we then want to go ahead and cross them this is one of the ways we form who we are on the other hand the thrill of dizziness is not to be overlooked i actually find that now that im older and less frightened of things im much more able to appreciate and play with all the dizzying possibilities my upbringing presented

485135 es fehlt uns noch immer an speed ich hatte heute aber ein komplett anderes setup als kazuki und andere teile am auto das war aber recht kurzfristig und wir m ssen erst einmal schauen ob das die passende richtung ist ich bin heute damit gefahren auch wenn das einen gro en kompromiss bedeutet in einem kleinen bereich erreichen wir dadurch verbesserungen und der bereich scheint sehr wichtig zu sein
485136 wir bekommen also recht deutlich vor augen gef hrt wo wir uns bislang in die falsche richtung bewegt haben in den wintertests waren wir n mlich gleichauf mit den trullis jarno trulli anm d red und toyotas und red bulls wir lernen also wo wir etwas falsch gemacht haben und das best tigt sich immer mehr schon seit ein paar monaten
485137 f r uns ist das sehr positiv denn so k nnen wir gegen ende des jahres noch ein paar teile bringen das wird uns sicherlich noch helfen in der formel 1 dauert das halt immer eine ganze weile erst m ssen die elemente produziert und dann getestet werden und es braucht eine gewisse zeit bis die teile dann tats chlich auf das auto kommen
485138 im vorfeld hat man gedacht dieser kurs w rde euch vielleicht entgegenkommen haben sich deine erwartungen erf llt
485139 nein berhaupt nicht wir sind hier wirklich sehr schlecht gestartet und mussten uns wirklich ranarbeiten haben sehr viele ver nderungen vorgenommen und einen guten job dabei gemacht
485140 wir haben an diesem wochenende schon sehr viele fortschritte gemacht womit wir letztendlich recht solide dastanden im vergleich zu den vergangenen rennen in hockenheim und silverstone wo wir etwas weiter weg waren war das hier schon etwas besser aber das ist immer noch sehr weit davon entfernt wo wir hin wollen um in die top 10 hineinzugelangen h tte es heute wohl eine hammerrunde gebraucht
485141 wann rechnest du damit dass sich besserung bei euch einstellt
485142 ich wei nicht wie lange dieser prozess dauert auf der anderen seite werden wir wohl nur eine begrenzte menge an arbeitskraft in diese aufgabe stecken denn man muss nat rlich auch schon auf 2009 schauen wichtig ist aber vor allem dass wir sehen k nnen dass es die richtige richtung f r uns ist gerade im hinblick auf das kommende jahr daf r bin ich extrem zuversichtlich
485143 bist du zufrieden dass ihr wisst woran es hapert oder nervt es dich weil es nicht schnell genug geht
485144 es ist nat rlich sehr rgerlich dass wir die falsche route genommen haben sch n ist aber dass wir wenigstens verstehen woran das liegt ich gebe gewiss keine genaue auskunft aber es gab da einen bereich wo wir sehr stark falsch gegangen sind
485145 wenn du an der box aus dem auto steigst und die anderen fahren noch da wirkst du immer recht entspannt man k nnte den eindruck bekommen es sei dir beinahe egal
485146 nein aber das habe ich mir so angew hnt was soll ich mich da gro rgern das liegt ja doch nicht in meinen h nden daran kann ich wirklich gar nichts ndern ich habe in q1 mein bestes gegeben aber wenn die mich nicht rauslassen dann kann ich halt auch nichts machen ich versuche mich da nicht aufzuregen und hoffe das ist eine meiner st rken
485147 ich hatte zum einen verkehr bei meinem ersten run und habe im zweiten einen fehler gemacht das war das problem ich habe also nicht meine wirkliche performance zeigen k nnen
485148 naja wir bauen nun einmal darauf dass das kommende jahr ein gro e chance f r uns ist ich habe auch vertrauen in mein k nnen und mein technisches verst ndnis ich versuche wirklich so viele richtungen wie m glich vorzugeben
485149 das problem ist dass dieses auto so ein komplexes ding ist ich lerne noch immer neue sachen jetzt haben wir etwas wo man sich als fahrer erst einmal hineinarbeiten muss dann erst kann man verstehen was sich dahinter verbirgt und was jetzt passieren muss das ist etwas komplett neues das hat man in der gp2 einfach nicht man lernt einfach noch immer dazu
485150 hast du jemals bereut dass du deinen vertrag bei williams verl ngert hast

485188 how the power of diversity creates better groups firms schools and societies
485189 it is hardly possible to overrate the value for the improvement of human beings of things which bring them into contact with persons dissimilar to themselves and with modes of thought and action unlike those with which they are familiar there is no nation which does not need to borrow from others
485190 migration is the oldest action against poverty it selects those who most want help it is good for the country to which they go it helps break the equilibrium of poverty in the country from which they come what is the perversity in the human soul that causes people to resist so obvious a good
485191 ultimately the debate about immigration is about whether we want to live in a fairer and freer world and a more open dynamic and progressive society

485382 you two wound up starkers in the common room that was not good
485383 did you see the look on angelinas face she looked like she couldnt decide if it was christmas or halloween
485384 i mean it it might just be kreacher or it might not arthur and molly go up by the stairs ill apparate through and come in from the other side hermione if you hear any one of us cast a spell or shout something that sounds remotely bad floo the headmaster
485385 not sure how were supposed to protect the bloke who just duelled you know who though
485386 well just try to make sure you dont do anything too stupid
485387 jamie doesnt talk loudly or move quickly grandma you know that
485388 shes the one who started it you believe me dont you daddy
485389 makes everybody feel all nervous like theyre not allowed to talk
485390 okay fine it was my idea you agreed almost instantly
485391 just hold hands as much as you possibly can itll help everything i promise
485392 anything that mightve helped you in that graveyard learn as much as you can
485393 just hold hands and practice thatll help youll miss it if you dont i promise you can have years
485394 it could have been some sort of a hoax or something
485395 my jamie was dying are you willing to bet his life that it was a hoax they just wanted help somehow

485402 we confirm it and think that tnk bp has a good perspective on the russian and global market
485403 our shareholders said a year ago that if shares in tnk bp were put up for sale gazprom would consider a possible purchase
485404 both prime ministers said we need to overcome these problems and move forward
485405 stressed that across the board in pakistan all political parties want improved relations
485406 if they give me evidence then we will look into the matter
485407 recent events had made it difficult and have to be addressed
485408 this is a very important occasion not just a party
485409 we live in a hypocritical society even if people dont say they dislike you for being gay they never quite accept you
485410 it is about showing that we are here that it is time that lesbian women who walk hand in hand in the street are not gawked at or spat on as happened to a friend of mine
485411 we are here to show that being a pink family is ok
485412 the parade serves a dual purpose to celebrate that we can be who we are and that we can do it in the open and to be visible building acceptance of homosexuality
485413 we are here for the party but also for the struggle
485414 the number of incidents of discrimination and of violence against gay people has increased in the past year
485415 it is time to stop talking about tolerance and focus instead on acceptance of sexual differences in amsterdam
485416 as gay people we still get the feeling that we want to be more open but it is difficult to do so in the workplace on the sportsfield
485417 society still expects of gay people to behave normally society needs to start accepting that we add value through our differentness
485418 canarias tiene que superar la cultura de decir que no a todo
485419 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado
485420 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n
485421 las provincias son libres para crear las instancias judiciales que estimen apropiadas pero no pueden vedar a ninguna de ellas y menos a las m s altas la aplicaci n preferente de la constituci n nacional
485422 el recurso extraordinario cuya denegaci n dio origen a esta queja no se dirige contra una sentencia definitiva o equiparable a tal
485423 no tenemos ninguna confirmaci n oficial sobre la llegada de alg n ministro o si nos van a llamar para entrevistarnos con el gobernador en la capital de la provincia por lo que nosotros nos mantenemos firmes en esa ocupaci n pac fica que es una reivindicaci n territorial
485424 venimos a reivindicar nuestro derecho territorial con un acto de ocupaci n pac fica pero las medidas de acci n directa se ir n incrementando si la provincia no acusa recibo
485425 september 11 has become the catch all excuse for virtually every proposed expansion of government power
485426 one example is a national identification card and data base long desired by some in government and which was mandated by legislation passed by the congress in 2005 with the support of both senators mccain and obama although i was no longer in the congress when this bad legislation was passed i had vigorously opposed it in the years since it became law just as i led the successful effort to rescind a previous mandate for a national id card
485427 the real id act establishes a new and privacy invasive national id card program by forcing states to standardize their drivers licenses and creating a vast national data base of private information on the citizenry the law establishes through the back door something americans would never have accepted directly a national identification card
485428 there was no open and honest vote on real id the mandate was slipped into a supplemental appropriations bill discouraging any real debate over the issue
485429 creating anything close to a national id card threatens americans basic civil liberties and privacy while doing little or nothing to make us more secure
485430 means higher fees longer lines and greater inconvenience for americans getting a drivers license the burden on states which have to redesign and remake state licenses and include all manner of information on citizens applying for new drivers licenses would be extremely high and immensely costly since they would have to restructure computer databases security systems verification measures and more
485431 technically no one has to have a federally approved license
485432 that is unless you want to get on an airplane or visit a u s courthouse a veterans affairs hospital a social security office or any other federal building americans once could live their lives with minimal contact with the federal government but that is impossible today
485433 but the onus for dealing with real id falls on congress
485434 as president i would submit legislation to repeal the law i also would use my authority as president to limit the laws impact to the extent allowed by law establishing privacy safeguards extending compliance deadlines and relaxing license requirements protecting the peoples liberties and privacy is central to governments role not an afterthought factors obviously not important to my opponents in both the republican and democratic parties who supported the real id act
485435 en salta jujuy tucum n la rioja catamarca y mendoza se desarrollaron los sindicatos de obreros rurales cooperativas de trabajo y una intensa lucha por la reforma agraria se suced an asambleas y movilizaciones con hasta 5000 compa eros campesinos de sindicatos rurales y mineros apoyados por los barrios marginales se formaron dirigentes rurales mediante la educaci n popular logrando extender la organizaci n por toda la regi n
485436 el mocase nace de ra ces cristianas anarquistas ind genas y criollas recoge sentimientos la historia y memoria que queda latente en el coraz n de los campesinos la dignidad sentimiento de libertad de la necesidad de vincularse con otros y de no permitir que unos dominen a otros tambi n estuvieron presentes rastros guardados en viejos y viejas del monte el mestizaje pueblos de mucha lucha y resistencia
485437 las familias de campo sufren cada d a m s intentos de desalojos detenciones y criminalizaci n con o sin retenciones la represi n seguir las fumigaciones que nos envenenan estar n a la orden del d a y seguiremos en la lucha porque no hay ninguna intenci n de desarmar el modelo de agronegocios ni distribuci n de tierras ni cuestionamientos al actual uso de la tierra la discusi n es entre empresarios del campo y politiqueros de doble discurso
485438 se trata de un conflicto por dinero y poder ni siquiera hay una discusi n ideol gica todos ellos entienden la tierra como una mercanc a y pelean por ver qui n se queda con la mayor parte las cuatro entidades son totalmente opuestas a nuestra ideolog a con un trasfondo hist rico que a n no est saldado donde hubo usurpaci n y desaparici n de una gran parte de nuestro pueblo no nos olvidamos de ese crimen
485439 el gobierno no tiene una pol tica real para cambiar la realidad de los m s necesitados y mucho menos para los pueblos ind genas
485440 fueron masacradas en las mismas tierras que hoy son utilizadas para el monocultivo de soja
485441 el actual tipo de cambio el boom de la soja y las forestales desplazaron a la ganader a desde el litoral y la pampa hacia esta provincia las empresas donde tambi n est n las mineras intentan por todos los medios apropiarse de tierras y agua comprando fraguando t tulos usurpando y prometiendo un progreso que son mentiras
485442 reforma agraria integral y soberan a alimentaria que es la posibilidad de que el pa s tenga su propio proyecto alimentario y no que las multinacionales impongan qu se debe producir
485443 las llamadas entidades del campo s lo pronuncian los dictados de los agronegocios su s mbolo actual es la soja transg nica que ha devastado bosques desalojado comunidades contaminado suelos y aumentado los precios de los alimentos en el mercado interno el avance del modelo sojero iniciado durante el menemismo y acentuado en esta d cada significa un desierto verde y contaminado sin agricultores y ciudades saturadas de familias expulsadas de las zonas rurales
485444 el gobierno provincial alienta cuatro polos productivos la industria del az car y el tabaco el turismo y la miner a todas ellas atentan contra nuestros territorios y nuestra forma de vida
485445 repudiamos las pol ticas de exclusi n y saqueo de los territorios en que vivimos pol ticas promovidas por los grupos econ micos que tienen como c mplices a los gobiernos de turno
485446 el campo profundo reclama tierra que no se destruya m s el medio ambiente agua y reclama pol ticas para frenar el xodo hacia las ciudades y todo esto no depende de las retenciones depende de pol ticas reales que ning n gobierno impulsa
485447 la faa no dice que sus afiliados con la complicidad del sistema pol tico y jur dico desalojan campesinos y sinceremos que esos productores no cosechan alimentos en beneficio del pueblo producen forrajes para la especulaci n en el mercado externo
485448 esas cuatro patronales no nos representan pero tampoco el gobierno que nos ha fallado nos abandon

485462 if you had asked me about my chances before the judge ruled id have had a neutral response
485463 my family and i didnt know where to turn who to contact
485464 we were sitting there talking and the next thing you know i reached up and choked jennifer
485465 i did this on my own without any prior discussion with dustin turner he did not encourage me in any way and in fact i remember one instance while i was choking jennifer dustin trying to pull my hands away
485466 were always concerned about what the other side has to say against us
485467 but if you present credible testimony of the actual murderer its hard to say someone would have found turner guilty
485468 my most anger has been toward billy brown he murdered an innocent young lady and sent me to prison and upset countless lives but im not so angry anymore i do still harbor some feeling toward the prosecutors but its not a hatred

485581 liberty has never come from the government liberty has always come from the subjects of it the history of liberty is a history of resistance the history of liberty is a history of limitations of governmental power not the increase of it
485582 i have never been able to conceive how any rational being could propose happiness to himself from the exercise of power over others
485583 power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely great men are always bad men
485584 it is said that power corrupts but actually its more true that power attracts the corruptable the sane are usually attracted by other things than power
485585 the attempt to combine wisdom and power has only rarely been successful and then only for a short while
485586 i hope our wisdom will grow with our power and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be
485587 i consider the foundation of the constitution as laid on this ground that all powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states or to the people 10th amendment to take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specifically drawn around the powers of congress is to take possession of a boundless field of power no longer susceptible to any definition
485588 every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone the people themselves are its only safe depositories
485589 the congress whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary shall propose amendments to this constitution or on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states shall call a convention for proposing amendments which in either case shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of this constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states or by conventions in three fourths thereof
485590 if in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution designates but let there be no change by usurpation for though this in one instance may be the instrument of good it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed
485591 we are a non partisan association of american citizens from every state in our republic comprised of a broad range of occupations ethnicities religious affiliations and political persuasions our common bond is a deep commitment to preserving the values and principles embodied in our founding documents the declaration of independence and the constitution upon which this nation was founded
485592 i have openly confronted several congress members in public arenas now directly this campaign season is open season on them they all respond with thundering silence completely dumbfounded one chased me down after the showbiz to ask about it they dont have a clue what the constitution says its not just that they wont address the issue neither the members nor their staff have a clue
485593 however political parties may now and then answer popular ends they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion
485594 one of the saddest lessons of history is this if weve been bamboozled long enough we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle the bamboozle has captured us once you give a charlatan power over you you almost never get it back

485598 no se puede gobernar en tiempos de crisis con personas que no tienen experiencia por lo tanto el que tiene que tomar decisiones es l y ella no puede gobernar sin l no tiene ninguna posibilidad

485610 that can be good because you can get a deeper sense of a person on a social networking profile than you can on a dating profile
485611 social networking sites are usually used fairly frequently by their users so you get a truer picture of who the people on the site are but there is a negative side too
485612 people tend to play the profile they learn everything they can about a person and then bring it up on their date in order to be more likable that can lead to a distorted reality of who the person behind the profile really is
485613 he was well read well educated everything in his profile was spelled correctly
485614 he had an eclectic taste in music and movies and didnt take himself too seriously
485615 once i arrived he had to sneak me through the back stairs of his flat and up to his bedroom because he lived with his parents and they were asleep
485616 i was completely mortified but figured we had good chatting chemistry so i could at least give him the benefit of the doubt
485617 once he set up the movie he didnt say a word to me and i was so bored i had to leave because i was falling asleep
485618 for some people inept at communicating in person online meet and greets are much easier
485619 they can be themselves they have time to think about how to respond to someone approaching them
485620 but in person theres an implied pressure to get it right the first time and often you only get one chance to get it right an online profile is something you can tinker with whereas theres only so much you can do to tinker with your in person profile
485621 a girl messaged me out of the blue one day claiming that i looked familiar though we had never actually met
485622 we exchanged a few messages and within a few days we were meeting up to eat chinese food and watch eternal sunshine of the spotless mind which was probably one of the things we both had in common on our profiles at the time
485623 sharing common interests is nice and it helped to know wed have things in common before we even met but having the same taste in music doesnt mean youre going to click

485666 se nos ha hecho distintas promesas pero hasta ahora solo se nos ha concedido colocar una cruz dentro del edificio museo y no cobrarle la entrada a los grupos que previamente avisan de su llegada me parece francamente un poco irrespetuosa esta actitud dado lo expresado por distintas autoridades locales y nacionales

485745 national has confirmed they would borrow to cover the massive hole they will create in the public accounts if elected unless they are prepared to slash public services once again
485746 the national partys proposed economic programme for new zealand can be summed up in four words more borrowing from foreigners

485803 we did find some areas where although he initially resisted he came around
485804 it was a classic strategy of giving the president things he doesnt want in bills he has to have
485805 in the eighth year of the presidency and in this environment bushs veto was pretty strong
485806 he had to compromise and he had to do it in two ways either they negotiated out a compromise or he was pushed into a compromise politically because of where the votes were
485807 the president doesnt get involved much with what goes on around here
485808 talking about a second stimulus package right now is premature

485905 we live in a hypocritical society even if people dont say they dislike you for being gay they never quite accept you

485907 we are here to show that being a pink family is ok
485908 the parade serves a dual purpose to celebrate that we can be who we are and that we can do it in the open and to be visible building acceptance of homosexuality
485909 we are here for the party but also for the struggle
485910 the number of incidents of discrimination and of violence against gay people has increased in the past year
485911 it is time to stop talking about tolerance and focus instead on acceptance of sexual differences in amsterdam
485912 as gay people we still get the feeling that we want to be more open but it is difficult to do so in the workplace on the sportsfield
485913 society still expects of gay people to behave normally society needs to start accepting that we add value through our differentness
485914 history makes it clear however that the legend of fanatical muslims sweeping through the world and forcing islam a the point of a sword upon conquered races is one of the most fantastically absurd myths that historians have ever repeated
485915 the more important factor for the spread of islam is its just religious law shariah which was designed to cover all manefestations of life

485932 im just hanging back a little bit and watching what is going on
485933 i feel very privileged to be here its a great honour to be amongst all these athletes
485934 cricketers and other professional sportsmen probably dont realise how lucky theyve got it compared with some of these other sports like water polo gymnastics and rowing
485935 theyre not really making any money at all and it gives me a new perspective on being a cricketer
485936 ive always loved the olympic games for me it is the ultimate sporting event
485937 i wont be wearing too many singlets around the rowers thats for sure
485938 i think i can use the experience of my professional career in things like dealing with the media being away from home and so on
485939 people have the same issues across most sports they have the same dedication the same desires the same pride the only difference is the money
485940 its a bit tattered to take away and i didnt want to risk losing it so its stayed at home for this one
485941 i love rugby league and like nothing more than sitting down on a friday night to watch the match of the round but lately i get the feeling that they are in danger of believing their own publicity a bit too much
485942 despite claims to the contrary the broader promotion of the game and wider geographic placement of franchises within the two competitions has done nothing to grow the palyer base or take the game beyond its tradtional
485943 i feel that he is a very honest person as opposed to some slick operator he speaks in a low voice and very cautiously

485945 heavens im am really incensed why dont you make up some even more shameless lies
485946 what a far stretched piece anyone with commonsense would know that if she had the kind of character that you described she would not have resorted to suicide netizens are not as stupid as you imagine
485947 it was february by then and netizen interest had weakened significantly even if the lawsuit ends in a victory it wouldnt do much good
485948 the chinese internet is not based upon real name registration of users even if there is an id can the person be found do we have to rely on the police that is too much trouble
485949 there are two problems here first can we prove that jiang hong made that post we are required to provide the evidence secondly wang fei does not want to continue to tangle with jiangs family the feeling was that it is unacceptable to sue jiang yans sister
485950 1 the deletions were made by the editor on duty and the administrator has no right to interfere with those operations 2 the editor on duty makes deletion for a reason please understand and support us personally i feel that it is disrespectful to disclose private details about individuals especially when the principal is deceased please understand
485951 it was a lot of trouble to file the case i went there many times some judges did not think that there was an invasion of privacy because there is a lot of similar information on the internet some even asked whether we knew who made the posts some of the judges said that our evidence was incomplete some of the posts were in english and i had to find a translation company to translate them into chinese after a few rounds the last judge was a younger person perhaps he was more familiar with the internet he accepted the case without another word
485952 if this incident had occurred off the internet i could win this case for sure
485953 previously i was not aware of this incident i seldom go to forums such as tianya when i saw the information that wang fei provided to me my first reaction was that this was really going too far
485954 for example the internet says that jiang yan paid for the living expenses of wang fei for five years wang fei has the savings passbook and remittance notices from his father as evidence that his parents paid for his living expenses in addition netizens said that before jiang yan was even buried wang fei went with the third party to shanghai for leisure a photo was even posted on the internet wang fei showed me the photo and asked do you think that this looks like me it isnt me i looked carefully and it was not him
485955 the internet version of the story is wang fei admits that his entire family has met dong fang and she is even staying at his parents place the parents call her the lovely little angel this is libel because the parents of wang fei said that dong fang has gone to eat at their place only once wang fei is fighting with the family of the deceased over the estate is also libel calling wang fei a despicable man constitutes an insult there is even more that goes farther than this
485956 these items merely showed that the wang family sent money to wang fei between september 2002 and 2004 this only establishes that wang received financial aid from his own family while he studied it does not establish what the total expenses had been nor what that money was really used for the possibility cannot be excluded that wang fei was receiving financial aid from jiang yan besides in the blog post dated november 24 2007 jiang yan recorded the fact that she had been responsible for the living expenses of the couple for a long time
485957 during the entire hearing process our suggestions were repeatedly confirmed by the evidence provided by the other side we offered the telephone records of jiang yan and they offered those of the father of wang fei the records match each other completely and they are perfectly consistent with what jiang hong wrote about the matter
485958 why did the principal say in front of the national media especially in response to the question from cctv twice that no such relationship exists did you lie to all of society or did wang fei lie to his lawyer and the law
485959 the plaintiff had no reply we are very glad to see that there are doubts about the details of the case
485960 i believe that the typical case of internet violence is to run a human flesh search on a person who has done no wrong and then publish that information for example the little girl who said very yellow very violent was searched just for uttering that one phrase but when an adult did something wrong and caused grave harm to his wife and her family why shouldnt society know about this the internet is a place where public opinion is collected together the netizens are not loiterers who roam the internet and look to condemn people without verifying the information let me say that the information that had not been verified is now turning out to be verified facts which wang fei even admits to so why cant people offer a negative opinion about him
485961 some people think that gunfights movie cause robberies so does not mean that anyone who makes a gunfight movie should be locked up for the same reason i think the protection of privacy cannot be regulated by saying that certain information are private and cannot be made public there ought to be legislation that regulates how people use information that was obtained through searching
485962 a good wife was driven to die a blood debt shall be repaid with blood
485963 the so called evidence from wang feis lawyer was ripped to shreds and it seems that we have the upper hand at this time
485964 wangs lawyer offered the phone records of his brother and said that wang had used that phone to speak zhang believes that this showed that wang did not carry out his duties and left everything to his brother
485965 frontline reporter news wang thinks that seeking justice for jiang yan means attacking him he said that dong fang has only been to the wang home only once that they are not co habiting that they traveled overseas due to company arrangements that the savings in the bank belonged to him that wangs father did not call jiang yan and only sent one sms that wang fei actively took care of the funeral arrangements
485966 the livecasts by the netizens are biased how could i end up being at a loss for words we are the victims and we have a lot to say
485967 attention please continue the livecasts i want to see how the law can carry out the public will i want to see how heartless cads such as wang fei be spat upon
485968 our netizen friend xiu jia was interviewed by a female cctv reporter before the session began and said it was not very appropriate to post the information on wang fei but we dont have a better way of expressing our anger based upon what the female reporter is saying her emphasis seems to be on internet violence xiu jia is concerned that cctv has got her into saying something that will be used against her
485969 it is somewhat controversial among the academics just what is private information after the internet came along i personally view private information as that which one is unwilling to let others know about right now people treat their mobile phone numbers as private information but i dont agree with that i believe that there is an issue of freedom of speech here another issue is that we should know that the disclosure of the information would not cause mental harm to the person damage often occur as a result of misuse of information this type of misuse violates other rights but not that of privacy
485970 although there are no laws in china that define what the right to privacy is it is possible to discern the legal rules from the textbooks is your mobile telephone number private information if you voluntarily provide it then it is no longer private information but if someone else posted it on the internet without your permission is that an invasion of privacy
485971 based upon what i know the judges are also stuck on this issue now and they are worried if we just look at one aspect then it is easy to say the defendants violated wang feis right to privacy i dont think that there is any problem but there is another value how can we defend the netizens freedom of speech i think that the difficulty lies in the balance between these two sets of interests and the clash between these two values
485972 if you were the judge how would you try to balance the relationship between the two
485973 frankly speaking i have my ideas but i am afraid to reveal them publicly first of all even if i say it people wont listen to me secondly i am very careful when it comes to the internet and i respect them in this case i am looking forward to see how the joint court will ultimately write in the verdict document actually there are no grand issues involved in this case and there are no issues about which laws are applicable the key is how the judges will decide if their interpretation is good this will become a very significant legal precedent it depends on the wisdom of the judges
485974 the name address date of birth identification card number medical records employment records photos and other independent information that can be used to identify specific persons should be listed as personal information
485975 every day we get requests to delete posts like these especially now more and more people want to delete the personal information that they left behind unwittingly several years ago because they are concerned that they may be exposed by the human flesh search engines personally speaking i am willing to delete such posts provided that they are not high in public attention in the end i do not think that the value of the human flesh search is about ordinary people and events there is no need to allow this sort of thing to happen so frequently in real life especially if the information is being used for illegal purposes
485976 the jiang yan affair has become a public affair and therefore requires a different approach to deal with it the jiang yan affair reflects a big debate about moral views in society it involves the elements of a crime and it has social values tianya is not a news outlet it is a huge platform for netizens to communicate freely with each other and express their own views it contains all sorts of viewpoints and angles it is diversified and it is free
485977 any posts pertaining to private information will be deleted it may not be deleted immediately because it make take some time before our workers read them but all posts will be seen at least once when an important human flesh search becomes a public affair we may even use certain key information about the principals as keywords to be filtered out the netizens wont be able to post on them
485978 people have a far too narrow understanding of human flesh search and they seem to connect it with internet violence actually how many of the human flesh searches every day has to do with looking for personal information for example at mop people are more often seeking help to find useful information
485979 i dont know if the wang fei case will cause the authorities to come up with a systematic set of administrative rules
485980 i am pessimistic on that i do not feel that there will be any new regulations
485981 queremos o reconhecimento por esse trabalho da dona de casa da dom stica da artes da extrativista e que a previd ncia seja universal e todos tenham direito
485982 a nossa luta para que o governo brasileiro que diz que o pa s est em um momento excelente crescendo com as riquezas se consolidando tome consci ncia e organize um sistema de previd ncia que cubra todas as pessoas
485983 o principal problema que a previd ncia foi um sistema pensado como se apenas os homens trabalhassem ele tem uma concep o contributiva ou seja pagar para poder receber o benef cio
485984 n s mulheres historicamente fazemos trabalhos sem remunera o aquele para a pr pria fam lia dom stico cuidar da crian a de quem est doente e muitas vezes somos dependentes economicamente e n o temos como pagar a previd ncia
485985 n o contribu mos mas trabalhamos muitas vezes desde muito cedo em alguns casos as meninas come am a trabalhar em casa cuidando dos irm os menores para que a m e possa trabalhar fora
485986 apenas um sistema previdenci rio universal em que todo mundo que trabalhe possa ter direito ao benef cio atenderia s mulheres
485987 aquela que trabalha em casa sem remunera o tem que ter o direito de receber o aux lio doen a caso se acidente e fique sem condi es de realizar suas atividades
485988 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while

485993 please return to polar bear mode youre being judgy and should avoid other humans
485994 you seem to have the wherewithal to show love today it is a good day to interact more like a lion

485998 we dont really know if this was planted by some trojan virus introduced in the intarweb tubes by an alien race
485999 on the one hand weve got this growing community with individuals who have higher than average incomes a flourishing economy and some tremendous assets that really contribute to peoples quality of life but there are some significant challenges associated with that growth a greater number of individuals are at risk of slipping into poverty and will if they dont get support from services they need
486000 when youve got a population thats growing at a rate that it is growing there are tremendous stresses and strains on all systems
486001 there is an increasing demand on social services because of the growth that is taking place and because of the complexity of the issues people are facing
486002 the difficulty is that in every area that the ministry of community and social services and the ministry of children and youth provide us with funding were significantly underfunded
486003 what that means is were constantly unable to respond to the demands for service
486004 investing in the social well being of these high growth communities will have a positive impact on economic prosperity
486005 when people cannot access the services they need the potential for crisis rises continually whether it is a battered woman seeking support a child needing mental health counselling or a senior needing care or a hip replacement the longer they wait the more likely it is that more costly interventions will be required to address the unmet needs in the gta 905 and to prevent the risk of more costly interventions we the strong communities coalition urge the ontario government to make immediate investment in human and social services in the gta 905
486006 we are always pleased the funding is forthcoming but when we look at our allocation and see that weve lost ground it becomes problematic
486007 the funding formulas have to address historical inequities have to cover the actual cost of delivering the program and have to incorporate growth related factors
486008 because if we continue for instance to get 10 per cent of whats available but our population is growing at a rate that is higher than in other areas we continue to fall behind
486009 our shift if you will grows over time if they cap what they consider allowable
486010 we understand that this requires a lot of resources and we dont have any misconceptions that this can be resolved overnight
486011 this is about improving access to services so that residents of brampton mississauga and caledon and other high growth communities have the same access to services as other residents of ontario that just seems like the morally responsible thing to do
486012 well lick our wounds we get a break now for a week or so and then re group and really look forward to our preparation for south africa where we play two important matches
486013 the effort the guys put out there tonight was massive but unfortunately it didnt go our way and the harder we tried the more we seemed to dig ourselves into a hole
486014 i thought they the wallabies played well last week we played well this week
486015 i love rugby league and like nothing more than sitting down on a friday night to watch the match of the round but lately i get the feeling that they are in danger of believing their own publicity a bit too much
486016 despite claims to the contrary the broader promotion of the game and wider geographic placement of franchises within the two competitions has done nothing to grow the palyer base or take the game beyond its tradtional
486017 it wont be the last time we lose and well win another game at some point as well
486018 the all blacks built pressure and didnt allow us to build any pressure
486019 they were very effective on the tackle line on the gain line very effective around the breakdown and as a consequence we werent able to get into the game
486020 they profited from some of that pressure that they built and its one of those days where you try and create momentum sometimes you look outside the square to do that and you just have a sense that nothings going to work
486021 its not one well look back on and reflect on with a lot of pride and that also probably reflected the way the game went
486022 i love rugby league and like nothing more than sitting down on a friday night to watch the match of the round but lately i get the feeling that they are in danger of believing their own publicity a bit too much
486023 despite claims to the contrary the broader promotion of the game and wider geographic placement of franchises within the two competitions has done nothing to grow the palyer base or take the game beyond its tradtional
486024 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
486025 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
486026 i love rugby league and like nothing more than sitting down on a friday night to watch the match of the round but lately i get the feeling that they are in danger of believing their own publicity a bit too much
486027 despite claims to the contrary the broader promotion of the game and wider geographic placement of franchises within the two competitions has done nothing to grow the palyer base or take the game beyond its tradtional
486028 ik heb steeds de afstellingen gewijzigd maar was nooit n met het parcours
486029 ik heb alles gegeven wat ik kan maar hoe harder ik aanviel hoe minder ik er werd voor beloond in chronoritten met weinig lange bochten kon ik nog goede tijden draaien maar ik was niet regelmatig genoeg om voor rossetti te blijven
486030 over the next five games if we only won two of those i dont think the confidence is going to drop away either
486031 obviously they will try to shut the run down and it will a tight in close game
486032 a bit of a drudge and a bit of a chore sometimes for players
486033 but once you can see september once you hit august i think the enthusiasm starts to pick up again
486034 every team goes through a bit of a trough at some stage and we have the last two weeks but weve got no doubt well bounce back
486035 i love rugby league and like nothing more than sitting down on a friday night to watch the match of the round but lately i get the feeling that they are in danger of believing their own publicity a bit too much
486036 despite claims to the contrary the broader promotion of the game and wider geographic placement of franchises within the two competitions has done nothing to grow the palyer base or take the game beyond its tradtional
486037 i would rather lionel messi be there because potentially when we beat them they will have no excuses
486038 the hardest thing to coach in football is making chances
486039 if youre making them and not scoring the goals will eventually come
486040 if youre not making the chances then we have a few problems
486041 hopefully i can do a lot more talking with my feet than i do maybe with my mouth
486042 im just hoping i can bring a lot of experience and settle the boys down when it gets too much
486043 we are striving for nine points we are here to be confident and every game is a game we want win
486044 i love rugby league and like nothing more than sitting down on a friday night to watch the match of the round but lately i get the feeling that they are in danger of believing their own publicity a bit too much
486045 despite claims to the contrary the broader promotion of the game and wider geographic placement of franchises within the two competitions has done nothing to grow the palyer base or take the game beyond its tradtional
486046 the try was just through effort we play for the full 80 minutes and we make it pretty hard for everyone
486047 the first field goal was pretty ugly the second one was nice
486048 its funny i practiced a few yesterday so i must have had a feeling it was going to be a close game
486049 theyre tough to lose those ones im sure nathan and the boys will be very disappointed
486050 weve had our fair share of experiences in those situations and i really credit my blokes today for their determination and courage
486051 at 12 0 we didnt panic and the result was a very handy result for us
486052 there was some young players that came up with some errors that were crucial and hopefully they learn from them
486053 its sad that you put so much effort in and you dont actually take anything away from it
486054 i love rugby league and like nothing more than sitting down on a friday night to watch the match of the round but lately i get the feeling that they are in danger of believing their own publicity a bit too much
486055 despite claims to the contrary the broader promotion of the game and wider geographic placement of franchises within the two competitions has done nothing to grow the palyer base or take the game beyond its tradtional
486056 ultimately this will be important for our common efforts in addressing climate change issues
486057 have uncovered evidence that british muslims are actively supporting the taliban and al qaida in attacks on coalition forces in southern afghanistan
486058 there are british passport holders who live in britain who are being found in places like kandahar
486059 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk
486060 this is a highly significant mission if we do not win against the protagonists of the 9 11 attacks then those who are against us will take great succour from it
486061 its a bonus for anyone like me who didnt know what to do with coins and didnt throw them away
486062 to let over 430 seats in iits go vacant is a criminal waste of infrastructure such as faculty and physical facilities
486063 there is no time this year but we may try to seek permission to transfer the vacant seats to the general category for next year
486064 every iit seat has the potential to produce a nandan nilekani or a vinod khosla
486065 to allow even one seat to go vacant is like crushing a million dreams and aspirations
486066 unthinking way in which the hrd ministry merrily commissioned half a dozen new institutes and expanded quota seats without so much as a thought as to whether or not reserved candidates would qualify
486067 he kept his bulky hand on my shoulder and asked me professor yeh kya kar diya
486068 i spent a long time understanding the chinese people and helped open the olympic door for china
486069 over the past seven years china has made great efforts to honour its commitment and showcased its capability to the world
486070 as beijing olympic organising committee has demonstrated great wisdom i am convinced that it will remove all the obstacles and stage an amazing olympics
486071 i love rugby league and like nothing more than sitting down on a friday night to watch the match of the round but lately i get the feeling that they are in danger of believing their own publicity a bit too much
486072 despite claims to the contrary the broader promotion of the game and wider geographic placement of franchises within the two competitions has done nothing to grow the palyer base or take the game beyond its tradtional
486073 earlier in the year the talk around the football world was were not going to see bags any more because of the ability of players to flood back
486074 but what youre seeing in the modern game is most teams are now really trying to move the ball on quickly to beat those numbers pushing back into space and what its allowing is one on one isolation for some of our great forwards whether it be franklin or fevola or lloyd or brisbanes jonathan brown
486075 those guys are really difficult match ups one on one because theyve got leap and strength and smarts
486076 ive helped the team up the ground and endurance wise im not too bad ive probably never been able to use it
486077 my turnaround in form has coincided with the teams and when the teams going well it helps you as a forward
486078 to see a bloke whos played 14 years of footy fly so high it shows theres a little bit of ping left in his legs
486079 we got ourselves back in that situation which was good but thats when youve really got to tighten the screws even further and work even harder to ensure you can get a lead
486080 we almost got there and then we fell behind and had to play catch up for most of the day
486081 i love rugby league and like nothing more than sitting down on a friday night to watch the match of the round but lately i get the feeling that they are in danger of believing their own publicity a bit too much

486083 the athletes can criticise china freely in their country in public places in china in the mixed zones where you reporters meet them
486084 we ask them simply to not take part in propaganda or any political religious commercial or racial demonstration
486085 if we allow propaganda in the olympic village or in the stadiums it is the end of the olympic harmony
486086 i love rugby league and like nothing more than sitting down on a friday night to watch the match of the round but lately i get the feeling that they are in danger of believing their own publicity a bit too much

486088 something similar happened in turkey we just sat there and lost time before we could get the engine going and start driving
486089 i couldnt have done any more its been flat out since the first stage
486090 its been a very very tough day and at the end of it my lead has increased by less than four seconds
486091 but it has been a good battle with mikko and i have found it hard to keep him behind but at the moment he will be behind tomorrow and i hope to keep him there until the finish
486092 you look different too you look just a tiny bit more slappable than you used to

486108 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
486109 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
486110 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
486111 if you had asked me about my chances before the judge ruled id have had a neutral response
486112 my family and i didnt know where to turn who to contact
486113 we were sitting there talking and the next thing you know i reached up and choked jennifer
486114 i did this on my own without any prior discussion with dustin turner he did not encourage me in any way and in fact i remember one instance while i was choking jennifer dustin trying to pull my hands away
486115 were always concerned about what the other side has to say against us
486116 but if you present credible testimony of the actual murderer its hard to say someone would have found turner guilty
486117 my most anger has been toward billy brown he murdered an innocent young lady and sent me to prison and upset countless lives but im not so angry anymore i do still harbor some feeling toward the prosecutors but its not a hatred

486133 but theyre too afraid to talk to you so they come to me
486134 fear is no excuse people who live in fear are people who vote for wars we dont need
486135 just keep it clean they are too afraid to talk to you
486136 how funny because i talked to them last night and it didnt seem to be too big of a deal i think that youre making too big of a deal out of this and i dont appreciate being pestered by calls after 11pm

486187 last month the fcc focused attention on the thorny problem of early termination fees as commission chairman kevin martin said he favored a nationwide resolution of termination fees he also suggested that termination fees more accurately track the actual cost of phones given to consumers a 50 phone would call for a lower termination fee than a 250 phone for instance

486446 we have been matched 4 years ago and found out immediately that we both had a positive vision of the world we live in because of it we get along very well even in difficult circumstances so the life perspective we have inside its a great anchor

486550 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
486551 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
486552 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
486553 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
486554 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
486555 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
486556 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
486557 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
486558 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable

486575 many developers lament why the need for another language and why not improve swing the gui toolkit library well ria markets are now evolved to appeal to designers and not only to developers through creating a declarative language that much easier to learn and use while still allow flexibility and power through the core programmatic language for example flex used mxml based on xml as a foundation to build ui with strong data binding capability and actionscript for programming similarly javafx uses javafx script to create ui and java to extend the application further why switch to javafx when competitors are already have version of products ahead of javafx among the major reasons are existing java developers can leverage on myriad existing java open source libraries existing investment and develop javafx application using state of art and powerful ide like netbeans eclipse and intellij beside another outstanding component of javafx technology aka javafx mobile will give a boost in creating rich and powerful mobile application by having almost a full blown java sdk built into the phone compare to the limited environment of j2me the greatest advantage is that the same desktop application built with javafx can be used in the javafx based mobile phone without changing the code base
486576 each platform has a core strength our strength comes from the ubiquity of the java runtime in the mobile area where we are pervasive and in the six million java developers who can extend their capabilities to provide web resident apps and can do it in a faster time frame
486577 we initially thought flash flex would be easier to start with but in the end it was harder to do certain functions javafx gives us the advantage of tying into those tried and true java apis that are vital to our app so while the tools are lacking they are going to be there

486635 a national emergency exists by reason of the terrorist attacks at the world trade center new york new york and the pentagon and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the united states now therefore i george w bush president of the united states of america by virtue of the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states i hereby declare that the national emergency has existed since september 11 2001
486636 consistent with section 202 d of the national emergencies act 50 u
486637 because the actions of these persons who commit threaten to commit or support terrorism continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the united states the national emergency declared on september 23 2001 and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond september 23 2007 therefore in accordance with section 202 d of the national emergencies act 50 u s c 1622 d i am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to persons who commit threaten to commit or support terrorism
486638 simply by proclaiming a national emergency on friday president bush activated some 500 dormant legal provisions including those allowing him to impose censorship and martial law
486639 these proclamations give force to 470 provisions of federal law taken together they confer enough authority to rule the country without reference to normal constitutional processes under the powers delegated by these statutes the president may seize property organize and control the means of production seize commodities assign military forces abroad institute martial law seize and control all transportation and communications regulate the operation of private enterprise restrict travel and in a plethora of particular ways control the lives of all american citizens

486644 we have not been informed at all about the role of the shadow government or its whereabouts or what particular responsibilities they have and when they would kick in but we look forward to work with the administration to get additional information on that

486646 fresh intelligence assessment of terrorist threats to the continuity of our government
486647 vice president dick cheney has been resisting even his own executive branchs efforts to find out what kind of secret material his office has been stashing away over the last four years cheneys office according to a story first reported by the chicago tribune has resisted attempts by a tiny federal agency to compile information in accordance with an executive order signed by george bush himself on the classified documents being held by the vice presidents operation cheneys office argued that the vice presidents office because it has both executive and legislative branch duties is exempt from the order
486648 beyond cases of actual insurrection the president may now use military troops as a domestic police force in response to a natural disaster a disease outbreak terrorist attack or to any other condition changes of this magnitude should be made only after a thorough public airing but these new presidential powers were slipped into the law without hearings or public debate
486649 i see nothing in the cog document entitled presidential directive nspd51 to prevent even a
486650 because of the attacks of sept 11 2001 the american public needs no explanation of continuity of government plans
486651 maybe the people who think theres a conspiracy out there are right
486652 if members of the homeland security committee cannot enforce their right to read secret plans of the executive branch then the systems of checks and balances established by the u s constitution would seem to be failing to put it another way if the white house is successful in frustrating defazio then continuity of government planning has arguably already superseded the constitution as a higher authority
486653 will congress insist on its right of review cog the answer to this question will depend on discussion in the blogosphere the degree of pressure exerted by the electorate on their representatives and the questions asked the men and women who would be president

486659 cos sembrava delle donne tra il pubblico strillarono calvin spier che aveva osservato questo evento inatteso con unespressione vacua e sorpresa sulla faccia si sporse con aria da conversazione sopra la tavola come per spiegare al pubblico a bocca aperta cosera successo e vomit sulla testa di marguerite charbonneau moglie del sindaco lei url e indietreggi portandosi inutilmente le mani ai capelli ormai ricoperti di una miscela di bacche masticate fagioli stufati e wurstel parzialmente digeriti si volse verso la sua buona amica maria lavine e vomit sul davanti della giacca di daino di maria in rapida successione come una serie di mortaretti bill travis lanci un grande e apparentemente sovraccarico getto di vomito sulle prime due file di spettatori con la faccia sbalordita di chi proclamava a ciascuno e a tutti gente non posso crederci che sono io a fare questo chuck day che aveva ricevuto una generosa porzione del dono a sorpresa di bill travis vomit sulle sue hush puppies e poi le fiss con aria interrogativa ma sapendo benissimo che quella roba non sarebbe mai andata via dalla pelle scamosciata john wiggins direttore delle elementari di grenta apr la bocca macchiata di blu e disse con tono di disapprovazione
486660 i dont think so i think its about getting in touch with reality about balancing aspirations and actuality
486661 since the second world war and the beginning of the atomic age the consciousness of the creative writer however detached has been confronted with the specter of the totalitarian state the growing poverty and helplessness of western europe and the threat of an inconceivably destructive war which may annihilate civilization and mankind itself clearly when the future of civilization is no longer assured a criticism if american life in terms of a contrast between avowed ideals and present actuality cannot be a primary preoccupation and source of inspiration for america not europe is now the sanctuary of culture civilizations very existence depends upon america upon the actuality of american life and not the ideals of the american dream to criticize the actuality upon which all hope depends thus becomes a criticism of hope itself
486662 ive got nothing to do and im doing it tomorrow
486663 obviously if you are reading this then i have died in iraq i kind of predicted this that is why im writing this in november a third time just seemed like im pushing my chances i dont regret going everybody dies but few get to do it for something as important as freedom it may seem confusing why we are in iraq its not to me im here helping these people so that they can live the way we live not have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators to do what they want with their lives to me that is why i died others have died for my freedom now this is my mark
486664 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
486665 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
486666 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
486667 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
486668 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
486669 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
486670 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
486671 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
486672 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
486673 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
486674 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
486675 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
486676 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
486677 i dont think so i think its about getting in touch with reality about balancing aspirations and actuality
486678 the urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule it

486727 all these fires could be the childs curse his way of getting revenge
486728 any connection with the fires is purely coincidental fires are not started by pictures or coincidence but by careless acts and omissions

486736 an old spanish portrait artist named franchot seville who lives in madrid
486737 the priest told the artist to have nothing to do with the runaway because wherever he settled fires of unknown origin would mysteriously break out the villagers called him diablo because of this

486795 the interesting question is where to place it for that family audience
486796 it does moderately well for the sci fi channel but it transmits for a 9 p m slot which it isnt written or made for
486797 you know what were pleased with the way its been performing for us
486798 youre not special youre not powerful youre not connected youre not clever youre not important
486799 we wanted to break the format and do something different particularly after how powerful the climax was with the death of two major characters
486800 so were telling one big story in season 3 and putting the torchwood crew under a huge amount of pressure and just seeing how they cope with their numbers depleted
486801 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
486802 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
486803 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right
486804 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much
486805 but there is a tiny part of me that kind of prefers she does stay dead
486806 its a big show for bbc america and its a show they are really proud of and it works really well i dont exactly know what that means in physical numbers but it gets a lot of airtime and it gets a lot of coverage
486807 fancying people and not knowing what to do about it
486808 tosh is learning about herself coming out of her shell shes a late bloomer
486809 we were losing a team member and a part of our torchwood family
486810 you dont know a hell of a lot about him
486811 when we first met him he was not a very likable person
486812 im going to be an action hero i might get my own figure i love science fiction
486813 i thought they had far too much time on their hands
486814 therell be a ticking clock a big event and it will push the torchwood team into new territory

486823 he knows what those are and we will move forward
486824 ken got overwhelmed with every single player coming up to him and telling him hello
486825 i think it was great that he came out today a lesser person would not have come out but he did and we cant wait to get him back
486826 i know hes extremely remorseful and he understands but if we want to be a good football team we have to win without him
486827 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
486828 and if we can come up with a genuine bi partisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence then that is something i am open to

486830 time has completed its cycle and is as it was on the day when allaah created the heavens and the earth the year is twelve months of which four are sacred three consecutive months and muharram and the rajab of mudar which comes between jumaada and shabaan
486831 the postponing of a sacred month is indeed an addition to disbelief thereby the disbelievers are led astray for they make it lawful one year and forbid it another year in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by allaah and make such forbidden ones lawful
486832 how many times did the messenger of allaah sallallaahu alaihi wasallam do umrah

486834 he is saying that the messenger of allaah sallallaahu alaihi wasallam did umrah four times one of them in rajab
486835 may allaah have mercy on abu abd al rahmaan the prophet sallallaahu alaihi wasallam never did umrah but he witnessed it i e he was present with him and he never did umrah during rajab

486855 that will all play out i think tyreke evans a rivals com five star freshman guard will be one of them it could be robert dozier should be one of the top 10 players in the country antonio anderson one of two returning starters with dozier is a glue guy his assist to turnover ratio after the beginning of the year was ridiculous roburt sallie were trying to figure him out we think he could be really good
486856 what i enjoyed hearing was those general managers saying he could be a lottery pick if he works hard this summer hes long active hes got to get stronger and improve his skills
486857 its better to hear that for me than anything else it wasnt an agent or a family member it was the guy who was going to pick you telling you this he said it doesnt look like im going to get drafted and i said then you better come back here if what those gms told you doesnt inspire you theres nothing that will ever inspire you because those are the guys who pick the players
486858 i did my research talking with nebraska coach doc sadler whos a good friend of mine to make sure hes what i thought he was
486859 robert and antonio said hes a great guy and will be a great teammate hes what youre looking for that was the ringing endorsement that i needed to hear
486860 last year we had a team that was friends first and teammates second can we get back to that thats what were trying to do
486861 tyreke wont play the same position as derrick hell be more like chris douglas roberts
486862 were telling him to be him dont try to be anybody else its the natural position for him to score the ball and create double teams so he can make easy passes out to teammates wesley witherspoon people watching them this summer people all are saying he has a chance to be unbelievable he could play the 1 2 3 or 4 we could play him at the 4 and have a point forward there hes 6 8 and can play above the rim he just has to improve his shooting he needs to get stronger and improve his shot tyreke physically is ahead of wesley but wesley will be tremendous for us
486863 im excited about justin timberlake and how he used the espys in a way to really help us
486864 whether he was teasing or not he is still a big fan and it was just truly appreciated if there is a better entertainer in the world i dont know who it is he is the new frank sinatra it appears he can do everything and i was really impressed with that
486865 ive been working on my jump shot it makes me feel more comfortable to shoot in a game its fun
486866 how do mothers with more than 1 kid do it
486867 rasean and his family have decided that the time is right for him to begin his professional basketball career and we wish him all the best
486868 things got out of hand in an argument over seats in the departure lounge and several people were involved in an altercation
486869 i told the guys im not looking forward to orlando
486870 im really not i told wake assistant jeff battle that i dont want to stay in the same hotel that skip and i stayed when we were there
486871 i was in philadelphia for the reebok classic at the beginning of the month and i ran into rhode island coach
486872 he said this is the last place i talked to skip
486873 the wake forest staff was in las vegas yesterday and every year we always stay at the marriott suites there we always meet in the morning for breakfast saint josephs coach
486874 its amazing how many people he touched that remember all those things
486875 were going to get dressed up and have a little memorial for him
486876 coach gaudio would yell but it wasnt anything like coach prosser yelling he always said when i stop yelling at you thats when you should worry
486877 skip would be proud of the kids because of how hard they worked and how mentally tough they were through difficult times
486878 he would be proud of how much better we were defensively
486879 the coaching staff said they were still recruiting them really hard they told them the whole team was still here and they didnt lose anybody if any of the coaches had left that probably would have hurt us
486880 if you dont have a floater a tear drop or a pull up game its going to be hard to get layups on us
486881 we have a lot of depth at the big man position
486882 i never would have gotten here without him we wouldnt be here without him
486883 ernies acknowledgement of the role that his staff has played in the programs success reached the point that he was willing to deflect substantial personal gain to aid the continued growth of the program
486884 that speaks a lot not only for the commitment he has for his players and staff but also the university and this community
486885 i am honored to have been the head basketball coach at the university of oregon for the last 11 years
486886 but our work here has just started i want to build on the momentum and excitement that has been generated from our recent success and take this program to the next level
486887 i watched the whole game for the first time about two weeks ago it was on espn classic hey you learn from your mistakes
486888 i just remember that we blew a big opportunity for us for the school me being a freshman at that time i really didnt know that a lot can happen in that much time on the clock im thinking the game is over next thing you know flanigan laughs
486889 i relaxed on the play and he got behind me i thought teammates would knock down the inbound pass but they mistimed the jump the guy caught it and tipped it to bryce and by that time it was too late for me to get to him
486890 every time they show the game i get phone calls folks joke with me all the time about it theyve been on me hard from day one it was harder to take back then than it is now its been years but its still in the back of my head that if i didnt lose him but there were a lot of plays down the stretch that we didnt make or we wouldnt have been in that situation
486891 the goal is eventually to be a division i head coach but im comfortable with where i am right now i want continue to build on what weve started
486892 we were 16 8 last year we didnt do badly we were third in our league we started off like 12 1 then lost five in a row in conference we had a lot of talent but we had some discipline problems
486893 if derrick is willing to grow up in the game of life and we can help him realize his potential then we are there to help him
486894 we expect him to get a job pay for school on his own get in shape and abide by the other steps i have reviewed with him if he measures up then he can earn his way back but that remains to be seen
486895 it was never about money for us because we really wanted to go to alaska
486896 an ovc team has won that tournament austin peay in 2000 and we thought we could go up there and be successful
486897 the logistics for an east coast team are challenging it sounds great when you sign up for it but the reality is its tough for pre conference dates
486898 i woke up in my hotel room in indianapolis and under the door was the ncaa news division ii members such as ua fairbanks dont get to vote on division i legislation my immediate thought was this will probably be the end of tournaments like ours
486899 he said our event has a 30 year history and a tv contract more ticket sales and resources and larger sponsorships so this change will get your tournament first
486900 it certainly has been a big part of our community
486901 basketball is big in rural alaska i know the top of the world classic was something we all looked forward to it came at a time of year when theres not a lot to do here and to enjoy that quality of basketball was just great for us its a big disappointment that its gone
486902 we were hearing of teams getting offered more than 100 000 to play and we realized we needed to do something
486903 so we started offering more money we signed ucf on april 16 2008 we gave them 20 000 plus 20 plane tickets 36 room nights a rental vehicle and the per diem it was 20 000 more than we had ever offered
486904 wed had a 12 year history of offering the same thing and now we were well over 60 000
486905 its like a punch in the gut i felt like this is not what college sports are supposed to be about
486906 preseason certified events were limited to outlying areas before the ncaa rule change they said they wanted to level the playing field but its not level for us if another tournament is offering 60 000 in cash to come down the road we have to offer 80 000 or more to get them here for us it created a disadvantage we cant afford to play that game
486907 im extremely happy for him to come back but i wanted him to make that decision
486908 some coaches do it for selfish reasons i love him like a son i appreciate his loyalty to me as a coach
486909 he had incredible workouts and played well in orlando at the nba pre draft camp but no one would guarantee hed be a first round pick
486910 theres no doubt in my mind robert would have been a first rounder after seeing the way the draft went
486911 it made me sad for him after watching the draft because there wasnt a better shooter in the whole draft but hes more than just a shooter hes working hard and next year hes going to have a great year for him and this team
486912 he gave me a workout plan and said if i do this every day it would make me that much better
486913 i stuck to it i took 3 4 days off at the end of the season and then we started
486914 i was around 200 205 in orlando i felt a lot quicker
486915 a lot of agility stuff jumping up on boxes working with bands we also did lots of squats and were trying to open up my hips so i can be more athletic and play better defense
486916 last summer id make a thousand jump shots a day
486917 this summer its 500 maybe 600 or 700 i do just about everything off the dribble only like 100 200 are catch and shoot
486918 not necessarily but probably so because ill be trying to get to the basket a little more
486919 i also want to create more for my teammates but ill always use my shot to my advantage
486920 i didnt go to the basket too much last year and im not going to try to force the issue if its not there im not going to do it but if i can i will im trying to expand my game
486921 i think it was disappointing seeing how the draft went but its not a bad situation
486922 as far as the nba i felt like i didnt want to settle i feel like im a first round player and im going to keep working to get to that level
486923 we have been registering for years a loss of police authority and a rapid sinking of a lack of restraint
486924 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
486925 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
486926 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
486927 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
486928 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
486929 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
486930 on the xbox and things like that to see if they can help with the presbyopia a condition in which the eye lens lose their ability to focus properly that i seem to be suffering from
486931 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
486932 blade 2 had been slimmed down so that its wonderful visuals hadnt been diluted if id had the chance to watch
486933 300 is here because it is the one that i have watched the most having said that that something is easy to park your ass in front of doesnt necessarily mean it has longevity i will say that inconsistencies aside i think its a pretty good self aware action movie
486934 the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford

487069 the scholar the academic has really come to enjoy the whole thing and i think thats appreciated by the kids
487070 but the thing i found most interesting which theyve never done before at world youth day was the u s bishops celebrated a special mass with all the pilgrims from the united states

487076 most people of faith have felt let down and abandoned by their high ranking religious leaders when the words do not specifically address the local lived experiences that church going family have here in arizona

487262 welcome to the world of the not too bitter or twisted
487263 hopefully as that finishes and the bid gets into full swing with rubbish trash removal and maybe street trees it will become a more attractive stretch for pedestrians and new business
487264 so let me get this straight what you advocate supporting and fixing up fulton street but you are against bids
487265 and what the f k does the price of sushi on 5th ave have to do with a vacant property on fulton street brownstoner was not dissing the property as much as the seeming a hole who is trying to flip it for so much more than he bought it for without fixing it
487266 you know something brownstoner fulton st could benefit from this blog why you dont promote the business on fulton st there is plenty of upside for this stretch
487267 ok wader you want to see things the asshat way thats ok homebboy but leave me out of it just let me prove my points and just skip over my posts ok good
487268 i think you have a fairly narrow definition of troll if the what doesnt fit but you are right people come here to engage so engage i will i have made several attempts to actually discuss with the what the merits of what he is saying without he she they actually rising to occasion

487277 we will develop one lesson or unit that is tailored specifically to each of the right brained traits explained by daniel pink in a whole new mind
487278 we will place priority on right brained thinking skills in our teacher evaluation process this year
487279 but i think you and i have different definitions for vision statements like many conversations on education we lack a shared vocabulary which makes shared thinking challenging
487280 how can we learn more about this together so we can come up with a new understanding for both of us
487281 how can i show everyone that my ideas are right what evidence can i use to support my thinking or to debunk my opponent
487282 portals through which new knowledge about teaching and learning can enter schools
487283 if mr ferriter can do all those wonderful things with his kids why cant you
487284 and what about the kids from families who just dont care im not about to promise to ensure anything that i cant control
487285 guys i actually believe in you if i didnt think that you could ensure high student achievement you wouldnt be sitting in this room right now
487286 more importantly ensuring high student achievement is the right thing to do isnt it shouldnt the parents of our students know that we are going to do more than just give it the good ol college try the success of their children is too important to just hope that teachers are striving for excellence
487287 ensuring the learning of every student requires more than compliance however learning for all students requires deep levels of commitment from all stakeholders and that is nurtured through principals developing relationships with teachers that foster trust integrity collaboration and ownership the ambitious mission of learning for all can only be accomplished through the deep commitment of teachers
487288 can you show me how this ensures high student achievement or values the unique needs of every learner
487289 both their words and their actions convey what must be tight in their schools and districts those imperatives that all staff members are expected to observe and honor furthermore they do not hesitate to insist that staff act in accordance with the purpose and priorities of the organization they are vigilant in protecting against the erosion of core values empathetically assertive when necessary they are not weak leaders quite the contrary they are strong leaders who demonstrate a different kind of strength than the authoritarian control of traditional hierarchies they enlist colleagues in a fundamentally moral endeavor making a difference in the lives of students and then work with those colleagues collectively and collaboratively to succeed in that endeavor
487290 an effective vision statement articulates a vivid picture of the organizations future that is so compelling that a schools members will be motivated to work together to make it a reality
487291 this is who we are is it who you are if not theres no need to move forward with our interview
487292 if our learning team is going to be successful at creating a collaborative community ensuring high student achievement and valuing the unique needs of each learner we must articulate what each of those terms looks like in action
487293 encourages student centered exploration of content rather than teacher driven presentations

487297 no one now gives two hoots for the size of the current account deficit
487298 remember the previous recession we had to have was because the economic wisdom was that the balance of payments current account deficit was too big no one now gives two hoots for the size of the current account deficit

487317 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
487318 questions should be asked to define whether the proposition proposed is consistent with known facts
487319 if there really was any evidence that carbon emissions caused global warming dont you think we would have heard all about it ad naseum by now
487320 the onus is on those who want to change things to provide evidence for why the changes are necessary
487321 third the satellites that measure the worlds temperature all say that the warming trend ended in 2001 that 1998 was the warmest recent year and that the temperature has dropped about 0 6c in the last year to the temperature of 1980

487326 previously reported discrepancies between the amount of warming near the surface and higher in the atmosphere have been used to challenge the reliability of climate models and the reality of human induced global warming this significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite and radiosonde data have been identified and corrected while these data are consistent with the results from climate models at the global scale discrepancies in the tropics remain to be resolved this difference between models and observations may arise from errors that are common to all models from errors in the observational data sets or from a combination of these factors the second explanation is favored but the issue is still open
487327 dr david evans who was a key member of the australian greenhouse gas office has stated with evidence that the actual measured carbon dioxide greenhouse signal in the atmosphere is missing
487328 human generated carbon dioxide is around 3 percent of the total carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
487329 geoscience data e g sediments ice refutes the contention that human carbon dioxide has any significant role in our natural climate change
487330 your second point there is actually an incredible overwhelming amount of evidence that co2 creates a warming effect
487331 deliberately wrecking the economy for the reasons that later turn out to be bogus hardly seems like a recipe for electoral success
487332 enough oil has already been discovered around the world to maintain consumption at current levels for another 42 years
487333 wont be affected by the uncertaintly amp potential economic catastrophe
487334 mnimising carbon pollution will create an incentive for solar and wind which means clean air and water
487335 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
487336 when there was a higher of atmospheric co2 in ages past there were many more forests
487337 ever wonder how all those billions of tonnes of coal and oil got down there in the first place or what got fossilised into fossil fuels
487338 the scientific consensus is that it cannot be established that the recession of
487339 first the new ice cores shows that in the past six global warmings over the past half a million years the temperature rises occurred on average 800 years before the accompanying rise in atmospheric carbon
487340 second there is now no evidence to support the idea that carbon emissions cause significant global warming none
487341 the fact that no coupled model simulation so far has reproduced global temperature changes over the 20th century without anthropogenic forcing is strong evidence for the influence of humans on global climate
487342 comparisons of model outputs to observed results are not evidence because they cannot prove that the model is always right only that it was right in some instances
487343 third the satellites that measure the worlds temperature all say that the warming trend ended in 2001 that 1998 was the warmest recent year and that the temperature has dropped about 0 6c in the last year to the temperature of 1980
487344 land based temperature readings are corrupted by the urban heat island effect
487345 fourth we looked for the greenhouse signature and could not find it
487346 the later which is arguablely what we are experiencing can be adequately explained by natural variation
487347 it can be said with a high level of confidence that global mean surface temperature was higher during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period during the preceding four centuries this statement is justified by the consistency of the evidence from a wide variety of geographically diverse proxies less confidence can be placed in large scale surface temperature reconstructions for the period from a d 900 to 1600 presently available proxy evidence indicates that temperatures at many but not all individual locations were higher during the past 25 years than during any period of comparable length since a d 900 the uncertainties associated with reconstructing hemispheric mean or global mean temperatures from these data increase substantially backward in time through this period and are not yet fully quantified
487348 the ipcc centre piece the mann hockey stick graph has been discredited
487349 models are tuned using hindcasting and only can be verified by seeing if the future predictions bear out
487350 your only argument in favor of this is that modelling predicts it
487351 computer models and theoretical calculations are not evidence they are just theory comparisons of model outputs to observed results are not evidence because they cannot prove that the model is always right only that it was right in some instances
487352 david evans wrote the climate modelling software for the australian greenhouse office so he is very conversant with the science
487353 might be worth adding that even if he were a scientist of sorts it is always important to examine published works funding sources institution private investment interests and other areas of connection before assuming the information you are receiving is independent and thoroughly reviewed
487354 has csiro been given money to research how to change primary production
487355 have governments stopped giving building permits close to beaches in case the sea rises
487356 or are governments simply paying some half hearted lip service to populist movements
487357 has csiro been given money to research how to change primary production
487358 might be worth pointing out that david is a software developer not a climatologist
487359 no theory can certainly predict the future thats why they are called theorys and not facts
487360 thus at bottom it is very difficult to separate human induced change from natural change certainly not with the confidence we all seek in these circumstances it is essential to remember that the inability to prove human induced change is not the same thing as a demonstration of its absence it is probably true that most scientists would assign a very high probability that human induced change is already strongly present in the climate system while at the same time agreeing that clear cut proof is not now available and may not be available for a long time to come if ever public policy has to be made on the basis of probabilities not firm proof
487361 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
487362 those arent computer models those are facts ice needs the input of additional heat to melt co2 is a greenhouse gas provide me with concrete evidence and its reputable source that there is a non agw cause for this and ill be more than willing to look into it
487363 careful studies over the last 20 years show that its overall brightness and energy output increases slightly as sunspot activity rises to the peak of its 11 year cycle
487364 thus the available evidence indicates that artifacts in radiosonde wind observations are only a small source of uncertainty in our results although the issue deserves further attention
487365 it can be said with a high level of confidence that global mean surface temperature was higher during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period during the preceding four centuries this statement is justified by the consistency of the evidence from a wide variety of geographically diverse proxies less confidence can be placed in large scale surface temperature reconstructions for the period from a d 900 to 1600 presently available proxy evidence indicates that temperatures at many but not all individual locations were higher during the past 25 years than during any period of comparable length since a d 900 the uncertainties associated with reconstructing hemispheric mean or global mean temperatures from these data increase substantially backward in time through this period and are not yet fully quantified
487366 the signature of increased greenhouse warming is a hot spot 10 km up in the atmosphere over the tropics
487367 david has chosen to latch on to the major error in the modeling to support his argument

487372 why does every gw proponent have to be politically ecnomically motivated as you claim
487373 the fundamental conclusion that todays concentrations of these greenhouse gases have no past analogue in the ice core record remains firm
487374 the remarkably strong correlations of methane and carbon dioxide with temperature reconstructions also stand
487375 first the new ice cores shows that in the past six global warmings over the past half a million years the temperature rises occurred on average 800 years before the accompanying rise in atmospheric carbon

487381 fourth we looked for the greenhouse signature and could not find it
487382 the alp is going to be regarded as criminally negligent for not having seen through it
487383 the onus is on those who want change things to provide evidence for why the changes are necessary
487384 there is plenty of evidence that global warming has occurred
487385 now we can get down to the debate about emmissions gaseous and particulate in particular who in their right mind would want to breath the airs of mumbai or beijing everyday

487401 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
487402 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
487403 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
487404 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
487405 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
487406 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
487407 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
487408 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
487409 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
487410 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
487411 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
487412 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
487413 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
487414 your not going to tell me you ran out of gas are you thats the oldest trick in the book and im not falling for it

487417 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
487418 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
487419 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
487420 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
487421 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
487422 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
487423 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
487424 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
487425 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
487426 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
487427 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
487428 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
487429 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
487430 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
487431 who are open to doing something on the production side
487432 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
487433 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
487434 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
487435 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
487436 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
487437 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
487438 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
487439 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
487440 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
487441 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
487442 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
487443 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
487444 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
487445 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
487446 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
487447 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
487448 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
487449 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
487450 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
487451 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
487452 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
487453 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
487454 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
487455 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
487456 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
487457 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
487458 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
487459 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
487460 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
487461 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
487462 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
487463 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
487464 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
487465 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
487466 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
487467 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
487468 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
487469 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
487470 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
487471 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
487472 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
487473 import error the xml parser could not parse the opml data

487475 the same goes for dominic waldouck taking his kicking to the next level
487476 here is my heart keep it safe amp please dont break it
487477 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
487478 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
487479 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
487480 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
487481 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
487482 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
487483 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
487484 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
487485 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
487486 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
487487 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
487488 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
487489 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
487490 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
487491 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
487492 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
487493 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
487494 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
487495 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
487496 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
487497 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
487498 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
487499 im used to getting a great deal of money for my district
487500 how much is the city paying for the building while its empty
487501 the citys been paying about 15 000 a month while the building has been empty
487502 i dont think the rule should have any attention paid to it becaus sic in congress we have our own rules
487503 but its not really free taxpayers are paying for it
487504 but it doesnt cause any difficulty to the community to take the money
487505 its taxpayers money in my view the congressman looks at federal earmarks the 5 6 million as play money

487548 the major obstacle for amateur film makers is their own sense of inferiority vis a vis professional productions the very classification amateur has an apologetic ring but that very word from the latin amator lover means one who does something for the love of the thing rather than for economic reasons or necessity and this is the meaning from which the amateur film maker should take his cue instead of envying the script and dialogue writers the trained actors the elaborate staffs and sets the enormous production budgets of the professional film the amateur should make use of the one great advantage which all professionals envy him namely freedom both artistic and physical artistic freedom means that the amatuer film maker is never forced to sacrifice visual drama and beauty to a stream of words words words words to the relentless activity and explanations of a plot or to the display of a star or sponsors product nor is the amateur production expected to return profit on a huge investment by holding the attention of a massive and motley audience for 90 minutes like the amateur still photographer the amateur film maker can devote himself to capturing the poetry and beauty of places and events and since he is using a motion picture camera he can explore the vast world of the beauty movement instead of trying to invent a plot that moves use the movement of wind or water children people elevators balls etc as a poem might celebrate these and use your freedom to experiment with visual ideas your mistakes will not get you fired physical freedom includes time freedom a freedom from budget imposed deadlines but above all the amateur film maker with his small lightweight equipment has an inconspicuousness for candid shooting and a physical mobility which is well the envy of most professionals burdened as they are by their manyton monsters cables and crews dont forget that no trypod has yet been built which is as miraculously versatile in movement as the complex system of supports joints muscles and nerves which is the human body which with a bit of practice makes possible the enormous variety of camera angles and visual action you have all this and a brain too in one neat compact mobile package cameras do not make films film makers make films improve your films not by adding more equipment and personnel but by using what you have to its fullest capacity the most important part of your equipment is yourself your mobile body your imaginative mind and your freedom to use both make sure you do use them

487575 we have always asked nascar for a nationwide race or a truck race and theres never been room in the schedule
487576 now theres room in the schedule nascar has not called me up and said hey were going to go to iowa they have said they really like our track they like what it looks like
487577 at this point im not going to speculate ive got my fingers crossed i hope we get it but they have never come up to me and said youre getting it heres the date were absolutely 100 percent at their mercy
487578 i raced there in late models and theres three grooves in late models id hate to see what itd do in a nationwide car it would open up pretty good
487579 rusty did a nice job designing the place everything from the track surface to the campgrounds and the stands and the club seats the bus lot every garage has a drain for your cool down units so you dont have water all over the place everything is so nice and state of the art youd be crazy not to go there
487580 theres been some very small spots that we put some material on thats like a paint
487581 weve just painted over and it seals the aggregate together weve had some small spots that weve worked with similar to the situation we had last year in turn 10
487582 our first effort would be to run in the dry if possible
487583 we have the cars prepared for rain we have our rain tires that are available to us we have the wiper motors the lights the blowers the teams can put rain x on so the teams are prepared to run in the event of rain
487584 if we would have a situation where rain would occur where we would deem it necessary to go to the rain option we would probably put a caution out maybe even call it a red flag bring the teams onto pit road make the changeover and then put them back on the race course
487585 well run rain or shine i really feel like the race is going to be long theres going to be a lot of cautions the weather is going to be unpredictable its going to create a lot of change in the outcome of the race im sure
487586 if its raining and youre still on track at the end of the race youve got a pretty good chance to win this thing
487587 if it rains its going to be hard to tell whats going to happen
487588 its going to be a very difficult race but very exciting for the crowd so if it rains dont stay home come and youll have a good show
487589 that procedure is something we want to get a lot of input on before we make that decision
487590 were on such a big race track where it could potentially be raining at one end of the track and not at the other so were going to look at all the elements before we make a decision on how we come back to a tire changeover

487740 today the democrat majority of congress adjourned for a five week vacation without taking a vote on bipartisan measures that would lessen our dependence on foreign oil by allowing more domestic drilling on the outer continental shelf
487741 the american people wont get a vacation from high gasoline prices so congress shouldnt take a vacation until we vote to lessen our dependence on foreign oil
487742 since the speaker has decided not to keep the house in session to allow this vote i renew my call for president bush to convene an immediate energy special session of congress
487743 if 4 per gallon gas isnt an extraordinary occasion that demands action by the congress i dont know what is the president should immediately bring the congress back into session to do its job and give the bipartisan pro drilling majority a vote
487744 the american people know the only way to lessen our dependence on foreign oil is to lessen our dependence on foreign oil by giving the american people more access to american oil i say to my countrymen and colleagues in congress drill more drill now and well pay less
487745 mr president the democrat congress is leaving town for five weeks without voting on more drilling use your constitutional authority bring em back and make em work right here right now the american people deserve no less

487764 its just of a matter of what he wants more is playing more important or keeping those guys out of the friction that would come if he reports
487765 mark murphy had talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing

487773 ich bin es hier leider schon so gewohnt nicht an der spitze zu liegen dass ich es vorgezogen habe die f hrung zu verteidigen das hat sich als gute entscheidung herausgestellt obwohl ich heute vom start bis ins ziel wieder richtig pushen musste die pisten waren stellenweise feucht und haben guten grip geboten das hat auch f r chancengleichheit gesorgt und wir konnten vollgas geben auf den trockeneren abschnitten lag aber loser schotter und das war ein nachteil weil wir dort selbst zeit verloren haben und gleichzeitig eine linie f r die anderen gezogen haben ich denke aber dass wir mit dem problem ganz gut umgegangen sind und wir konnten unseren vorsprung von 14 4 auf 18 2 sekunden ausbauen
487774 auf ber 160 kilometern mit vollgas zwischen den b umen hindurch 3 6 sekunden dazu zu gewinnen war nicht einfach
487775 auf ber 160 kilometern mit vollgas zwischen den b umen hindurch 3 6 sekunden dazu zu gewinnen war nicht einfach aber eine fantastische leistung es war so eng dass ich die vorstellung dass ich gewinnen oder ein top resultat holen k nnte das mich in der weltmeisterschaft wieder nach vorn bringt einfach aus meinem kopf gestrichen habe ich habe mich nur darauf konzentriert keine fehler zu machen und meinen vorsprung zu halten das ist uns gelungen und der speed unseres c4 wrc wird morgen eine unserer trumpfkarten sein auch wenn es lieber extrem vorsichtig angehe
487776 ich hatte volles vertrauen in mein auto aber ich wollte in den neuen pr fungen nicht zu viel riskieren ich habe mich dazu entschieden platz vier und damit viele punkte f r die herstellerwertung zu sichern ich habe immer noch einen tag um zu versuchen aufs podium zu springen
487777 ein franzose in finnland auf dem treppchen w re nicht so gut ich muss versuchen das zu verhindern
487778 was f r ein wahnsinnstag das hat so spa gemacht und der speed war einfach verr ckt ich habe berall vollgas gegeben bin gro e risiken eingegangen und die pace war heute schneller als im vergangenen jahr in einer pr fung habe ich vergangenes jahr einen rekord hingelegt heute morgen war ich dort zehn sekunden schneller und in der zweiten durchfahrt noch einmal sieben sekunden schneller und ich war noch nicht einmal der schnellste ich bin loeb linien hinterhergefahren und konnte sehen dass auch er am limit war es ist ein fantastischer und sehr intensiver fight
487779 jede sekunde die ich gut gemacht habe hat er mir in der n chsten pr fung wieder abgenommen auf den morgigen schnellen pisten kann viel passieren aber nur durch fahren werde ich so viel zeit nur schwer aufholen k nnen entweder brauche ich gl ck oder er braucht pech ein franzose in finnland auf dem treppchen w re nicht so gut ich muss versuchen das zu verhindern
487780 heute morgen war es schwierig und ich habe mich nach dem gestrigen unfall auch nicht besonders wohl gef hlt in der ersten pr fung heute bin ich weit nach au en gekommen und im graben h ngengeblieben aber danach lief es besser und ich habe mein selbstvertrauen zur ckgewonnen ich bin schnell gefahren aber auf eine sichere art schnell und das fahren beginnt mir wieder spa zu machen wenn ich in der lage w re um etwas zu k mpfen k nnte ich es nun w hrend sich heute morgen gar nichts gut angef hlt hat
487781 jari matti hat die gelegenheit genutzt bestzeiten zu holen und somit sein selbstvertrauen zur ckzugewinnen das ist gut f r die n chste rallye mikko hat den ganzen tag ber 100 prozent gegeben aber leider konnte er auf loeb keine zeit gut machen aber noch ist es nicht vorbei und morgen erwartet uns noch einmal ein aufregender tag
487782 es war ein guter tag und wenn man sich den fight um platz drei anschaut dann hatten wir genau die richtige pace wir hatten keine probleme wir pushen immer noch und es war wirklich gut f r uns dass wir die zeit aufholen und dritte werden konnten es ist gut f r das team dass wir da sind wo wir sind und ein paar gute zeiten fahren konnten die zwei jungs vor mir sind wirklich klasse und fahren in ihrer eigenen liga aber wir werden morgen noch einmal alles geben damit wir da bleiben wo wir sind dani ist auf den pisten die er kennt schnell und wir scheinen in den neuen pr fungen aufzuholen deshalb wird es nicht einfach
487783 das auto war heute zwischenzeitlich ganz gut aber dann schien ich das feeling wieder zu verlieren die balance war nicht so schlecht aber es gab momente in denen ich das gef hl hatte dass ich einfach nicht pushen kann das ist frustrierend aber ich fahre so schnell wie ich kann ich versuche es wirklich heute lag viel loser schotter auf den pisten morgen wird es auch so sein deshalb m ssen wir einfach abwarten
487784 das ist frustrierend aber ich fahre so schnell wie ich kann
487785 wir haben heute auf diesen schnellen pisten mit dem weichen schotter definitive einen schritt nach vorn gemacht dass chris bis auf platz drei geklettert ist ist beeindruckend wir lernen mit dem neuen auto immer dazu und der heutige tag hat ganz klar gezeigt dass ergebnisse irgendwann folgen werden
487786 es war ein schwieriger tag ich fahre aggressiv und in den schnellen sektionen sind meine zeiten wirklich gut und das auto f hlt sich gut an aber auf den engen pisten habe ich probleme und finde keinen guten rhythmus das gef hl ist nicht so wie gestern ich dachte eigentlich dass mir die neuen pr fungen heute entgegenkommen aber das war nicht der fall wir hatten ein paar schrecksekunden vor allem in der kurve in der gigi abgeflogen ist deshalb bin ich in dieser sehr schwierigen aber auch sehr schnellen pr fung vom gas gegangen der plan f r morgen ist das auto sicher ins ziel zu bringen wir k nnen immer noch einige punkte holen
487787 das auto hat sich dann mit hoher geschwindigkeit berschlagen und ist in die b ume geflogen
487788 alles in allem bin ich froh diesen harten tag ohne gr ere dramen berlebt zu haben die letzte pr fung war vielleicht meine beste und ich konnte auch ein paar von den finnischen jungs schlagen bei dieser rallye ist es gut wenn die bedingungen konstant sind aber das war heute nicht der fall deshalb bin ich happy dass ich ohne probleme durchgekommen bin
487789 die rallye ist f r mich mit einer bitteren entt uschung zu ende gegangen ich habe nur versucht meine position gegen daniel sordo zu verteidigen und der unfall ist in einer t ckischen linkskurve passiert mein aufschrieb hat nicht ganz gepasst und es hat damit geendet dass ich in den graben gerutscht bin das auto hat sich dann mit hoher geschwindigkeit berschlagen und ist in die b ume geflogen das auto ist schwer besch digt und es war offensichtlich eine kurve die es in sich hatte denn an der selben stelle sind noch zwei andere autos abgeflogen wir hatten einen guten rhythmus einen vern nftigen speed und ein gutes gef hl f r das auto deshalb denke ich nicht dass ich dort zu sehr gepusht habe
487790 wir wollten hier punkte holen aber so ist es eben manchmal im sport
487791 mein arm hat mir heute manchmal ein bisschen weh getan aber ansonsten war es ein guter tag die pr fungen haben mir spa gemacht wie immer bei dieser rallye ich wollte kein risiko eingehen da ich und das team die punkte brauchen und das ist auch das ziel f r morgen aber matthew wilson war nicht weit hinter mir und ich musste sicherstellen dass er mich nicht berholt

487813 has really become a symbol for a lot of conservative grievances

487833 the efforts of some very passionate aids activists are paying off in mexico with mercks announcement of significant price cuts on two of its aids drugs stocrin and isentress
487834 though there is still much to be done in the fight for affordable lifesaving aids drugs in mexico and throughout the world including further advocacy focusing on merck we commend merck today for instituting these double digit price reductions in response to activists pleas for lower prices as a means to increase access to antiretroviral treatment throughout mexico we want to ensure that people in need in mexico are not arbitrarily priced out of such lifesaving aids treatments and we will continue to vigorously advocate both government and industry for universal access to antiretroviral treatment
487835 merck will still charge 1 51 usd per patient per day for stocrin in mexico while the drug is available in brazil a country with a similar per capita income for roughly 50 cents per day we have challenged merck before for charging four times as much as they do in other latin american and middle income countries for drugs like stocrin steep pricing effectively makes these drugs all but out of reach for nearly all those living with hiv aids in mexico
487836 over the past year ahf and a growing coalition of aids activists here in mexico have undertaken efforts to make policy makers and the public at large aware of the imbalance in mercks policies regarding the pricing of its aids drugs as compared to how merck prices the same drugs in what are considered least developed countries we also need to continue to push merck on the registration and pricing of the three in one once a day combination therapy atripla to make certain that people in need in mexico and elsewhere have access to this lifesaving regimen

487899 for me to be able to handle my 50 year old wife sleeping in a bed with a 19 year old boyfriend and using my gym and driving my cars and living in my house i guess weve got a pretty good act going on cause thats a lot to take on

487918 de ninguna manera creo que la campa a de john mccain sea racista creo que es c nica

487922 we know that the public at large is grieving the loss
487923 we know that more suffering is visited upon this earth every time we swat a fly than when we kill a three day human embryo
487924 on one had with have this collection of 50 150 cells and on the other we have little girls suffering from diabetes and full body burns we men and women with parkinsons disease we have literally tens of millions of people suffering terrible torments which could one day be remediated by this research
487925 but how do we understand at what point consciousness enters the embryo this is problematic a fetus which is becoming a human is already a sentient being but a fertilized egg may actually bifurcate into 8 16 32 64 cells and become an embryo
487926 in some areas buddhism may have a different perspective from secular ethics i think for example about human rights from the buddhist viewpoint it is very difficult to claim that we human beings have special rights that are categorically different from animal rights
487927 im not the person who can say anything about that
487928 but i do believe the club are working hard to get a solution
487929 we knew it was going to be a very complicated matter that it was not easy
487930 its not going to be easy for ronaldo to come to real madrid
487931 do i still want to sign ronaldo what a question of course if you ask any football coach that question every single one of them would want ronaldo
487932 every coach has a lot of objectives and he is a player who would help you achieve those objectives
487933 to be fair to nicky shorey he has made it clear from this time last year that he would prefer to leave and ply his trade elsewhere
487934 we as a club have an asset and it is a delicate balancing act between trying to satisfy the demands of the player and also trying to satisfy the demands of the football club
487935 we had a good talk yesterday there was a little bit of interest last week and the chances are he will be gone by next week i am 60 40 convinced that he will be gone
487936 the offer was a firm one but we have no need to sell anyone and im not going to give anyone away
487937 it has to be a realistic bid in terms of market valuation and bear in mind that 12 months ago he was coming off the back of playing two games for england against brazil and germany
487938 i dont feel disposed to let him go for nothing i appreciate it is a year on from that particular moment but as yet the valuation is not what we find acceptable
487939 two bob is miles away as far as i am concerned if it is not meeting the valuation then it is a long way away
487940 i have been fairly fair with shorsey and he accepts the situation so clarity would be best for everybody
487941 we are in that ridiculous situation that if nobody comes in for him then he will still be here
487942 i would dearly love him to be playing for us as he is a significant player for us
487943 so there are about three balls up in the air for us and it is unsatisfactory for him for us and for everybody
487944 we do not have any strikers apart from wayne rooney and carlos tevez and frazier plays in that area
487945 he took his goal really well today and that wont do him any harm
487946 he is a progressive young player he is quick and determined and he can do very well in the game
487947 i could probably bring ole on for the last 10 minutes even now and he wouldnt let us down
487948 it was a very emotional day for him and fully deserved
487949 i would like to have scored but unfortunately it wasnt to be
487950 i have had many highs and lows and i cant think him enough for the way he stuck by me fantasy cricket

487962 very disappointed that the investigation into baileys death has not made any progress
487963 instead the case has become more complicated as aspects surrounding the motives for baileys murder have been unleashed evidence some recorded by the police and some uncovered by investigative reporters points at someone other than the currently accused defendant broussard as a potential perpetrator s and or mastermind s of the crime and suggests that local police officials may be protecting those responsible for mr baileys death
487964 conduct an independent investigation and assume the prosecution of those responsible for the murder of chauncey bailey
487965 i have no question whatsoever that my office can prosecute this case professionally and competently
487966 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate

487968 the total amount of suffering in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation during the minute it takes me to say these words thousands of animals are running for their lives whimpering with fear feeling teeth sink into their throats thousands are dying from starvation or disease or feeling a parasite rasping away from within there is no central authority no safety net for most animals the reality of life is struggling suffering and death

488059 study reveals signs of toxicity of ge maize approved for human consumption
488060 laboratory rats fed with a genetically engineered ge maize produced by monsanto have shown signs of toxicity in kidney and liver according to a new study
488061 monsantos analyses do not stand up to rigorous scrutiny to begin with their statistical protocols are highly questionable worse the company failed to run a sufficient analysis of the differences in animal weight crucial data from urine tests were concealed in the companys own publications
488062 this is the final nail in the coffin for the credibility of the current authorisation system for ge products once its known that a system designed to protect human and animal health has approved a high risk product despite clear evidence of its dangers we need to start strip searching all ge products on the market and immediately abort this flawed approval procedure

488070 these two sets of fears came together in a perfect storm that was pushed forward by a surplus of hot air from talk show hosts on radio and television
488071 in the face of this criticism the bush administration was silent and the democratic candidates competed for votes in the rust belt states where unions and many working people have come to see nafta and globalization much as commentator lou dobbs does

488148 we dont know why they didnt implement it this government has implemented many ordinances without consultation
488149 in coming days europe will require skilled manpower so well have to emphasise on education
488150 the caretaker government will have to exercise unquestionable neutrality in the ensuing elections and they will have to ensure that the elections are held in free fair and peaceful manner however it is the principal responsibility of the election commission ec to make the polls fair and meaningful formulation of appropriate legal framework and their full impartial and strict implementation fall under the ecs responsibilities however a fair and acceptable election is not possible in any way without the cooperation and responsible behaviour of the political parties and the candidates participating in the polls the role of the conscious citizens is also very important but the role played by the concerned quarters over the ensuing election was very unfortunate and already questionable
488151 we make earnest request to the voters of 13 city corporations and pourashavas to cast their ballots tomorrow applying their conscience and thought we also request them to cast their votes in favour of honest eligible and dedicated candidates because the preconditions of a truly democratic system are the thoughtful and right decision of the voters in the past many of us did not take right decision while casting our ballots and we are now paying the prices for those mistakes
488152 if this is done it will be tantamount to selling out ones conscience we will have no scope to make complaint in the next five years we will also have no right to protest the activities of any leader because they will be elected for our wrong decisions

488158 south asia is home to almost half of the worlds poor global economic slowdown soaring oil and food prices and growing threats of climate change are driving the destitute people of the region even further bellow the poverty line
488159 we must redouble our efforts to attain the saarc development goals within the targeted timeline i believe national action on poverty alleviation should be complemented by effective and robust regional initiatives in order to have penetrative impact on poverty reduction in south asia
488160 this requires our immediate attention to ensure constant and steady supply of food for our people
488161 this is a must to prevent hunger and malnutrition one of the key priorities of all nations and of the millennium development goals
488162 we have already agreed to move towards a south asian customs union and a south asian economic union in a planned and phased manner
488163 we should pool our resources to tap renewable sources such as solar energy hydropower and wind energy all of which south asia has in abundance
488164 this is our common responsibility to the people of south asia
488165 together with other asian countries we should consider launching a greater asia food security programme
488166 it is important to remember the element of interdependence which is crucial for a durable peace and the protection of democratic values in the region
488167 these challenges do not just prevent the realization of our potential for growth and prosperity they put our future gravely at risk
488168 it is time we focused together on fighting extremism and terrorism as the enemies we have in common
488169 global climate change policies are still driven more by eco rationale rather than all too important issue of human security
488170 millions continue to be mired in inhuman conditions of want and deprivation
488171 if we are to make reasonable headway our national efforts must complement the regional consensus and the plan of action on poverty alleviation

488174 the six month rule the things that matter most today will not matter so much in six months when you break up with someone it destroys a piece of your heart but your heart heals with time its better to part ways than try to make a doomed relationship work never take responsibility for others mistakes when people show you who they are believe them the first time never base your opinions on what you wish people could be and never make excuses to justify unacceptable actions

488215 this departmental review didnt even have the authority to get answers from julie couillard it is totally inadequate
488216 this review clearly demonstrates why an investigation that can rely upon all the powers of the inquiries act is necessary to assure canadians that national security has not been jeopardized
488217 we now know we are talking about documents that is some cases were stamped secret and nato restricted were these documents copied and disseminated to other people the government doesnt know did ms couillard have access to other classified information the government doesnt know
488218 if the government is seriously suggesting that ms couillard stole these documents out of the ministers briefcase what steps have they taken to account for all classified documents that were in mr berniers possession while he was foreign affairs minister
488219 even the government seems to be embarrassed by how useless this review was in uncovering key facts since they clumsily tired to downplay it by releasing it at 6 00pm on the friday before a long weekend
488220 the reports reveals that the prime ministers chief of staff was told of ms couillards past ties to organized crime weeks before this was in the media but the government didnt take this seriously enough to do a proper investigation
488221 it is also shocking to learn from this report that both mr bernier and his chief of staff immediately recognized how serious the failure to secure these classified documents was and yet they both chose to wait nearly 24 hours to inform the prime minister or his office despite the fact mr bernier attended a meeting with the prime minister the very next morning

488283 and if we can come up with a genuine bi partisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence then that is something i am open to
488284 i think is sic a positive step so there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bi partisan group
488285 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect for a drilling agenda
488286 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
488287 and what that means is that were going to try to get things done at some point people are going to have to make decisions are we going to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done

488324 if i go i want to be able to see ashe sometime this week i want to be able to go to the movies i want to go to the park maybe even go down to mapleton to see her so her mom doesnt have to spend gas money driving her down here
488325 okay it starts at eight so we need to leave by seven
488326 seven well maybe tell you what same plan but i get to see her twice
488327 to clear out any loopholes this is for this week any day this week this applies for one week meaning seven days from now i get to see her twice and all the above applies these terms are final set in stone but cover more space
488328 i didnt get to go cause youre a two faced bullshitter
488329 im like a grumpy old geezer with a cist on his ass a sex change and bleedin from his vagina who only had three hours of sleep
488330 if you are ready to push the publish button and you are not a little bit nervous then dont push it
488331 dreams can come true if you have the courage to pursue them
488332 e va ancora ogni mattina a trovarla anche se non sa chi lei
488333 questo il genere di amore che voglio nella mia vita
488334 the only things that bother me are the things i care about the only things that cause me anxiety are the things i dont understand

488337 i can turn any band into a commercialized piece of crap
488338 the total amount of suffering in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation during the minute it takes me to say these words thousands of animals are running for their lives whimpering with fear feeling teeth sink into their throats thousands are dying from starvation or disease or feeling a parasite rasping away from within there is no central authority no safety net for most animals the reality of life is struggling suffering and death
488339 i cant believe we just saw two men holding hands
488340 what the heck am i doing with my life anyway
488341 we need to start focusing on prosecution of domestic violence offenses as a matter of homicide prevention
488342 incarceration might have an impact but we are having trouble in maine getting the prosecution to happen
488343 too few women are screened for violence and offered the help and referrals they need
488344 theres still a sexual assault every two minutes in the united states but the violence against women act has helped focus police prosecutors and judges on the seriousness of the crime
488345 the progress shows that we need to fully fund the programs because the ones that have been funded are working
488346 i dont think we can say that violence is declining when the number of people seeking services continues to grow or stay the same
488347 it could be that the numbers arent being counted right or it could be that women have stopped using the justice system but the experience in the field is not that women are safer
488348 the national crime victimization survey is not an accurate reflection of what we know about domestic violence prevalence
488349 more than 7 700 requests for services went unmet in a 24 hour period in 2007 because there simply werent enough resources to help them
488350 but we are making progress and we can do even more

488358 the hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen but platinum works very poorly for oxygen making you use much more energy
488359 what we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy in fact with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
488360 nickel oxide cant be used around anything else in the environment because of corrosion even the carbon dioxide in the air will react with it to make carbonates
488361 but our catalyst uses abundant materials that dont react with environment
488362 because our catalyst is green the machines that perform electrolysis can be much less expensive than they are today since they dont need to be protected from environmental contaminants
488363 solar cell makers can add super cheap electrolyzers to their system so that they work 24 7 during the day making hydrogen and oxygen then at night recombining it in fuel cells to generate electricity
488364 utopian in 1974 to think of the multinational corporations as potentially among our most effective mechanisms for husbanding the earths resources and optimizing their use for human benefit the current popular image of the corporation tends to be more that of the spoiler and the exploiter
488365 we are grateful to the washington post the new york times time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years it would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the light of publicity during those years but now the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government the supra national sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries

488367 no doubt existing consciousness changing behavior shaping subliminal persuasion and other conditioning techniques could be used to accomplish some sort of transformation of sobering proportions we ought to be able to be more effective than nazi germany after previously citing nazi re invigoration of the germanic icons and ideals
488368 the appropriate question may be not so much how to bring about a transformation but rather how to facilitate a non catastrophic transformation
488369 construct a guiding version of a workable society built around a new positive image of humankind and corresponding vision of a suitable social paradigm as the old order shows increasing signs of falling apart some adequate vision of what may be simultaneously building is urgently needed for mobilization of constructive effort the guiding vision has to include some way of providing for full and valued participation in the economic and social affairs of the community and society especially for those who are physically and mentally able to contribute but find themselves in a state of unwilling idleness and deterioration of spirit

488448 in the event that the proposals go ahead we will try to minimise the impact through voluntary redundancy and redeployment to alternative positions
488449 with the reduction in advertising revenue and circulation along with the most dramatic increase in newspaper printing capacity we have ever seen in the uk it is inevitable that this will continue to happen

488477 i would have mccain serve in the role of loyal opposition in the minority

488558 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
488559 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
488560 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
488561 we have to stop rallies and marches or anything that leads to mass gatherings
488562 what they say hamas is doing in gaza they are doing here
488563 we werent able to pull it together with the offensive team
488564 the defence played well and the special teams didnt play well and neither did the offence and when you lose two out of three its difficult its just unacceptable the way we played tonight
488565 hes got a lot of potential and a good attitude and thought process ive followed him since his days at boise state
488566 youre playing a team thats giving up the rush and this wasnt good enough the average was there but the issue is the consistency tonight he dropped the punt and fumbled two balls never mind the yardage
488567 when youre the no 1 team defensively year in and year out teams have six months to watch what we do
488568 now i think weve figured out what people are trying to do to us were even now but we need to get a step ahead we just have to load the box up and take away first down and then on second down we get sacks and interceptions

488572 a recall petition may be initiated by the filing of an affidavit containing the name of the officer sought to be recalled and a statement of the grounds for recall provided that the affidavit is signed by at least fifty voters for any officer elected by precinct
488573 said petition shall be returned and filed with the town clerk within ten days after the filing of the affidavit and shall have been signed by 10 of the voters in the precinct of the officer to be recalled

488576 we do not have the luxury of time failure to act now will result in huge problems over the next 10 years with the uk reliant on imported gas and oil a situation that would be an environmental economic and political disaster
488577 this is not my preferred way to roll out anything
488578 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which were not only not hiding but were scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy

488587 i think a lot of people think they can kick and hold and snap do the things that we do and they probably could but its a tough job and there s a lot of pressure said punter terrence brown

488646 he has great instincts he understands how to play the game understands the nuances
488647 he has the ability to play multiple positions his size and footwork hes got footwork of a linebacker but its easy to project him as a defensive end because hes probably still growing
488648 we also play him at tight end because he has such good hands
488649 i know they have talked about going to play together
488650 theyre all real good friends and theyre our team captains
488651 he was a big influence on them and has a great relationship with them
488652 we could have a simple relationship as friends but you made it complicate
488653 this is a great place to raise a family there are good schools here housing is relatively affordable we dont have a lot of traffic congestion so there are a lot of positives about the ohio area

488662 if i had known that all christians werent jerks i would have come to church a long time ago
488663 continue steadfastly in prayer being watchful in it with thanksgiving at the same time pray also for us that god may open to us a door for the word to declare the mystery of christ on account of which i am in prison that i may make it clear which is how i ought to speak conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders making the best use of the time let your speech always be gracious seasoned with salt so that you may know how you ought to answer each person
488664 conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders making the best use of the time
488665 when a person who does not know jesus scratches the surface of our life and witnesses our actions our motives our decisions as well as how we handle our money our time our energy our pleasure and most importantly of all our sin that person should be struck by how glorious jesus is and how amazing the salvation he offers is a transformed life through the spirits power is one of the most strategic and effective tools for evangelism
488666 with man this is impossible but with god all things are possible
488667 dead in the trespasses and sins following the course of this world following the prince of the power of the air the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience living in the passions of our flesh carrying out the desires of the body and the mind and are by nature children of wrath like the rest of mankind
488668 the power of god for salvation to everyone who believes to the jew first and also to the greek
488669 for everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved but how are they to call on him in whom they have not believed and how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard and how are they to hear without someone preaching and how are they to preach unless they are sent faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of christ
488670 the salt of the earth the light of the world a city set on a hill that cannot be hidden
488671 let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father who is in heaven
488672 it will not be enough for christians to simply live as individuals in the city they must live as a particular kind of community we christians are called to be an alternate city within every earthly city an alternate human culture within every human culture to show how sex money and power can be used in non destructive ways to show how classes and races who cannot get along outside of christ can get along in him and to show how it is possible to produce art that brings hope rather than despair or titillation in general a church must be more deeply and practically committed to deeds of compassion and social justice than traditional liberal churches and more deeply and practically committed to evangelism and conversion than traditional fundamentalist churches this kind of church is profoundly counter intuitive to american observers it breaks their ability to categorize and dismiss it as liberal or conservative only this kind of church has any chance in the non christian west
488673 beloved i urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh which wage war against your soul keep your conduct among the gentiles honorable so that when they speak against you as evil doers they may see your good deeds and glorify god on the day of visitation

488675 i think you better have a word with him yourself mary he says its urgent like hes in the hall
488676 what else attracted us about the business was there is a lot of room for growth although it has been a successful business there has not been full capacity use of the space
488677 although the business is viable in its current customer base this was something we said hey we can grow above and beyond what its already doing
488678 as i look at dayton and daytons had its challenges to say the least with its economy we feel very fortunate that were able to be part of a business that we believe is stable within the dayton community
488679 you shouldnt shake someone with post traumatic stress syndrome and survivors guilt awake in the middle of the night
488680 the move to this new street front location is exactly what the community needs we are now visible to all and have easy access for all of our customers
488681 a step toward the elimination of a competitor from the express delivery market
488682 we believe that this is the first step to dhl leaving the american market because by giving one of their primary competitors access to their customers it is only logical to believe that dhl will rapidly lose its customer base to ups it dhl will be unable to compete in this market

488690 you do not know silence like a cancer grows hear my words that i might teach you take my arms that i might reach you

488693 who was under a curse from the very day she was born she grew to be seventeen and was very beautiful but the curse made her prick her finger on a a funny spinning thing like a rose thorn and fall asleep
488694 when she woke up she was trapped inside a tower with only a white rose for company the only white rose in the world so every day she watered it and waited for her prince to come all around the tower grew hundreds of wild thorny rosebushes whose thorns killed anyone who tried to pass but after a hundred years had passed a prince with a heart as pure as a white rose came riding by he too tried to reach the tower and because his heart was so pure the roses bloomed for him and let him pass safely
488695 i guard this city for you and your people take it grow strong and help others
488696 i wish look i dont know how its going to happen or when i just know im not going to be here much longer
488697 bottom line is we expect to be able to negotiate an agreement by the end of this year
488698 we as a vendor cant build a new operational plan for them until weve got an agreement until they share information with us about their network and their package flows
488699 we are being relentless in our efforts to explore how we can stop this transaction on multiple fronts
488700 the purpose of our restructuring plan is to build a stronger foundation for sustained operations in the u s
488701 to do this a new operating model is required one that is better matched to the current economy and existing volumes
488702 both rising fuel prices and the downturn in the u s economy have had a significant impact on our operations and on the nature and timing of our restructuring plans

488711 answering a question about his approach to combatting sic crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge via it also sounds an awful lot like a police state mccain wants my government blew through my doors and killed my dogs
488712 they thought we were drug dealers and we were treated as such i dont think they really ever considered that we werent

488717 the smallest pore size is the key to the strength of porous materials and what they can do
488718 seeing inside bulk porous materials has never been done before at this resolution making this one of the first applications of x ray diffractive microscopy to a real problem
488719 the strength and stiffness of foam like structures are expected to scale with their density relating the density of individual elements like beams and nodes to the overall density
488720 but below about 10 percent density the strength of aerogels like the ones we tested on the order of 1 percent density is orders of magnitude less than expected
488721 the high resolution we achieved allowed us to see which of these models more accurately described the actual observed structure
488722 the structure was far more complex than anything wed seen in earlier images obtained using this technique
488723 wed like to use x ray diffraction to study a range of porous materials and nanostructures in general for example porous polymers developed at the molecular foundry for storing hydrogen as fuel and at even higher resolutions
488724 to do so david shapiro who built the end station we used for this work is working with us to overcome some obstacles
488725 and after all this you can find out the sample was no good so you have to start over
488726 we are also collaborating with berkeley labs computational research division to develop efficient and robust algorithms to speed up the time needed to construct the 3 d image from the individual rotated views
488727 this will open an entire spectrum of possibilities for new ways of seeing the very small not just aerogels but virtually any unknown object from nanostructures to biological cells

488769 the south is faced with a crisis of having to provide medical and support care for increasing numbers of infected individuals without adequate funding
488770 african american women are 83 percent of all new cases that we can document
488771 and the new epidemic is young people theyre between 22 and 24
488772 we have specific problems here in the south especially because of our rural areas transportation issues translation lack of access to proper health care
488773 some of those are parents in denial that their children are sexually active and people not getting tested
488774 people arent getting proper health care early on and are transmitting the disease to others
488775 even though we have now seen this increase in the south we are not seeing the increase in funding for the southern states
488776 rising infection rates coupled with inadequate funding resources and infrastructures
488777 a disparate and catastrophic situation in our public health care systems in the south
488778 there are vast geographic areas that encompass large cities less urban areas and rural areas that result in screening care treatment and housing challenges
488779 historically the south has also received the least amount of federal funding
488780 only 19 percent of u s philanthropic commitments for hiv aids
488781 age appropriate science driven education for prevention of all sexually transmitted diseases
488782 prevention treatment care and housing in the southern united states to rectify the historical inequities embedded in the federal hiv and std funding portfolios
488783 unless we act to correct funding and treatment disparities we endanger not just isolated communities but our states and our nation
488784 the helles family has become a military force and members of the family have been attacking abducting and even killing people we must put an end to their attacks on innocent citizens
488785 all attempts to convince them to hand suspects over have failed
488786 against hamass security forces and government in the gaza strip
488787 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
488788 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
488789 the data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the united states as well as black men and women
488790 it also mirrors what we see about sexually transmitted diseases and changes in risk behavior among men who have sex with men
488791 the reality is that it is a wake up call for all of us
488792 there are things that you and i can do to stop the disease encourage others to use condoms consistently and correctly abstain from sex
488793 it is important to note that the new estimate does not represent an actual increase in the annual number of new hiv infections
488794 in fact cdcs analysis suggests that the epidemic has been roughly stable since the late 1990s though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
488795 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s
488796 but ive done this before and i know what to expect
488797 the gop is bound and determined to win and they will try to win at all costs
488798 twenty of the worst bridges in the country are in oklahoma look at the bridge spanning highway 9 across interstate 35 its another example of the fact that the gop refuses to deal with the problems in oklahoma
488799 we have to look at the big picture how is this decision going to effect the whole state
488800 we should consider expanding the market for compressed natural gas its clean burning and cheap
488801 its the only mental health hospital remaining in the state
488802 not only are we going to look at the conditions at griffin but the pay and conditions for employees
488803 the republican leadership of the house runs the show if they dont like you you dont get heard

488811 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research
488812 they are manipulating the system by manipulating the definition of the word abortion
488813 its another example of this administrations disregard for science and medicine in how agencies make decisions
488814 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
488815 over the past three decades congress has passed several anti discrimination laws to protect institutional and individual health care providers participating in federal programs hhs has an obligation to enforce these laws and is exploring a number of options
488816 required to violate their consciences by providing or assisting in the provision of controversial medicine or procedures
488817 in general the department is concerned that the development of an environment in the health care industry that is intolerant of certain religious beliefs ethnic and cultural traditions and moral convictions may discourage individuals from underrepresented and diverse backgrounds from entering health care professions
488818 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
488819 any activity with a logical connection to a procedure health service or health service program or research activity this includes referral training and other arrangements of the procedure health service or research activity
488820 at a time when access to health care is at an all time low the idea that the bush administration would be creating more barriers is frankly incredible
488821 you could imagine a group of people with less than honorable intentions seeking to get hired at a family planning clinic with the specific objective of obstructing access under this regulation there is little you could do about it
488822 as soon as you have a definition in one part of federal law it can become the inspiration for the reinterpretation of other statutes
488823 this would essentially simply require people to comply with laws that they have been required to comply with for decades
488824 that does not mean any organization or state cant keep doing exactly what its been doing it means they have to make room for people who have sincere moral or ethical concerns about doing something
488825 health care professionals should not be forced to engage in an action that they see is the taking of a human life federal funds shouldnt be used for that kind of pressure
488826 religious freedom is an important part of the history of this country people who have a religious or moral belief should not be forced to participate in an act they find abhorrent

488839 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
488840 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
488841 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
488842 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
488843 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
488844 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
488845 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
488846 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
488847 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
488848 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
488849 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
488850 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
488851 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
488852 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
488853 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
488854 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
488855 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
488856 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
488857 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
488858 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
488859 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
488860 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
488861 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
488862 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
488863 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
488864 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
488865 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
488866 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
488867 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
488868 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
488869 the greater the obstacle the more glory in overcoming it
488870 the way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing
488871 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
488872 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
488873 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
488874 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
488875 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
488876 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
488877 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
488878 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
488879 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
488880 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
488881 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
488882 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
488883 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
488884 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
488885 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
488886 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
488887 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
488888 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
488889 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
488890 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
488891 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
488892 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
488893 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
488894 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
488895 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
488896 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
488897 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
488898 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
488899 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
488900 we will be down there in canton ohio with about nine or 10 coaches that were with gary

488903 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
488904 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
488905 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
488906 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
488907 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
488908 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
488909 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

488960 the government pays attention to important social issues this is one of them
488961 im joining the gay pride canal parade on behalf of the entire coalition
488962 the gay pride is a public event where people show they are gay or lesbian and are proud of being so
488963 it is important for the government to show it shares that pride we encourage that people dare being themselves and live the way they want we are keen to support to them with that and the ministrys boat at the parade aims to make that support visible
488964 we are very worried and outraged anti gay violence though it never disappeared is flaring in some urban neighbourhoods its to do with youths with an islamic background who are encouraged by the notion that homosexuality is morally repugnant this is extremely worrying when i talk about this at schools it is shocking to hear how some young people think and talk about his so a lot remains to be done and not only at urban schools queer bashing is something all kinds of youths do after drinking all around the country
488965 i expect that this years parade will like those in past years be extravagant but decent so people will be able to take their children to watch it of course its provocative but thats part of the fun its part of the point

488992 genau das tun wir seit einigen wochen bei nick ich habe ans tze gesehen dass er wieder nach vorne kommt das heute war pech das kann auch einem anderen passieren
488993 wir haben erlebt wie wir am anfang der saison mit technikproblemen umgegangen sind das jetzt ist im prinzip genau dasselbe es macht keinen sinn bei problemen die pferde zu wechseln sondern man muss das paket das da ist so optimal wie m glich zum arbeiten bringen

489025 the most serious incident was eating a business related dinner with a large group of women ordering dessert and then freaking out when the table just expected me to take one bite and pass it around to everyone who had their forks poised i very firmly said that it was my dessert and i was not sharing and ate it while everyone watched key lime pie makes me act like that
489026 in high school i was athlete of the year and led my team to a professional championship
489027 i was also a member of the canada games team which is a pretty elite team here in canada and then i went to the university and played three years on the university team i was the captain for my last two years and i had a pretty good volleyball career i was a power hitter
489028 i had finished my volleyball career and i was still looking to stay involved in athletics i had done team sports my whole life and i was looking to get into a sport that was more individualized something where if you had the best game or the best performance of your life then you probably won whereas with team sports you can have a great performance as an individual and your team can still lose so i wanted to get into something just individualized and on the road trips for volleyball we used to watch the ufc when it was in its very early stages it interested me and i thought id give it a try ive always been one of those guys thats been pretty open minded and i thought ive been good at anything i put my mind to so i decided im going to just put my mind into becoming the next ultimate fighting guy
489029 originally i was just doing it as a hobby i was working as a correctional officer and im not so sure that i picked it as much as it picked me i was only training as a hobby and i started to get pretty good the more i sparred and the more i trained the better i got and just one day it all dawned on me hey i could really be good at this i could really take this somewhere then i buckled down started training seriously and then fighting seriously
489030 im fortunate that ive had many fights before the ufc because im not sure early in my career if i would have been ready for the ufc i feel that all those fights that i had prior to getting into the ufc really made me the fighter i am today i had a lot of ups and downs and a lot of tough fights and i learned a lot about myself and about my fighting through those fights i think they helped me to get to where i am today at the time it was frustrating you were seeing guys get into the ufc with just 2 3 4 5 fights and they didnt have a ton of experience there were guys getting into the ufc through the ultimate fighter television show that had very limited experience it was frustrating for me to look at it that way but i always wanted to be part of the ufc and i knew if i just continued to fight and worked hard and built my record that someday id make it there

489050 now i may not look like those dead presidents such as franklin and susan b anthony and i dont mean its because im black republicans who wont tell you that they are all white every single one of them they want to scare you because im different and full of hope and change and black too but i will never make race an issue in this campaign with its proud black heritage just ask my mom i have always been clear on this have never wavered nor had any doubts that my position on race in this campaign is to never ever mention that i am black and it scares you and im black too

489122 4th ecpp part 2 3 three distinct lessons ive learnt
489123 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
489124 when comparing the most advanced mortals in mind and soul condition they are not equal to us in development this makes me wonder what improvement could be made in our condition in order for us to progress should we enter into another mortal body yet strangely we cling to our old belief in reincarnation and congregate together waiting for something that must happen in order for reincarnation to become the destiny of our souls
489125 when i reached the spirit world i found such glory and happiness and beauty that i now realize this little earth is a grammar school not a university or even a high school it is only the first lesson of life
489126 you can learn in one day here what takes years to learn on earth forget reincarnation because it is a sandbag around your neck you will have it so centered on your mind that you will think of nothing else and you will stay just where you are you cannot progress because your mind will always revert to the earth again you cannot live on the earth more than once life is progression not retrogression
489127 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
489128 take the chair in front of us and try not to be nervous
489129 what are all these spirits doing in the room get them out of here

489331 coach zook is trying to install in me to have the mind set that its my team this is my year
489332 thats an added role for me to be a leader and think of this as my team
489333 its not that difficult its a transition that slowly happens i could see it happen with some of the guys last year i can be more outspoken and more demanding of the offense receivers tell me its your team what do you want me to do theyre out there to listen
489334 for the success of late last year to carry over to this year will be huge
489335 offensive coordinator mike locksley has done a great job with him knowing where to go with the ball thats the biggest thing
489336 when you know where to go with the ball your accuracy is going to go up if youre not sure you dont throw as much
489337 that might be a little higher than it has to be but if you complete 70 percent of our passes you have a chance to be pretty good
489338 i took the shot against missouri and that threw everything off the next week i wasnt making reads i was trying to get out of the way so that definitely had an effect on me and that bled over to the next few games there was talk about me being replaced so that was more added pressure
489339 after we lost to iowa i prayed about it just told myself to go out and have fun if im getting pulled thats whats going to happen i just needed to get if off my back and have fun in the locker room again
489340 it was hard for me to understand that the first couple of years because the way i led was by example i wasnt really a rah rah guy who gave speeches it was to do my job and hope everyone follows

489343 my dad with his son and me with my son
489344 thats my dad i cant be mad at him or try to disown him or anything like that
489345 i dont think thats fair to him he made a bad decision paid the price for it i dont think he needs to come home and face that from me
489346 everything for him was just eye popping it was so good to interact with him we spent the whole day together
489347 thats where every team wants to run the ball right up the middle
489348 he is a live wire a great personality to have around and eats up blockers he does a good job of staying in his gap
489349 we were very pleased with anthony last year and ive noticed he is in a lot better shape at the beginning of this camp too
489350 i think all the different role models i had my mom larry johnson sr an assistant coach at penn state a friend who is a single dad made me respect and honor being a solid guy

489356 in his famous two cultures lecture cp snow lamented the deep divide that separates the arts and humanities in modern culture but recent work published in genome biology by researchers rie takahashi and jeffrey h miller at the university of california los angeles ucla might be a step towards healing the rift the scientists designed a computer programme that turns genes into music the resulting tunes are surprisingly melodic and have a curious resonance with the roots of both western music and science 26 centuries ago
489357 i dont think the causal link has been proved i think cannabis might possibly for genetic reasons trigger psychosis at an earlier age
489358 i would like to ask the premier league a number of questions how can a player with a signed agreement be treated like this
489359 he has a document which is clear but the premier league prefers to believe the word of someone else who made a mistake i know there were accusations made against liverpool in the hearing which were unbelievable how can this be allowed
489360 then i would like to ask the premier league why is it that liverpool always plays the most fixtures away from home in an early kick off following an international break
489361 we had more than the top clubs last season and we have four already to prepare for this season
489362 then i want to ask the premier league why it was so difficult for liverpool to sign javier mascherano when we had to wait a long time for the paperwork but it was so easy for carlos tevez to join manchester united
489363 its going to be very difficult for us to win the premier league because the other teams are so strong but i want our supporters to know that despite the disadvantages we have we will fight all the way
489364 we will fight to cope with our more difficult kick off times and all the other decisions which are going against us
489365 we are extremely disappointed with the result and we will be appealing
489366 the premier league tried to make sure that our dealings with all our member clubs including the scheduling of fixtures are as fair as possible
489367 we are disappointed to read rafael benitezs comments in the press especially when channels exist for every member club to raise any issues directly with the league
489368 it is the greatest gift since the fall of saddam hussein and shows how iraqis from all walks of life can work together to achieve success

489370 i feel profoundly identified with rogers intense personal involvement with benjamins story who indeed can feel that they
489371 thought can be as intoxicating as any narcotic not to mention that drug we take in solitude ourselves
489372 the arts are a fundamental part of a confident and cultured society they challenge and inspire us they bring beauty excitement and enjoyment into our lives they help us express our identity as individuals as members of communities and as a nation
489373 we thought it was in our best interest as mannys dreadlocks to refuse to go to los angeles i mean do you really think theres a decent rastafarian hairstylist in hollywood i dont think so when we heard we might be going to florida that was okay because of all the stray boatloads of haitians coming in and out west where would we live knowing manny he would probably move to compton to try and save a few bucks everyone knows that dreadlocks and weave dont get along
489374 short of los angeles importing some quality jamaicans i dont think so

489437 after 27 years the united states lacks a coherent strategy for combating the hiv aids epidemic reflected in this disturbing increase in the estimate of hiv incidence
489438 the revised cdc figure represents an unacceptable level of new hiv infections for a preventable disease the revised estimate underlines the need for a national aids strategy with measurable outcomes reliance on evidence based programs and sufficient funding stopping the spread of hiv and treating all people living with hiv must be a high priority for our leaders and the american public
489439 the higher estimate of annual new hiv infections does not mean that hiv prevention does not work what is failing is national leadership to fund and support sound scientifically effective hiv prevention programs
489440 federal law blocks federal funding for syringe exchange programs which the scientific literature has demonstrated clearly as an effective hiv prevention tool support for comprehensive sex education that helps keep young people healthy is neglected while the current administration supports pouring millions of dollars into abstinence only programs that have been proven to be ineffective
489441 this is not just another set of statistics there are people behind these numbers people are becoming infected with a disease that is preventable we know how to prevent hiv but we have been fighting this epidemic with one hand tied behind our back reflecting a disturbing dismissal of hiv prevention as a public health priority
489442 the new higher estimate is yet one more wake up call to our national leaders that they need to do more starting with developing and implementing a real national aids strategy

489478 a beautiful 10 day experience in antigua at cocos the hotel was recommended to us by friends who are repeat visitors so we were happy to go along with that and glad we did appartments were clean and welcoming but certainly not the best i have seen even in the caribbean service was good but not exceptional but the food was enjoyable and cant be faulted
489479 however as recent events indicate the hotel by virtue of its layout does not offer the greatest security and there is a trade off for seclusion my wife and i were woken a couple of times by noises in the night and we commented on the fact that we did feel vulnerable
489480 we went to antigua because of its reputation as a safe and secure west indies island and for that reason discounted many other possibilities however cocos was a good hotel and probably no less safe than others on the island i can recommend the hotel but we wont be staying there again ourselves

489665 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
489666 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
489667 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
489668 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
489669 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
489670 the item you requested is not currently unavailable in the us store
489671 netshare is it up or is it down i really dont care
489672 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
489673 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
489674 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
489675 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
489676 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
489677 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
489678 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
489679 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
489680 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
489681 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
489682 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
489683 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
489684 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
489685 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
489686 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
489687 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
489688 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
489689 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
489690 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
489691 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
489692 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
489693 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
489694 frank wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that
489695 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
489696 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
489697 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
489698 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
489699 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
489700 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
489701 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
489702 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
489703 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
489704 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
489705 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
489706 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
489707 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
489708 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
489709 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
489710 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
489711 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
489712 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
489713 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
489714 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
489715 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
489716 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
489717 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
489718 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
489719 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
489720 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
489721 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
489722 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
489723 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
489724 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
489725 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
489726 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
489727 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
489728 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
489729 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
489730 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
489731 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
489732 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
489733 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
489734 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
489735 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
489736 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
489737 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
489738 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
489739 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
489740 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
489741 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
489742 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
489743 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
489744 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
489745 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
489746 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
489747 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
489748 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
489749 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
489750 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
489751 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
489752 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
489753 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
489754 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
489755 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
489756 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
489757 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
489758 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
489759 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars

489765 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
489766 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
489767 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
489768 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
489769 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
489770 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
489771 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
489772 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
489773 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
489774 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
489775 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
489776 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
489777 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
489778 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
489779 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
489780 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
489781 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
489782 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
489783 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
489784 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
489785 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
489786 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
489787 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
489788 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
489789 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
489790 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
489791 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
489792 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
489793 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
489794 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god

489796 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
489797 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
489798 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
489799 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
489800 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
489801 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
489802 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
489803 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
489804 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
489805 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
489806 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
489807 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
489808 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
489809 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
489810 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
489811 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
489812 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
489813 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
489814 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
489815 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
489816 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
489817 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
489818 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
489819 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
489820 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
489821 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
489822 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
489823 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
489824 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
489825 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
489826 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
489827 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
489828 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
489829 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
489830 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
489831 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
489832 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
489833 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
489834 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
489835 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
489836 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
489837 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
489838 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
489839 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
489840 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
489841 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
489842 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
489843 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
489844 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
489845 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
489846 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
489847 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
489848 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
489849 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
489850 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
489851 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
489852 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
489853 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
489854 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
489855 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
489856 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
489857 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
489858 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
489859 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
489860 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
489861 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
489862 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
489863 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
489864 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
489865 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
489866 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
489867 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
489868 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
489869 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
489870 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
489871 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
489872 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
489873 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
489874 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
489875 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
489876 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
489877 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
489878 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
489879 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
489880 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
489881 its like an abortion the way they did that roof i keep waiting for one of my guys to fall through hahahaha
489882 tear the roof off the sucka tear the roof off the mothersucka tear the roof off the sucka
489883 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
489884 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
489885 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet

489890 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
489891 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
489892 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
489893 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
489894 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
489895 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
489896 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
489897 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
489898 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
489899 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
489900 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
489901 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
489902 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
489903 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products

489915 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
489916 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
489917 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
489918 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
489919 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
489920 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
489921 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
489922 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
489923 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

489929 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
489930 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident

489932 you know its not about you its about your country
489933 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
489934 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
489935 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
489936 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
489937 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
489938 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
489939 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
489940 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
489941 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
489942 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
489943 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
489944 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
489945 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
489946 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
489947 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
489948 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
489949 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
489950 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
489951 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
489952 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
489953 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
489954 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
489955 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
489956 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
489957 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
489958 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
489959 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
489960 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
489961 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
489962 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
489963 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick

489965 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
489966 after a thorough extensive public process the commission has authorized this critical upgrade to the transmission system

489972 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
489973 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation

489980 i am taurus sun leo moon vanity will not allow a lot of weight gain
489981 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
489982 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
489983 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
